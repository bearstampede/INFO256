E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/21/2013 
TAGS: MOPS PREL AF IT IRAQI FREEDOM
SUBJECT: ITALIAN TROOPS IN OEF 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: CHARGE D'AFFAIRES EMIL SKODON FOR REASONS 1.5(B)(D) 
 
 ¶1. (C)  CHARGE, ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFF, MET WITH ACTING 
DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO THE PRIME MINISTER FRANCESCO TALO ON 
AUGUST 20 TO DISCUSS A RANGE OF ISSUES (OTHER ISSUES REPORTED 
    SEPTEL).  CHARGE TOLD TALO THAT THE U.S. WAS PLEASED WITH THE 
HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL PERFORMANCE OF THE ITALIAN OEF CONTINGENT 
IN KHOST, AND ASKED WHAT THE REACTION MIGHT BE SHOULD ITALY 
BE ASKED TO CONSIDER EXTENDING ITS OEF DEPLOYMENT PAST THE 
SCHEDULED SEPTEMBER 15 DEPARTURE DATE. TALO REPLIED THAT THE 
ANSWER WOULD DEPEND LARGELY ON WHETHER THE MOD CAN FIND THE 
RESOURCES.  IN THE EVENT A FORMAL USG REQUEST TO EXTEND IS 
MADE, THE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE WOULD LOOK FIRST TO THE MOD 
TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT ON AVAILABLE RESOURCES, ALREADY 
STRETCHED VERY THIN.  WITH THE MAJORITY OF SENIOR ITALIAN 
OFFICIALS OUT OF ROME ON HOLIDAY, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO GET 
A QUICK RESPONSE EVEN IF A FORMAL REQUEST IS MADE. 
 
¶2. (C)  TALO WENT ON TO SAY THAT ITALY NOW HAS 13,000 TROOPS 
DEPLOYED OVERSEAS; MORE, HE STRESSED, THAN EVEN GERMANY. 
ITALY KNEW IT WAS PUSHING AGAINST THE MOD'S CEILING OF 
DEPLOYED TROOPS WHEN THE COMMITMENT TO CONTRIBUTE 1,000 
SOLDIERS TO OEF WAS MADE, TALO SAID.  SINCE THEN, ITALY HAD 
DEPLOYED EVEN MORE TROOPS IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO USG REQUESTS 
FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OIF, AND WAS STRETCHED EVEN THINNER. 
(NOTE: WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE MOD CONSIDERS THE MAXIMUM 
SUSTAINABLE NUMBER OF TROOPS ABROAD TO BE 10,000, WITH ROOM 
FOR AN UNSUSTAINABLE 11-12,000 SURGE. END NOTE.) 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT.  WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM OUR INFORMAL 
APPROACHES TO THE ITALIAN DEFENSE GENERAL STAFF AND TO THE 
PM'S STAFF IS THAT AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES IS KEY AND THE 
RESOURCE PICTURE IS NOT ENCOURAGING.  IN THE ABSENCE OF 
OFFICIAL INSTRUCTIONS, WE HAVE NOT CONSULTED WITH VACATIONING 
SENIOR ITALIAN DECISION-MAKERS.  HOWEVER, IN AN INTERVIEW TO 
BE RELEASED ON AUGUST 22, DEFMIN MARTINO REPORTEDLY SAID THAT 
    THE ITALIAN OEF CONTINGENT WILL NOT REMAIN IN AFGHANISTAN 
AFTER ITS MANDATE EXPIRES ON SEPTEMBER 15.  ITALIAN TROOPS 
ARE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN WITHDRAWING FROM BAGHRAM ON AUGUST 22. 
 IF THE US MILITARY DECIDES AN EXTENSION IS NECESSARY, A 
HIGH-LEVEL DOD CALL TO MARTINO MAY BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY 
TO PERSUADE THE MOD TO CONSIDER FILLING THE GAP.
