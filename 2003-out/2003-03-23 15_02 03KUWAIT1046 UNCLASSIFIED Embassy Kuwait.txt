WASHINGTON TIME MARCH 21. 
 
¶2. EVENTS SINCE LAST SITREP (all reported times are 
Kuwait Local, GMT plus three): 
 
----------------- 
Security/Military 
----------------- 
 
In the past twelve hours, we have had two "duck-and- 
cover" alerts in response to reported launches of 
surface-to-surface missiles from Iraq.  The most recent 
was at approximately 2326.  No/no reports of damage 
or casualties, nor any indication of chemical or 
biological warheads were reported. 
 
--------- 
Political 
--------- 
 
The Kuwaiti MFA contacted the Ops Center to confirm the legitimacy 
of visa applications being made in their London Embassy on behalf 
of ORHA.  Working with Kuwait Desk Officer and ORHA team members 
in Kuwaiti, Ops Officer was able to confirm the applications were 
legitimate and pass this information to the MFA.

Consular 
-------- 
 
The remaining stranded Amcit passengers reported earlier have 
departed Kuwait on Kuwait Airways for Chicago via London this 
afternoon. 
 
Fourteen Amcits have requested Embassy assistance to depart from 
Kuwait.  While the majority have requested assistance in obtaining 
flight reservations, four have requested assistance with Saudi 
transit visas.  Embassy Consular officers will be assisting these 
Amcits tomorrow a.m.  Embassy Consular officer released Warden 
Notice number 11, which reinforced all previous warnings to 
American citizens living in Kuwait to be vigilant and practice 
good personal safety and security measures.  Kuwait International 
Airport remains open, although most carriers have suspended or 
restricted service.  However, Kuwait Airways is flying at close to 
normal operations. 
 
An Embassy Consular officer and FSN met with Congen Dhahran and 
Kuwaiti border officials at the Kuwaiti/Saudi border today.  The 
Kuwaiti border officials reported that no Americans citizens have 
tried to cross the border since the start of hostilities between 
Iraq and U.S.  Kuwaiti authorities claim that during the past few 
days, approximately 5,000 Arabs/Kuwaitis have crossed the 
Kuwaiti/Saudi border, which is down from a normal of 12,000 people 
on the weekend.  The Consular officer and Congen confirmed that 
the Saudi Embassy in Kuwait will issue gratis "emergency transit 
visas" to American citizens in Kuwait, if the situation 
deteriorated.

Management 
---------- 
 
At the request of TFIZ01, we confirmed through OMC-K that, as of 
1655 only 9 oil fires had been set by Iraqi forces at the Rumalya 
oil/gas separation facility; 2 of the 9 were extinguished by 
civilian contractors moving with the 1st Marine Expeditionary 
Force (1MEF) in Southern Iraq.  This contradicts a CNN report that 
fifteen oil fires were burning in Rumalya.
