SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) Jamal Rifai, member of Jordan's al Mustaqbel Party and 
freelance journalist, told us September 22 that there will be 
a conference September 25 in Baghdad including 17 Iraqi 
political parties.  Rifai outlined his involvement with the 
Iraqi Salam party and its participation in the conference, 
which he hoped the CPA would both attend and support.  End 
Summary.

SALAM PARTY - LEAD ORGANIZER 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) According to Rifai, the Salam (Peace) party, organized 
the conference to allow Iraqis a "moderate" choice in the 
muddled political landscape of Iraq.  The party, he claimed, 
is composed of Kurds, Shi'a and Sunnis.  The party slogan is 
"Iraq is our identity, Peace is our choice".  Their platform 
favors freedom of the press and speech, full rights for women 
and children, demilitarization of Iraqi society, canceling 
the military draft, and depoliticization and establishment of 
a national Iraqi army.  It further favors separation of 
religion and politics and rejects involvement of religious 
clerics in political life.  The Salam party platform respects 
the U.S. role in liberating Iraq and accepts the presence of 
coalition forces in Iraq until an Iraqi government and army 
is in place.

CONFERENCE GOAL: REACH OUT TO IRAQIS AND THE CPA 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶3. (U) Rifai related how past attempts to initiate dialogue 
between the 17 party coalition and the Coalition Provisional 
Authority (CPA) have failed.  He said Salam party leader, 
Saleh Abu Khumrah, wonders why the CPA seems to favor 
dialogue with what they deem as "outside" political parties 
that don't enjoy the support of average Iraqis and cannot 
ensure future stability and security in Iraq. Rifai added 
that all the major news organizations based in Baghdad have 
been invited to cover the conference.

CONFERENCE FACTS

¶4. (U) The conference is scheduled for September 25 at the 
Sheraton Hotel's "Tamuz" room.  According to Rifai, about 250 
delegates from all over Iraq are expected, and invitations 
have been sent to Amb. Bremer and other CPA officials.  Rifai 
added that these delegates were taking a big risk by reaching 
out to the CPA and were in need of both "moral" and 
"political" support.

COMMENT

¶5. (C) We cannot vouch for Jamal Rifai, and the Mustaqbel 
Party is not a major political player in Jordan.  We pass on 
this information for the record. 
 
¶6. (U) Baghdad minimize considered.
