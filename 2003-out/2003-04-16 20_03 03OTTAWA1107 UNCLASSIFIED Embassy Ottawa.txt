¶1. As of April 15, 2003, Health Canada has received 
reports of 296 probable or suspect cases of severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There have 
been 13 deaths in Canada - all clustered in Toronto, 
Ontario.  To date, transmission has been limited to 
specific transmission settings such as households, 
hospitals and specific community settings.  The 
following figures reflect the situation as of 13:00 
Eastern Daylight Saving Time, April 15, unless 
otherwise noted: 
¶2. Ontario is reporting 105 probable and 139 suspect 
cases. All cases have occurred in persons who have 
traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the 
household or in a health-care setting. (See Toronto 
reporting for details.) 
¶3. British Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 37

standard practice will be that suspect cases will 
continue to be counted as a suspect case until there is 
a definitive test to confirm or rule out the disease.
