SUBJECT: BRIEFING THE TURKS ON USG FOLLOW-UP WITH EU 
REGARDING TERRORIST DESIGNATION OF KADEK/KONGRA GEL 
 
 
REF: STATE 344619 
 
 
(U) Classified by Polcouns John Kunstadter; reasons: 1.5 
(b,d). 
 
 
¶1. (C) On receipt of reftel text we briefed MFA DDG for 
counter-terrorism Asya on new USG follow-up with EU capitals 
to press for EU designation of PKK morphs KADEK and KONGRA 
GEL as terrorist organizations.  Thanking us for continuing 
USG efforts with the EU, Asya said designation of KADEK is no 
longer of interest since it has ceased to exist; the key is 
for the EU to designate KONGRA GEL in a timely manner. 
 
 
¶2. (C) Noting the USG's shoulder-to-shoulder cooperation 
against the PKK for almost 20 years and at the same time the 
EU's day-late-dollar-short terrorist designation for the PKK, 
we asked whether Asya could explain the continuing criticism 
of the U.S. and absence of more vigorous reproaches of the 
EU.  Initially shrugging his shoulders, Asya eventually 
acknowledged with an embarrassed look that anti-U.S. 
criticism emanates in part from various disgruntled sections 
of the deeper parts of the Turkish State.
