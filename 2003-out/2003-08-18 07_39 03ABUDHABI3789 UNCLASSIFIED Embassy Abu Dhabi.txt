WITH INCREASINGLY DAUNTING RESPONSIBILITIES, INCLUDING THE 
FORMATION OF AN IRAQI GOVERNMENT AND DRAFTING A NEW CONSTITUTION 
FOR THE COUNTRY." 
 
"IN EXTENDING THIS SUPPORT TO COUNCIL, SAID THE SOURCE, THE UAE 
IS FULFILLING ITS GREATER NATIONAL OBLIGATIONS IN SUPPORTING THE 
IRAQI PEOPLE AT THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE.  THE UAE, ADDED THE

¶6.  DESCRIBING THE IRAQI GOVERNING COUNCIL'S VISIT TO THE UAE AS 
A 'GOOD CHOICE,' SEMI-OFFICIAL ABU DHABI-BASED ARABIC DAILY "AL- 
ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED 8/17: 
 
"... THE UAE IS WELCOMING TODAY A DELEGATION OF THE IRAQI 
GOVERNING COUNCIL CHAIRED BY MR. IBRAHIM AL JA'AFARI, THE 
COUNCIL'S PRESIDENT ... THIS WILL DEFINITELY LEAD THE COUNCIL TO 
ACHIEVE THE IRAQI PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS FOR STABILITY AND PEACE 
AND THE PROTECTION OF ITS NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND UNITY ... WE 
HOPE THAT THIS VISIT WILL BE A GOOD START FOR COMMUNICATION, 
DELIBERATION, AND THINKING BETWEEN THE IRAQI PEOPLE'S 
REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR BROTHERS IN THE ARAB WORLD.  THIS WILL 
LEAD TO ELIMINATING THE VEIL THAT HAS BEEN PLACED ACROSS THEIR 
EYES ..." 
 
¶7.  COMMENTING ON THE UAE'S SUPPORT OF THE IRAQI GOVERNING 
COUNCIL, ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL ARAB" 
EDITORIALIZED 8/17: 
 
"... VIEWPOINTS MIGHT DIFFER WHEN IT COMES TO THE WAY THE 
GOVERNING COUNCIL WAS CHOSEN... OR WHEN IT COMES TO ITS 
RESPONSIBILITIES, AUTHORITIES, AND INFLUENCE ... THESE ARE NORMAL 
DIFFERENCES IN SUCH A SITUATION ...  BUT NO ONE DISAGREES THAT 
THE COUNCIL INCLUDES A NUMBER OF NATIONAL PERSONALITIES WHO ARE 
WELL KNOWN WITH THEIR ROLES IN PREVIOUS ERAS WHEN IRAQ NEEDED A 
RIGHTEOUS VOICE IN THE FACE OF A 'TYRANNICAL SULTAN' ... THE 
UAE'S SUPPORTIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE TRANSITIONAL COUNCIL IS A 
CONTINUATION OF THE PATH THAT THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN PURSUING IN 
THEIR WELL-BALANCED FOREIGN POLICY ..."

EDITORIALIZED 8/17: 
 
"... THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT TRANSLATIONS OF THE ROADMAP, AND 
THERE ARE TWO PARALLEL LINES THAT WILL NEVER MEET ... THE 
PALESTINIANS TRANSLATE THE ROADMAP TO MEAN THAT THE RIGHT OF THE 
REFUGEES TO RETURN AT THE FINAL STAGE OF ANY SOLUTION TO THE 
PALESTINIAN CAUSE.  AS FOR THE ISRAELIS, THEY BELIEVE THAT THE 
RIGHT OF RETURN IS IMPOSSIBLE ... ANY SOLUTION THAT DOES NOT 
INCLUDE THE RIGHT OF RETURN IS DEFECTIVE AND IS REJECTED ..."
