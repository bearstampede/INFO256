FROM ASHLEY WILLS 
 
E.O. 12958:  N/A 
TAGS: APER CE
SUBJECT:  JIM WALLER 
 
Â¶1.  As you know, the Sri Lankan account has been very 
busy these past few months and promises to remain so for 
a long period. I doubt Jim Waller realized when he took 
over the Desk just how much work there would be!  In the 
event, he has nevertheless has performed wonderfully in 
support of this Mission, and I want to bring his 
outstanding work to your attention.  Unfailingly polite 
and self effacing, Jim Waller is incredibly hard 
working, detail-oriented and fluent in his drafting, 
whether preparing briefing memos for D or email reports 
giving us in Colombo a sense of how things are unfolding 
in Washington.  In the hurly burly of our profession, 
especially now that the whole Department is under siege 
because of the war in Iraq, I wanted to take this 
occasion to single out Jim Waller for my warmest praise 
and thanks for a job extremely well done.
