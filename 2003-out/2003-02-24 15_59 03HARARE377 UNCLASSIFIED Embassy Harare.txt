  ¶1.   Under headline "Africa and the French connection" 
      the pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" 
      dedicated its February 23 edition to hailing French 
      President Jacques Chirac and African leaders for 
      coming out with a collective communiqu, at the just 
      ended Franco-Africa Summit in Paris, opposed to a war 
      against Iraq.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   "The Franco-Africa summit ended in Paris on 
      Friday, amid British and American anxiety on France's 
      success in rallying Africa and most of the developing 
      world against the current wave of Anglo-American 
      imperialism. . .  His biggest coup was the support he 
      received from African leaders on his anti-war stance 
      on Iraq.  Much to the chagrin of Tony Blair and George 
      Bush, African leaders signed a French document that 
      expresses support for continued U. N. inspections and 
      which states that, `there is an alternative to war. . 
      . .'"
