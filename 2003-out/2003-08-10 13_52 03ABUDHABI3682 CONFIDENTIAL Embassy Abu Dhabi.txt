SUBJECT:  UAEG REQUESTS GUIDANCE ON RAFIDAIN BANK 
 
REFS: A) ABU DHABI 3476    B) ABU DHABI 2275 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Charge D'Affaires Richard A. Albright 
for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (U) This is an action request; please see paragraph 4. 
 
¶3.  (C) The UAE Central Bank forwarded a copy to Post of a 
July 26 letter to Treasury Secretary Snow seeking guidance 
on the liquidation of Rafidain Bank in the UAE (ref A). 
The letter states that, as a result of USG confiscation of 
Rafidain Bank's assets in New York, the bank is now in 
"gross violation" of the UAE's own capital adequacy 
requirements.  (Note: Per ref B, Rafidain Bank currently 
maintains total assets of USD $18.8 million, USD $17.3 
million of which are frozen in the United States and 
Germany.  The UAE Central Bank has managed the limited 
operations of the single branch of Rafidain Bank in the UAE 
since the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  End note.) 
 
¶4.  (C) Action request: The letter from the Central Bank 
further states that its Board of Directors already has 
removed Rafidain Bank from the Register of Banks in the UAE 
and seeks to liquidate the branch -- pending USG approval. 
Post appreciates any guidance from Washington that we can 
pass to the Central Bank regarding the 
modalities/legalities of closing Rafidain Bank in the UAE, 
and provision for the remaining USD $1.5 million.  End 
action request.
