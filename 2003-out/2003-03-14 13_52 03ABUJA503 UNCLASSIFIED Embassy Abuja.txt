 ¶1.  I.A.D. Nuhu of MFA's Department of Consular and Legal 
Affairs March 6 confirmed to Poloff that he had met often 
with UNHCR representative Eusebe Hounsokou and that the GON 
was interested in accepting refugees from Cote D,Ivoire. 
 
 
¶2.  Nuhu referred to Nigeria,s existing refugee camps, 
pointing out that the infrastructural capacities of these 
camps were already stretched to their limit.  Nigeria would 
be hard-pressed to sustain additional refugees in these 
camps.  He suggested that the GON might consider voluntary 
repatriation for numerous Sierre Leonan refugees currently in 
the camps in a way to relieve some of the congestion. 
 
 
¶3.  Nuhu suggested the GON would be willing to accept from 
1000 to 5000 refugees, possibly within the next few months. 
He said that concerned GON officials would be meeting with 
the UNHCR again the week of March 10, and implied that many 
of the logistical details may be sorted out then.  Poloff 
will follow up with Nuhu at the end of the week. 
 
 
¶4.  Abidjan minimize considered.
