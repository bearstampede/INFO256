Â¶1. (C) On February 9, A/PolCouns delivered reftel points on 
Switzerland's proposed February 15-16 conference in Geneva to 
coordinate assistance to a post-war Iraq to FM Muasher's 
personal assistant Ali al-Ayed.  Al-Ayed said that the GOJ 
had already been informed of U.S. concerns and the reasons 
behind our decision not to participate via its mission in 
Geneva.  He also confirmed that after internal discussion of 
the matter, Jordan has decided it will be represented at the 
conference by its Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, 
Shaher Bak.  He noted that that the Swiss conference falls on 
the same dates as an Arab League Ministerial in Cairo and 
that FM Muasher would be busy with the latter.
