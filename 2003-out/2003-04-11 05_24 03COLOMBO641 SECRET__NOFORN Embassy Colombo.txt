REF: Colombo 00623 
 
(U) Classified by S.V. Wright, Regional Security Officer, 
reason 1.5(C) and (D). 
 
¶1.   (SBU) On April 11, 2003 Colombo Emergency Action 
  Committee (EAC) met to discuss the local security situation. 
  The DCM chaired the EAC. 
 
¶2.   (SBU) The EAC agreed that Colombo appears calm; the 
  trend of decreasing agitation continues.  We expect some 
  protests throughout the country and in Colombo today after 
  Friday prayers, but continue to expect these will be small 
  and well controlled by the Sri Lanka Police.  This weekend 
  marks the beginning of a holiday week in Sri Lanka that 
  includes the Singhalese and Tamil New Year's celebrations 
  and Easter. We expect virtually all Sri Lankans to be 
  focused on these events rather than events in Iraq and 
  elsewhere. 
 
¶3.   (SBU) The EAC decided to disband the use of the LAV 
  shuttle effective COB Friday April 11 unless the security 
  situation degrades.  The Embassy will be closed Monday April 
  14 for a local holiday.  The EAC will convene again and 
  reassess the security situation Tuesday April 15. 
 
¶4.   (SBU) The local police will remain deployed at all the 
  residences for one more week. 
 
¶5.   (SBU) Previous in-country travel restrictions remain in 
  effect. 
 
¶6.   (S) RSO reminded EAC members of our walk-in procedures 
  and that if any person claiming knowledge of any threat 
  information approaches any employee, Post 1 and/or RSO must 
  be contacted immediately. (RSO and DCM will meet with the 
  Subject of reftel on Saturday April 12.  Following initial 
  assessment, RSO will arrange for follow-up meetings and 
  interviews, if appropriate.)
