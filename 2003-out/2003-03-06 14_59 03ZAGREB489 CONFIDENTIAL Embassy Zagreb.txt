SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) IN A MARCH 3 INTRODUCTORY CALL ON NEW DEPUTY FOREIGN 
MINISTER SIMONOVIC, THE AMBASSADOR REVIEWED THE U.S. APPROACH 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00489  01 OF 03  061511Z 
ON IRAQ, STEPS TOWARD CROATIA,S CANDIDACY FOR NATO 
MEMBERSHIP, THE SFRY ASSETS SUCCESSION ISSUES, OUR REQUEST 
FOR AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH CROATIA, ICTY COMPLIANCE, 
REFUGEE RETURNS AND THE UPCOMING UNCHR SESSION.  SIMONOVIC 
CONFIRMED THAT CROATIA DOES NOT SEE A MAJOR ROLE FOR ITSELF 
ON IRAQ, BUT STILL WANTED TO BE SUPPORTIVE.  CROATIA WOULD 
READILY PURSUE REGIONAL INITIATIVES (INCLUDING THE ADRIATIC 
CHARTER) BUT DID NOT WANT TO ENDANGER CLOSE TIES TO WESTERN 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  SIMONOVIC SAID CROATIA DID NOT WANT TO 
BE AN OBSTACLE TO THE UNFREEZING OF SFRY ASSETS AND WANTED A 
QUICK RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS WITH THE AGREEMENT ON 
SUCCESSION ISSUES.  HE SAID THAT THE GOC MUST DO A BETTER JOB 
ON ICTY AND REFUGEE RETURNS.  ACCORDING TO THE NEW DEPUTY 
FOREIGN MINISTER, CROATIA HAS A BRIEF WINDOW REMAINING FOR 
TOUGH DECISIONS; THE UPCOMING ELECTION SEASON WOULD SOON 
CLOSE THE DOOR ON UNPOPULAR ACTIONS BY THE GOC COALITION. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
IRAQ 
---- 
 
¶2.  (C) IN HIS INTRODUCTORY CALL ON NEWLY ARRIVED DEPUTY 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVAN SIMONOVIC (UNTIL RECENTLY CROATIA,S UN 
PERMREP) ON MARCH 3, AMBASSADOR ROSSIN ASKED FOR CROATIA'S 
SUPPORT AT THE UN FOR U.S. OBJECTIVES ON IRAQ.  SIMONOVIC 
SAID HE DID NOT FORESEE A MAJOR ROLE FOR CROATIA AND 
INDICATED HIS BELIEF THAT THE UNSC WOULD APPROVE A SECOND 
RESOLUTION, WHICH WAS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR PRESERVING THE 
RELEVANCE AND CREDIBILITY OF THE UN.  HE SPECULATED THAT IT 
WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO INSTALL TRUE DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ 
GIVEN THE ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS TENSIONS.  THE AMBASSADOR 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00489  01 OF 03  061511Z 
THANKED CROATIA FOR ITS RECENT DECISION TO PERMIT FLOW 
THROUGH OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CARRYING U.S. TROOPS TO THE 
REGION.  WHILE WE DID NOT NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AT THIS 
TIME, IT WAS POSSIBLE THE U.S. WOULD SEEK ADDITIONAL 
COOPERATION IN THE FUTURE TO SUPPORT OUR MILITARY OPERATIONS. 
 THE U.S. SOUGHT A CLOSE DIALOGUE WITH THE GOC ON THE IRAQ 
SITUATION. 
 
NATO AND CROATIA 
---------------- 
 
¶3.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED PROGRESS ON THE ADRIATIC CHARTER 
TEXT AND RECONFIRMED HIS ATTENDANCE AT THE MEETING OF THE 
THREE FOREIGN MINISTERS IN DUBROVNIK ON MARCH 7.  HE PRESSED 
FOR A STRONG STATEMENT ON IRAQ IN THE PLANNED DUBROVNIK 
DECLARATION.  REFERRING TO THE CROATIAN LANGUAGE ON 
INDIVIDUAL TRACKS INSERTED INTO THE DRAFT CHARTER, SIMONOVIC 
ADMITTED THAT CROATIA HAD BEEN RELUCTANT TO PURSUE REGIONAL 
COOPERATION FOR FEAR OF CUTTING INCREASINGLY CLOSE RELATIONS 
WITH WESTERN EUROPEAN STATES.  HOWEVER, HE ASSURED THE 
AMBASSADOR, WITH UNSUAL ANIMATION, THAT CROATIA WAS FULLY 
COMMITTED TO CLOSE COOPERATION WITH REGIONAL PARTNERS AND 
WOULD SEEK TO PROMOTE THE CANDIDACIES OF OTHER MAP COUNTRIES. 
 CROATIA WOULD PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE AT THE EU SUMMIT IN 
THESSALONIKI. 
 
¶4.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT SINCE CROATIA HAD A 
REPUTATION FOR WANTING TO GO ITS OWN WAY, GOC REPRESENTATIVES 
MUST SAY EXPLICITLY AND OFTEN THAT CROATIA SUPPORTS REGIONAL 
COOPERATION.  A COMPETITIVE APPROACH DENIGRATING OTHER 
ASPIRANTS AND INVITEES DOES NOT HELP CROATIA.  THE AMBASSADOR 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00489  01 OF 03  061511Z 
STRESSED THAT THE U.S. STRONGLY SUPPORTED CROATIA'S NATO 
ASPIRATIONS AND WOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE. 
HOWEVER, CROATIA NEEDED TO DO MORE ON DEFENSE REFORMS, ICTY 
COOPERATION, REFUGEE RETURNS, AND JUDICIAL REFORM.  CROATIA 
NEEDED TO PUT OUT A POSITIVE MESSAGE OF PROGRESS ON THESE 
ISSUES AND NOT BE SEEN AS COMBATIVE OR "WHINING" IN RESPONSE 
TO INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM. 
 
ICC ) ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT 
-------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT CROATIA 
WAS WAITING FOR AN EU MEMBER STATE MODEL ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT 
BEFORE MOVING AHEAD WITH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S. 
SIMONOVIC CONFIRMED THIS BUT ALSO ASKED THAT THE U.S. NOT 
PRESS TOO HARD FOR AN AGREEMENT, REFERRING TO THE SENSITIVITY 
OF AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT DUE TO PERCEIVED INEQUITIES IN THE 
PUBLIC,S MIND BETWEEN U.S. OBJECTIVES AND CROATIA,S ICTY 
OBLIGATIONS.  HOWEVER, HE CONFIRMED THAT CROATIA WOULD BE 
READY TO MOVE AHEAD ONCE THERE IS AN EU STATE MODEL 
AGREEMENT.  IN THAT REGARD, HE HOPED THE U.S. WOULD BE ABLE 
TO MAKE TIMELY PROGRESS ON SUCH A MODEL AGREEMENT.  THE 
AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER THE PROVISIONS 
AND DEADLINE  OF THE ASPA.  WE COULD NOT PREDICT HOW IT WOULD 
BE IMPLEMENTED BUT WAIVERS COULD NOT BE PRESUMED.  CROATIA 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

ICTY ISSUES 
----------- 
 
¶6.  (C) SIMONOVIC ADMITTED THAT THE GOC HAD HANDLED THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00489  02 OF 03  061511Z 
BOBETKO CASE BADLY, AT LEAST INITIALLY.  THE HAPHAZARDLY 
LAUNCED LEGAL APPROACH HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL, BUT LUCK (E.G., 
WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT) HAD PLAYED TOO LARGE A ROLE. 
BUT THAT CASE WAS NOW "MORE OR LESS" RESOLVED.  IT WAS CLEAR 
THAT CROATIA NEEDED A "SUCCESSFUL CASE" TO DEMONSTRATE ITS 
FULL COMMITMENT TO ITS ICTY OBLIGATIONS.  HE ADDED THAT 
INDICTMENTS AND THE POTENTIAL TRANSFER OF CROATIAN OFFICERS 
FOR COMMAND RESPONSIBILITY CHARGES DO NOT SIT WELL WITH THE 
CROATIAN PUBLIC.  HE HAD HEARD THAT THERE MAY BE UP TO FIVE 
ADDITIONAL INDICTMENTS OF CROATIAN CITIZENS BEING STUDIED BY 
THE ICTY. 
 
¶7.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR AGREED THAT THE BOBETKO CASE WAS NOW 
BEHIND US, BUT WARNED THAT BECAUSE OF GOC SHORTCOMINGS IN THE 
HANDLING OF THE BOBETKO INDICTMENT, THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY WOULD BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THE GOC,S 
PERFORMANCE ON ANY NEW INDICTMENTS.  THEY MUST BE HANDLED 
QUICKLY AND QUIETLY TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL COMPLIANCE.  IN 
ADDITION, THE U.S. AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY ARE LOOKING FOR MORE ACTIVE AND VIGOROUS GOC 
ACTIONS TO LOCATE AND CAPTURE ICTY INDICTEE GOTOVINA.  WE 
KNEW SPECIFICALLY OF THINGS THE GOC CLAIMED IT WAS DOING TO 
FIND GOTOVINA THAT, IN FACT, IT WAS NOT DOING. 
 
¶8.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR ADVISED SIMONOVIC THAT THE U.S. WAS 
PREPARING TO RE-LAUNCH ITS INITIATIVE TO ASSIST THE GOC WITH 
LOCAL WAR CRIMES PROSECUTIONS.  HE ANTICIPATED A U.S. 
PROPOSAL SOON FOR A U.S. TEAM TO VISIT IN APRIL OR MAY. 
SIMONOVIC WELCOMED THIS, REFERRING TO PROPOSED REFORMS IN THE 
JUDICIAL SECTOR AND PLANS TO ESTABLISH FOUR REGIONAL COURTS 
TO TRY WAR CRIMES CASES. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

UNCHR SESSION 
------------- 
 
9  (C) THE AMBASSADOR REMINDED SIMONOVIC THAT THE LINE UP IN 
THIS YEAR,S UNCHR SESSION WAS BAD, STARTING WITH LIBYA,S 
INSTALLATION AS CHAIRMAN.  THE U.S. WANTED TO WORK CLOSELY 
WITH CROATIA TO PROMOTE A PRODUCTIVE SESSION.  SIMONOVIC 
FULLY AGREED WITH THE AMBASSADOR,S POINTS, NOTING CROATIA'S 
BOARD PARTICIPATION THIS YEAR.  HE LAMENTED EXCESSIVE 
POLITIZATION IN THE FORUM. 
 
SFRY -- SUCCESSION ASSETS 
------------------------- 
 
¶10.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE U.S. INTENTION TO UNBLOCK 
SFRY NBY ASSETS LOCATED IN THE U.S.  HE NOTED THAT THE U.S. 
WAS STILL SEEKING A HOLD HARMLESS STATEMENT FROM THE GOC AND 
HOPED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD REVERSE ITS OPPOSITION.  HE 
WOULD RAISE THIS ISSUE WITH FM PICULA IN AN UPCOMING MEETING. 
 SIMONOVIC RESPONDED THAT CROATIA DID NOT WANT TO BE AN 
OBSTACLE TO THE U.S. INITIATIVE AND URGED THAT BOTH SIDES 
SEEK A SOLUTION SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.  HE POINTED OUT 
THAT A GOC DECISION TO ACCEDE TO THE U.S. REQUEST ON THIS 
ISSUE ) LIKE A NUMBER OF OTHER DIFFICULT ISSUES BEFORE THE 
GOC ) WOULD NOT SIT WELL WITH THE PUBLIC.  WITH ELECTIONS 
EXPECTED EITHER THIS FALL OR PERHAPS EARLY NEXT YEAR, THE GOC 
WOULD WANT TO MAKE THE UNPLEASANT DECISIONS BEFORE THE 
PRE-ELECTION WINDOW CLOSED IN ABOUT TWO MONTHS.  THE 
AMBASSADOR AGREED AND ADDED HIS HOPE THAT A GOC DECISION TO 
FOREGO $50 MILLION PLUS FROM THE NBY DISTRIBUTION WOULD NOT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

REFUGEE RETURNS 
--------------- 
 
¶11.  (C) THE AMBASSADOR NOTED OUR CONCERNS REGARDING REFUGEE 
RETURNS ARE ASSUMING STEADILY MORE PROMINENCE IN CROATIA'S 
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.  SIMONOVIC SAID THAT CROATIA MUST BE 
MUCH MORE PROACTIVE ON THIS ISSUE, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE REAL 
PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY WITH ADDRESSING THE TENANCY RIGHTS 
ISSUE.  ON THE TENANCY RIGHTS ISSUE, THE AMBASSADOR URGED 
THAT THE GOC PRIORITIZE ITS ACTIONS AND PUT PRIMARY FOCUS ON 
CASES WHERE ACTUAL REFORMS HINGE ON PROVIDING FARMER TENANTS 
A HOUSING OPTION.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE U.S. AND EU STATES HAD 
NOT SEEN MUCH MOVEMENT ON THIS FROM THE GOC SIDE. 
RECONSTRUCTION MINISTER CACIC HAD BEEN ENCOURAGING BUT VAGUE 
ON AN ISSUE WHERE CONCRETE STEPS ARE HUGELY OVERDUE.  PM 
RACAN HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTING ON THIS ISSUE. 
 
¶12.  (C) SIMONOVIC AGREED THAT THE GOC NEEDS TO ACT BUT THAT 
THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS WOULD LIMIT THE GOC'S MANEUVERING 
ROOM.  IN ANY EVENT, HE CLAIMED THAT CROATIAN PUBLIC OPINION 
IS NOW MUCH MORE FAVORABLE TOWARD THE RETURN OF CROATIAN 
SERBS.  IN FACT, HE ASSERTED, THE GOC HAS DONE FAR MORE THAN 
WAS THOUGHT POSSIBLE FIVE YEARS AGO.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶13.  (C) SIMONOVIC IMPRESSED US AS A BUSINESSLIKE 
PROFESSIONAL WITH WHOM WE CAN DO BUSINESS.  PRIOR BILLINGS 
FROM USUN OF A VERY LAWYERLIKE APPROACH WERE AMPLY BORNE OUT. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00489  03 OF 03  061511Z 
 HE MAY WELL PROVE TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN FORCING THE LEADEN 
MFA BUREAUCRACY TOWARD TIMELY ACTION AND REASONABLE POSITIONS 
THAT RESPOND TO CONCERNS COMING FROM THE U.S. AND OTHERS IN 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
 
¶14.  (C) HOWEVER, WE ARE CONCIOUS THAT HIS BACKGROUND AND 
PAST USG INTERACTIONS HAVE SUGGESTED A STRONG NATIONALIST 
STREAK UNDER THE URBANE SURFACE.  CERTAINLY, IN THE MEETING 
SIMONOVIC PUT THE MOST FAVORABLE SPIN ON EACH RESPONSE, 
HIGHLIGHTING CROATIA'S HANDICAPS AND "NEED FOR UNDERSTANDING" 
WHILE SEEKING TO PORTRAY HIMSELF AS A SYMPATHETIC FRIEND TO 
THE U.S. IN A SOMETIMES UNFRIENDLY COURT.  HIS OBSERVATIONS 
ABOUT THE VERY SHORT WINDOW AVAILABLE FOR THE GOC TO TAKE 
UNPOPULAR DECISIONS RANG TRUE, ALTHOUGH THIS COALITION 
GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS LED BY A PRIME MINISTER WHO SEEKS 
CONSENSUS AT ALL COSTS, HAS SHOWN LITTLE INCLINATION TO TAKE 
UNPOPULAR (EVEN IF NECESSARY) DECISIONS REGARDLESS OF THE 
TIMING.
