D). 
 
 
¶1. (C) AK MP Mahmut Kocak told pol counselor November 12 that 
he would lead a delegation to Pakistan November 13 to solicit 
the GOP's assistance in securing the release of Turkish 
national Hassan Ornal, who is being held hostage in 
Afghanistan by the Taliban.  Kocak said the plan is to use 
the governor's office in Ghazni province in Afghanistan and 
governor Sadullah's good offices to establish contact with 
the captors, invite their representatives into Pakistan for 
negotiations, give them a message from PM Erdogan asking for 
Ornal's release, and obtain Ornal's release within three 
days.  Kocak said he understands the US would object to any 
deal leading to the release of imprisoned Taliban.  He asked 
the US to weigh in with the Pakistani foreign minister and 
through Kabul with Governor Sadullah to help obtain Ornal's 
release. 
 
 
¶2. (C) Kocak said that PM Erdogan believes that bringing home 
a freed Turkish captive would redound immensely to AK's 
credit at a time when status quo elements in Turkey are 
attempting to grind the party and the GOT down.  Kocak also 
sees a successful mission as the way to gain him a cabinet 
seat in what is likely to be Erdogan's shuffle of half a 
dozen portfolios in a month or two. 
 
 
¶3. (C) MFA DDG for South Asian Affairs Aydin Evirgen (who 
said he did not know about the mission until hours before the 
delegation was to depart Ankara) separately confirmed that 
Kocak would travel to Pakistan and that he would be carrying 
a message from Erdogan.  Evirgen said Kocak also intends to 
seek a meeting with Pakistani Ministry of Interior officials. 
 Evirgen described the mission as "private effort" while 
adding that it had the PM's blessing and was part of the 
GOT's overall efforts to secure Ornal's release via peaceful 
means. 
 
 
¶4. (U) Dushanbe and Peshawar minimize considered.
