SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON CAFTA, JULY 18, 2003 
 
 
Â¶1. Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La Tribuna" on 
7/18 entitled "Overwhelming". "The Central American presidents 
agreed in their latest summit in Guatemala on a common position 
to move forward on the CAFTA negotiations, and to establish a 
common ground to start negotiations for a free trade agreement 
with the EU." 
 
"The Guatemalan President inaugurated the summit warning that the 
Central American integration `is a crucial step, and 
globalization will overwhelm us if we are divided'." 
 
"If we have advanced in this matter, we hope it happens likewise 
regarding other integration issues. This experience should teach 
us that we shouldn't wait to have a crisis that could have easily 
be avoided if the presidents had provided their political backing 
since the beginning of the negotiations."
