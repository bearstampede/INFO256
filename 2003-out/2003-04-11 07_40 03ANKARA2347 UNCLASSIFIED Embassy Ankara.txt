Summary 
------- 
 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: UNOCHA hosted an NGO/IO coordination meeting 
on 9 April in Ankara.  UNOCHA, UNHCR, IFRC, the American Red 
Cross, ten NGOs and DART Field Office/North attended.  UNHCR 
reported no refugee movements in the region.  As a result, 
the GOT Crisis Center and the Turkish Red Crescent Society 
(Kizilay) are scaling back their operations in southeastern 
Turkey.  UNSECOORD has received GOT permission, in principle, 
to enter northern Iraq from Turkey to conduct a security 
assessment.  There has been increased movement of WFP food 
shipments from Turkey to northern Iraq.  NGOs continue to 
await permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) 
to transit Turkey to work in northern Iraq.  Reports from 
northern Iraq indicate that food and non-food items are 
available but at increased costs.  Health care and other 
essential services continue to be provided.  End summary.

UN Update 
--------- 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) UNHCR deputy representative reported that there have 
been no major or minor refugee movements in the region, but 
that UNHCR remains in the preparedness mode.  The deputy 
representative noted that it was not until day 39 of the 1991 
war that refugee flows began.  He expressed ongoing concern 
for the situation, citing Kurdish movements toward Mosul and 
Kirkuk as possible triggers for large movements of Iraqis. 
 
 
¶3. (U) The lack of movement of refugees into Turkey has 
caused the GOT to re-evaluate its Silopi operation and move 
items to Diyarbakir.  The GOT is also reassessing the Crisis 
Center in Diyarbakir.  UNOCHA reported that the Center 
remains on standby with a scaled-down presence.  Kizilay has 
reduced its staff in southeastern Turkey by 160.  There are 
now 120 Kizilay staff members present in that region. 
 
 
¶4. (U) MFA has accepted, in principle, UNSECOORD,s request 
to transit Turkey to conduct a security assessment in 
northern Iraq.  Clearance is still needed from UN offices in 
New York and Larnaca, UNOCHA reported.  Two teams are 
prepared to begin the assessment in northern Iraq when these 
clearances are received. 
 
 
¶5. (U) Since 30 March more that 100 WFP-contracted trucks 
have transited into northern Iraq, carrying mostly wheat 
flour to Dohuk, Arbil and Sulaimaniyah.  UNJLC reported that 
an average of 250 trucks per day would be required to meet 
future plans. 
 
 
---------- 
NGO Issues 
---------- 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) Some NGOs remain on standby in Ankara awaiting MFA 
permission to transit Turkey to work in Iraq.  There has been 
no formal notification from the MFA.  Two NGO representatives 
will depart Turkey on 10 April; one will leave a local 
representative to monitor the MFA request. 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) ID cards and coordination inside of Iraq remain 
issues for NGOs.  NGOs do not want to use U.S. 
military-issued ID cards.  They recognize the importance of 
IDs but favor using their own organizations, cards.  NGOs 
are also concerned about coordination of humanitarian 
assistance inside Iraq.  They are unsure of how they will 
interact with the UN, the U.S. military and other 
coordinating bodies, e.g., ORHA. 
 
 
¶8. (U) Those NGOs remaining in Turkey are committed to 
working with the GOT to get formal permission to transit 
Turkey to work in Iraq.  Three NGOs: the American Refugee 
Committee, Shelter for Life and Counterpart International 
submitted requests for transit permits to the MFA during the 
week of 6 April.  Eight NGOs have now requested transit 
permits.

Northern Iraq Update 
-------------------- 
¶9. (U) UNOPS has completed an IDP survey in the 
Kurdish-controlled region of Iraq.  They report that there 
are now 266,000 displaced persons in the region. 
¶10. (U) UNOCHA reported that the old Iraqi dinar has 
appreciated by 40 percent.  Food costs are increasing by 
50-100 percent, but shops are open.  Non-food items remain 
available, but there is a shortage of shelter material.  This 
shortage could be problematic if there is an influx of IDPs. 
 
 
¶11. (U) Health services continue to function, and 
UN-sponsored vaccination programs, e.g., measles, are ongoing. 
 
 
¶12. (SBU) Fuel continues to be imported to Sulaimaniyah and 
Arbil from Iran.  There have been no shipments from 
GOI-controlled areas since the war began. 
 
 
¶13. (SBU) Power lines from Mosul to the Kurdish-controlled 
region of Iraq have been damaged in recent fighting.  Power 
continues to be supplied, but the cost of power has increased.

Further Meetings

¶14. (U) The next NGO/IO coordination meeting will be held at 
UN House in Ankara on 16 April at 1400 hrs.  DART Field 
Office/North will attend.
