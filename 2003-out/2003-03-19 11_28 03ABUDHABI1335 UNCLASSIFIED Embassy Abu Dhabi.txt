SUBJECT:  GETTING OUT THE WORD: PAS ABU DHABI LAUNCHES 
AGGRESSIVE IRAQ OUTREACH STRATEGY FOR THE UAE 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  DURING THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, PUBLIC AFFAIRS 
SECTION ABU DHABI LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSIVE PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
OUTREACH STRATEGY FOR THE CURRENT CRISIS WITH IRAQ, USING E-MAIL 
LIST-SERVES, CD-ROMS, AND OTHER IIP PRODUCTS TO GET OUT THE 
MESSAGE ON U.S. POLICIES TOWARD IRAQ AND OTHER KEY MIDDLE EAST 
ISSUES.  CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATIONS,  MEDIA, GOVERNMENT, AND 
ACADEMIC INTERLOCUTORS HAVE RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO THESE EFFORTS 
WITH FURTHER REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR MESSAGE ON IRAQ, PAS 
AND INFORMATION RESEARCH CENTER (IRC) STAFF PLANNED, DEVELOPED, 
AND IMPLEMENTED A WIDE RANGING OUTREACH STRATEGY TO SPREAD IIP 
AND PD MATERIALS ON IRAQ TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND KEY MEDIA, 
GOVERNMENT, AND ACADEMIC CONTACTS.  MAJOR SPEECHES, INTERVIEWS, 
AND POLICY STATEMENTS ARE DISTRIBUTED DAILY TO A SELECT LIST OF 
KEY CONTACTS.  PARTICULAR RECIPIENTS RECEIVE MORE SPECIALIZED IIP 
PRODUCTS, OFFICE OF GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS DOCUMENTS, AND 
WASHINGTON FILE STAFF ARTICLES BASED ON PROFESSIONAL OR PERSONAL 
INTERESTS. 
 
¶3.  GIVEN THE CONNECTIVITY OF EMIRATIS AND OTHER RESIDENTS OF THE 
UAE, DELIVERY METHODS FOCUS ON EMAIL, THE EMBASSY WEBSITE, FAX, 
AND CELLULAR TELEPHONE MESSAGING.  PAS CREATED A SEPARATE IRC 
EMAIL ACCOUNT TO DISSEMINATE MATERIALS QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY 
WHILE RECEIVING FEEDBACK AT THE SAME TIME.  RESPONSES ARE 
POSITIVE AND ENCOURAGING, PARTICULARLY FROM KEY CONTACTS AT ABU 
DHABI TV, THE EMIRATES NEWS AGENCY, AND THE UAE MINISTRY OF 
INFORMATION AND CULTURE. 
 
¶4.  FOR EXAMPLE:  THE "GULF NEWS", THE LEADING ENGLISH LANGUAGE 
NEWSPAPER IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, QUOTED EXTENSIVELY FROM 
IIP'S "IRAQ'S VOICES FOR FREEDOM" IN A 1300-WORD ARTICLE 
PUBLISHED FRIDAY, MARCH 14, 2003, AND ENTITLED "IRAQIS WANT 
DEMOCRACY TO SHAPE FUTURE" WITH SUBTITLE: "EXILES WANT A FREE AND 
INDEPENDENT STATE; SEE (THEIR) COUNTRY AS THE JAPAN OF MIDDLE 
EAST."  AUTHOR SHAZIA MALIK DIRECTLY QUOTED THE IRAQI EXILES 
FEATURED IN "IRAQ'S VOICES FOR FREEDOM" AND ATTRIBUTED IRC ABU 
DHABI FOR THE INFORMATION.  MS. MALIK SUBSEQUENTLY CONTACTED IRC 
STAFF FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE COSTS OF REBUILDING 
AFGHANISTAN.
