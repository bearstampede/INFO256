¶1. (U) Press reports on 3/27/03 confirm that efforts to 
extinguish fires burning in the Rumaila field in southern 
Iraq were abandoned on Tuesday, March 25, due to poor weather 
conditions, and added that joint efforts of the Kuwaiti Oil 
Company (KOC) firefighting team and U.S. contractor Boots and 
Coots were expected to resume today.  The leader of the KOC 
team, Aisa Bou Yabes, said that all fires could be doused 
within ten days to two weeks. 
 
2.(U) Separately, a spokesman for the Kuwait Petroleum 
Corporation (KPC) said that 17 oil wells in the Ratqa field 
in northern Kuwait had been reopened to produce 24,000 
barrels per day (bpd).  The spokesman, Sheikh Talal Al-Sabah, 
said the remaining 22 wells would be reopened "gradually." 
Sheikh Talal added that once the Ratqa field was fully on 
line, KPC would consider reopening the Abdali field, also 
shut in at the onset of the conflict.
