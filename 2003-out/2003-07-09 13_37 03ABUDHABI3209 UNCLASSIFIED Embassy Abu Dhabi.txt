SUBJECT: NUMBER OF UAE WOMEN DIPLOMATS ON THE RISE 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT: The UAE female diplomatic 
corps increased to 16 yesterday with the swearing in 
of 8 more women diplomats.  An initiative of MFA 
MinState Shaykh Hamdan, the MFA began accrediting 
women as diplomats, with the ability to serve in 
embassies overseas, in 2001.  The Ambassador has 
encouraged Hamdan to increase the number of women 
diplomats on a number of occasions, and we hope to see 
an even greater number sworn in next year.  We will 
support and encourage the development of women 
diplomats through training opportunities in the U.S. 
and participation in International Visitor programs 
when possible.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
¶2.  On 8 July, MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al 
Nahyan swore in this year's crop of new diplomats. 
Significantly, the class of 23 new diplomats contains 
eight women, including Sheikha Nejla Al-Qassimi, 
member of the Ras Al-Khaimah ruling family, MFA 
Americas Desk Officer and one of our primary working- 
level MFA contacts. 
 
¶3.  Al-Qassimi told Poloff on July 9 that the number 
of female UAE diplomats now stands at 16.  In 2001, 
the first two women diplomats were sworn in, and in 
2002, six more took the oath.  She noted that prior to 
2001, women worked in the MFA as staff members but 
were not allowed to be diplomats because they were 
women.  For example, two of the women sworn in last 
year -- and attending UNGA this fall -- had been 
working in the MFA Administrative Affairs Department 
as staff, although they functioned as diplomats, for 
six or seven years.  Al-Qassimi commented that the 
initiative to accredit women as diplomats is being 
pushed by Hamdan and is supported strongly by his 
mother, UAE First Lady Shaykha Fatima Bint Mubarak. 
 
¶4.  In August, an 11-member working-level MFA 
delegation, four of them women, will attend the UN 
General Assembly.  Al-Qassimi stated that the MFA 
endeavors to send junior diplomats to UNGA to gain 
experience -- both in the U.S. and in diplomacy.  This 
will be the first visit to the U.S. for many of the 
junior diplomats attending UNGA this year.  Upon 
arrival in New York, the working-level delegation will 
attend a two-week course on the UN, then assist the 
UAE Permanent Representative by sitting in on 
committee meetings, taking notes, and giving daily 
briefings.
