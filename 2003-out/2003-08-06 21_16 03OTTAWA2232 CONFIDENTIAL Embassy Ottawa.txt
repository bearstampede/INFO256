SUBJECT: URGING HIGH-LEVEL CANADIAN ENGAGEMENT ON MOLDOVA 
 
REF: STATE 223920 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Canada agrees with us that more pressure needs to be 
brought to bear on the Moldovan peace process and the 
withdrawal of Russian forces, and will seek opportunities to 
do so.  Embassy Political Minister Counselor discussed reftel 
demarche with Norbert Kalisch, Acting Assistant Deputy 
Minister for Europe and the most senior official available at 
Foreign Affairs.  Kalisch said that Canadian Deputy FM Peter 
Harder may be visiting Moscow in October, and that he could 
raise it at that time with DFM Trubnikov. 
 
¶2. (C) Kalisch noted that during a Trubnikov visit to Ottawa 
in 2002, Canada had suggested that Moldova/Transnistria be 
one of the topics for discussion with POLDIR Jim Wright, but 
that Russia vetoed the suggestion.  Kalisch said that a 
Harder visit would be a good opportunity to press on this 
issue, and that the GoC would look for opportunities to raise 
other relevant parties as well.
