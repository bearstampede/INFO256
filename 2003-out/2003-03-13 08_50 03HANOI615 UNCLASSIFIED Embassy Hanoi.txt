¶1.  (U)  In a meeting with Charge on March 13, Assistant 
Foreign Minister Nguyen Duc Hung, concurrently Director of 
the MFA's America's Department, said that the GVN had taken 
prompt action on all USG requests for name checks on 
potential terrorist links since 9/11, including reviewing 
information for potential terrorist financial assets that 
might have made their way into Vietnam's banking system and 
checking immigration records.  AFM Hung reported that the 
Ministries of Public Security and Finance as well as the 
State Bank performed the checks and that each of the 
concerned GVN agencies had reported to the MFA that all 
checks proved negative. 
 
¶2.  (U)  AFM Hung emphasized to Charge that the GVN is 
determined to "cooperate fully with the United States" and 
would make sure that no terrorist is issued a visa.   He 
noted that, concerning counterterrorism, "your goal is our 
goal."  He pledged that Vietnam would continue to respond to 
all such future requests for cooperation.  PORTER
