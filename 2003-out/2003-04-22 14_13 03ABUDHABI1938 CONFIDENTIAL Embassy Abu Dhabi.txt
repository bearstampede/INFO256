SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: NEXT STEPS FOR UAE FIELD HOSPITAL 
DEPLOYMENT 
 
REFS: ABU DHABI 1931 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: The UAEG has decided to support an 
existing medical facility in Baghdad - the Olympic 
Hospital -- instead of deploying a stand-alone field 
hospital.  A UAE delegation, accompanied by USLO 
representative, traveled to Baghdad on 4/21 to assess 
the health needs of the city and selected the hospital 
that UAE medical staff will renovate, equip, supply, 
and operate.  The delegation plans to open the 
hospital for outpatient care within the next 48 hours, 
and for longer-term inpatient and surgical care within 
one to two weeks.  The UAEG has put the highest 
priority on the provision of this assistance to the 
Iraqi people and -- despite allegations that there's 
no shortage of medical supplies in Baghdad -- the UAE 
medical team perceived that the Baghdad health sector 
is not functioning (the delegation was besieged by 
locals in the streets requiring urgent medical care). 
We expect that the Emiratis will leave behind all 
equipment and medical supplies once the Iraqi health 
system is back up-and-running.  Post very much 
appreciates the support we have received from CENTCOM 
in making this important initiative happen.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) Acting upon instructions from the Office of 
UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff Shaykh Muhammed bin 
Zayid Al-Nahyan, a delegation of UAE military 
personnel (accompanied by USLO representative) 
traveled to Baghdad 4/21 to conduct a site assessment 
survey for the UAEG's proposed field hospital 
(reftel).  Based on their observations and discussions 
with Iraqis with whom they met, the delegates (which 
included a number of UAE military doctors) decided 
that Iraq would benefit more in the long-run if UAE 
medical personnel refurbished and temporarily occupied 
an existing Iraqi hospital. 
 
¶3.  (C) The UAE delegation selected the Olympic 
Hospital, based on its central location in Baghdad and 
the building's sound infrastructure.  The hospital is 
located between the Ministry of Health and Ministry of 
Trade buildings, and is only a few blocks from the 
Palestinian Hotel.  It is rumored that the Olympic 
Hospital formerly was the private medical facility of 
Saddam Hussein's son, Uday.  The Olympic Hospital, 
although intact, has been completely gutted and 
stripped of its equipment by looters -- the hospital's 
MRI machine was dragged into the alley and destroyed. 
 
¶4.  (C) The UAE delegation tasked the UAE Embassy in 
Baghdad to hire contractors to begin cleaning the 
building immediately, and to oversee the complete 
renovation of the hospital.  The facility will need a 
great deal of general cleaning and glass repair, and 
the contractors will build a fence around the back of 
the hospital and to begin construction on housing for 
the Emirati medical staff.  The UAE delegation also 
hired armed guards to protect the building from 
further looting.  The UAE Embassy in Baghdad plans to 
have a portion of the building ready for outpatient 
services within the next 48 hours. 
 
¶5.  (C) Post will continue to coordinate the shipment 
of UAE medical and administrative staff and equipment 
to Baghdad as soon as possible.  USLO expects CENTCOM 
to approve an airlift of an initial seven core UAE 
medical personnel and basic supplies directly to 
Baghdad within the next 48 hours.
