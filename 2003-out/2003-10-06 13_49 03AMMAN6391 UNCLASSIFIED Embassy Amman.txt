STATE PLEASE PASS TO USPTO/OIR - MINNA MOEZIE 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON KIPR OTRA
SUBJECT: USPTO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING - JORDAN 
 
REF: STATE 278001 
 
¶1.  Embassy nominates two Jordanian government officials to 
participate in the USPTO Visiting Scholars Program.  The 
Embassy USAID mission plans to provide travel and per diem 
assistance for these candidates. 
 
¶2.  Post nominates: 
 
Ms. Zein Al-Awamaleh, 
Director 
Office of International Industrial Production and Protection 
Ministry of Industry and Trade 
 
Mr. Hamed Abadi 
Deputy Director 
National Library of Jordan 
Ministry of Culture 
 
The National Library has responsibility for enforcement of 
intellectual property laws and regulations in Jordan through 
an active enforcement unit. 
 
We have shared the detailed program with the ministries 
concerned and believe that these two candidates will benefit 
from the USPTO program.  Although the USPTO Visiting Scholars 
Program has a wider purpose, Embassy believes that support 
for these Jordanian candidates will also help the GOJ meet 
its IP commitments under the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade 
Agreement. 
 
¶3. Post will fax to the NEA/ARN desk a more detailed program 
registration form for each candidate as we receive all of the 
necessary details.  We look forward to hearing from 
Department regarding selection of nominees.
