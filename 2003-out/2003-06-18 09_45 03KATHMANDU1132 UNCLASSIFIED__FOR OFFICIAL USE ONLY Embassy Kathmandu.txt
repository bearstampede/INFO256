SUBJECT: NEPAL: GON RELEASES TIBETAN REFUGEE FROM 
DETENTION 
 
REF: (A) KATHMANDU 1074 (B) KATHAMNDU 1044 
 
¶1. (SBU) ON JUNE 17, NEPAL'S DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION 
RELEASED A MALE TIBETAN REFUGEE INTO UNHCR'S CUSTODY 
TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AFTER THE OFFICE OF TIBET PAID HIS FINE 
OF 7,500 RUPEES (APPROXIMATELY 98 USD).  THE DEPARTMENT OF 
IMMIGRATION HAD DETAINED THE MAN IN LATE APRIL, SHORTLY 
AFTER THE DETENTION OF THE 18 REFUGEES DEPORTED ON MAY 31 
(REF A).  THE OFFICE OF TIBET REPORTED THAT THE TIBETAN 
MAN HAD SOMEHOW BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE LARGER GROUP IN 
TRANSIT, AND SUBSEQUENTLY HAD NOT BEEN INCLUDED WITH THAT 
GROUP DURING THE DEPORTATION. [NOTE. NINE TIBETAN REFUGEES 
REMAIN IN DETENTION (DATING FROM JUNE 2000 TO MAY 2002) 
WITH HEAVY FINES RANGING FROM USD 1,600 TO USD 10,000. 
END NOTE.] 
 
¶2. (SBU) UNHCR REPORTS THAT ON JUNE 19 IT WILL SUBMIT A 
REQUEST TO THE DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION FOR EXIT PERMITS 
FOR A NEW GROUP OF 40 TIBETAN REFUGEES.  (ONE GROUP OF 40 
TIBETANS WAS GRANTED EXIT PERMITS JUNE 13 AND DEPARTED THE 
SAME DAY ON A BUS TO NEW DELHI.)  UNHCR GENEVA REPORTEDLY 
IS DELIBERATING ON WHETHER TO INCLUDE THE NAMES OF THE 
THREE CHILDREN WHO WERE MEMBERS OF THE ORIGINAL GROUP OF 
21 REFUGEES (REF B). 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT:  THE GON IS ANXIOUS TO REESTABLISH ITS 
CREDENTIALS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SINCE THE MAY 
31 DEPORTATION OF 18 TIBETAN REFUGEES.  FOLLOWING GON 
PROMISES THAT ITS POLICY TOWARD TIBETAN REFUGEES HAD NOT 
CHANGED (REFTELS), THE JUNE 17 RELEASE OF THE TIBETAN 
REFUGEE IS A PROMISING FIRST STEP TOWARDS DEMONSTRATING 
THIS COMMITMENT.  POST WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK THE STATUS 
OF THE THREE REFUGEE CHILDREN AS FURTHER PROOF THAT GON 
POLICY DOES NOT SUPPORT FURTHER DEPORTATIONS.  END 
COMMENT.
