  ¶1.   Under headline "Pretoria becomes chief stumbling 
      block", the independent daily "The Daily News" dedicated 
      its June 24 editorial to encouraging South African 
      President Thabo Mbeki to stop obstructing international 
      efforts meant to resolve the deepening political and 
      socioeconomic crisis in Zimbabwe.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   "After years of refusing to act on Zimbabwe's 
      deepening political and economic crisis, the South African 
      government is increasingly showing where its loyalties lie: 
      with the Harare government.  At almost every international 
      forum where the crisis is debated and solutions to it are 
      sought, it is none other than Pretoria which always comes 
      forward to blunt international pressure for the tough 
      action to be taken against a rogue government that has 
      rightly become a pariah in the world. . .While we accept 
      that it is South Africa's right to chart a foreign policy 
      of its choice, it is unacceptable that Pretoria should, on 
      one hand, refuse to act against naked and widening 
      injustices while, on the other hand, it also undermines 
      every effort by others who want to end the madness. . .If 
      Mbeki wants to be taken seriously by anyone on NEPAD, he 
      must begin to show resolute and impartial action in 
      resolving a long-festering problem right on his doorstep, 
      or simply let those who have the wherewithal to get on top 
      of an intolerable situation that is worsening by the hour. 
      . .Mbeki must decide. . .whether he is for or against the 
      struggle for democracy by the people of Zimbabwe.  In any 
      struggle against tyranny and dictatorship, there should 
      never be fence-sitters, and Mbeki would do well to decide 
      where he 
      belongs. . . ."
