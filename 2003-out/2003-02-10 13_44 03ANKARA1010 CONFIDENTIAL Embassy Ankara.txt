SUBJECT: TURKISH P.M. GUL TO SEND PRESIDENT BUSH MESSAGE 
EXPRESSING CONCERN ABOUT FEB. 18 VOTE TO ALLOW US TROOPS 
 
 
(U) Classified by Ambassador W. R. Pearson. Reason: 1.5 (b,d) 
 
 
¶1. (C) In a Feb. 10 meeting with Ambassador, Turkish Daily 
News editor Ilnur Cevik said that P.M. Gul plans to send a 
letter to President Bush today.  According to Cevik, Gul is 
deeply concerned that the USG does not understand that the 
economic aid package must be completed in its entirety before 
the Feb. 18 Parliamentary vote on allowing US troops here. 
Gul fears, per Cevik, that M.P.s will have a harder time 
voting in favor of allowing US troops after spending the 
current week-long national holiday with their constituents. 
The USG, Cevik said, does not realize the extent of 
"vehemence" in Parliament. 
 
 
¶2. (C) According to Cevik, Gul is prepared to go to 
Washington as early as this week to discuss the outstanding 
issues.  Cevik recommended privately to Gul to convey a 
message to the President along the lines of "help me to help 
you."
