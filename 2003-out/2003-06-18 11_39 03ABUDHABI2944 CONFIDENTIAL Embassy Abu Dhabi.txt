¶1.  (U) Classified by Acting DCM Thomas E. Williams for 
reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (U) This message contains an action request.  Please 
see paragraph 4. 
 
¶3.  (C) Post delivered 6/15 ref A talking points and 
background paper to the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
and faxed a courtesy copy to Central Bank FIU Chief 
Abdulrahim Al-Awadi.  Post received 6/17 a diplomatic note 
from the MFA requesting official copies in Arabic of all 
designation lists, from ref B designation of "Batasuna And 
The Basque Fatherland And Liberty" onward. 
 
¶4.  (C) Action request: As a matter of protocol, the 
Central Bank in recent months has encouraged us to submit 
terrorist financing designations directly to the MFA. 
Consequently, it not unusual that the MFA would require an 
official translation of the designation list, as the 
majority of our written communication with the MFA is in 
Arabic.  Although Post has limited translation 
capabilities, we will endeavor to provide a translation of 
these demarches and plan to note to the MFA that Post's 
transliterations of the names of designated individuals and 
entities should not be viewed as authoritative.  We will 
defer to the MFA and the UAE Central Bank to determine the 
alternate spelling of these names consistent with the 
UAEG's computerized lists of bank accounts.  Department 
please advise.  End action request.
