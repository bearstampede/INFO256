SUBJECT: DUTCH REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT LIBYA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 282619 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Mary E. Daly reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) The GoNL remains concerned about any increase in EU 
interactions with Libya.  The lifting of UN sanctions has not 
altered the lack of Dutch willingness to engage the with the 
Libyan government.  PolOff delivered reftel to Mirande 
Mulder, MFA Libya desk officer.  Mulder noted that the GoNL 
shares U.S. concerns over Libya's WMD programs, and does not 
favor increased political or economic ties with Libya. 
Simply, the Dutch do not trust Ghadaffi and do not see any 
tangible benefit in increased cooperation and trade.   Mudler 
stated the GoNL continues to voice concerns regarding 
increased ties at EU meetings, "often the only country that 
does." 
 
¶2.  (C) Mulder stated that the Italians and Spaniards are the 
strongest forces within the EU pushing for increased 
cooperation with Libya.  For example, Mulder said that the 
Italians want to allow the sale of EU weapons.  The GoNL 
opposes such a measure.  However, noting with concern the 
illegal migration to the EU/Italy via Libya, Mulder confirmed 
that the GoNL would favor EU cooperation with Libya in this 
area, provided that it is strictly for technical programs. 
Nevertheless, the Dutch harbor serious concerns regarding 
these programs as well.  Mulder stated that unless Libyan 
visa regulations are changed, the illegal flow will continue, 
and "any attempt at cooperation will be useless."
