SUBJECT: CROATIA SUPPORTS DELAY ON HUMAN CLONING RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 308654 
 
ON NOVEMBER 5 WE DELIVERED REFTEL POINTS AND DIPLOMATIC NOTE 
TO DUBRAVKA SIMONOVIC, MFA DEPARTMENT HEAD FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. 
SIMONOVIC, A LOCALLY RECOGNIZED EXPERT, HAS A DOCTORATE IN 
    BIO-MEDICAL ETHICS AND SERVES ON THE GOC COMMISSION FOR THE 
SAME.  SHE TOLD US CROATIA IS FIRMLY AGAINST HUMAN CLONING. 
PARLIAMENT HAS RATIFIED THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE PROTOCOL ON THE 
PROHIBITION OF HUMAN CLONING UNDER THE CONVENTION ON 
BIO-MEDICAL ETHICS.  HOWEVER, CROATIA WILL SUPPORT A DELAYING 
ACTION, EITHER A VOTE ON NO-ACTION OR A MOTION TO DEFER, IN 
ORDER TO GAIN TIME TO BUILD A CONSENSUS POSITION.  CROATIA 
BELIEVES THERE IS A NARROWING OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 
COSTA RICAN AND BELGIUM RESOLUTIONS, AND THAT NOW MAY NOT BE 
THE BEST TIME FOR THE UN TO TAKE UP THIS ISSUE.
