¶1.   SUMMARY: THE SIXTY-FOURTH SESSION OF THE U.N. FOOD 
AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE ON COMMODITY 
PROBLEMS (CCP) MET MARCH 18-22, 2O03 AT FAO HEADQUARTERS 
IN ROME.  MOST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND CAIRNS GROUP 
MEMBERS SAW THE MEETING AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT 
THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF DCVELOPED COUNTRY MARKET ACCESS 
BARRIERS AND TRADE-DISTORTING DOMESTIC SUPPORT ON 
DEVELOPING COUNTRY AGRICULTURE.  CAIRNS GROUP COUNTRIES 
AND THE EU ALSO CRITICIZED USE OF FOOD AID DURING 
DISCUSSION OF REPORTING OF FOOD AID TRANSACTIONS.  U.S. 
DEL DEFENDED U.S. FOOD AID, PARTICULARLY IN THE FACE OF 
WIDESPREAD FOOD EMERGENCIES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, AND 
SOUGHT TO BROADEN THE DEBATE TO RCFLECT THE POSITIVE 
IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL TRADE GENERALLY.  CHANGES IN THE 
FINAL REPORT SOUGHT BY THE UNITED STATES TO THIS EFFECT 
WERE NOT SUPPORTED BY THE COMMITTEE, AND THE UNITED 
STATES DISASSOCIATED FROM THE CONSENSUS ADOPTION OF THE 
REPORT.  THE COMMITTEE DID AGREE TO A KOREAN PROPOSAL TO 
CONSIDER REFORM AND SHORTENING OF THE CCP.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.   THE U.S. DELEGATION TO THE CCP CONSISTED OF: 
REPRESENTATIVE ELIZABETH BCRRY, DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR 
ANALYSIS, GRAIN AND FEED DIVISION, COMMODITY AND 
MARKETING PROGRAMS, FAS; ALTERNATE REPRESENTATIVE SARA 
SCHWARTZ, INTERNATIONAL TRADE SPECIALIST, WORLD TRADE 
ORGANIZATION AND MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS DIVISION, 
INTERNATIONAL TRADE POLICY, PAS; ADVISOR LUCY TAMLYN, 
ALTERNATE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE, U.S. MISSION; AND

¶3.   MR. ELHAMY ABDEL MOHAMMED MENAAM (EGYPT) WAS 
ELECTED CHAIR OF THE MEETING.  MR. ADIRAAN PRIJLINK 
(NETHERLANDS) WAS ELECTED FIRST VICE CHAIR, AND MR. 
CARLOS POZZO (VCNZUELA) WAS ELECTED SECOND VICE CHAIR. 
THE DRAFTING GROUP WAS COMPOSED OF AUSTRIA (CHAIR), 
CANADA (REPRESENTING NORTH AMERICA), FRANCE, GUATEMALA, 
INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, MAURITANIA, NEW ZEALAND, OMAN, 
QATAR, REPUBLIC OF KOREA, ROMANIA, AND SOUTH AFRICA. 
THE SUBSTANTIVE AGENDA ITEMS WERE: STATE OF WORLD 
AGRICULTURAL MARKETS; MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR WORLD 
AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY MARKETS; POLICY DEVELOPMENTS 
AFFECTING AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY MARKETS AND TRADE; AND 
INTERNATIONAL ACTION ON AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES AND 
TRADE. 
 
¶4.   AGENDA ITEM 3 - STATE OF WORLD AGRICULTURAL MARKETS 
(CCP 03/7).  THE U.S. INTERVENTION HIGHLIGHTED FACTUAL 
ERRORS IN THE SECTION ON BIOTECHNOLOGY.  THE UNITED 
STATES SUGGESTED THAT THE FAO FOCUS FUTURE WORK ON 
ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THE EU'S TRACEABILITY 
REGULATIONS ON DEVELOPING COUNTRY EXPORTS INSTEAD OF 
FOCUSSING ON "BALANCING CONSUMER CONCERNS WITH 
DEVELOPING COUNTRY NEEDS", AS SUGGESTED IN THE PAPER. 
 
¶5.   MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION AFTER THE U.S. INTERVENTION 
FOCUSSED ON BIOTECHNOLOGY.  THE EU EMPHASISED THAT IT 
DOES NOT BAN BIOTECH PRODUCTS, HAVING APPROVED 18 EVENTS 
SINCE 1991.  SEVERAL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES CALLED FOR PAO 
TO ENGAGE IN MORE CAPACITY BUILDING EFFORTS SO THAT 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES CAN GET THE FACTS ON BIOTECHNOLOGY 
VERSUS PROPAGANDA FROM DIVERGENT SOURCES.  OTHERS WANTED

PAGE 04        ROME  01662  01 OF 04  171534Z 
HELP TO DEVELOP THEIR ABILITY TO DO RISK ASSESSMENTS. 
 
¶6.   SEVERAL COUNTRIES (AUSTRALIA AND THE EU) TALKED 
ABOUT THEIR WTO POSITIONS, WITH THE EU HIGHLIGHTING 
THEIR "EVERYTHING BUT ARMS" AGREEMENT.  THAILAND, 
SURPRISINGLY, RATHCR THAN VOICING ITS CAIRNS GROUP 
POSITION IN THE WTO, CALLED FOR THE FAO TO INITIATE A 
STUDY ON HOW TO STABILIZE COMMODITY PRICES, SPECIFICALLY 
CITING THE RUBBER CARTEL AS A MODEL. 
 
¶7.   SEVERAL COUNTRIES (B 
RAZIL AND CANADA) SAID THE 
PAPER MIXED UP THE DISCUSSION OF FOOD SAFETY AND FOOD 
QUALITY ISSUES.  CANADA SAID THAT CONSUMER CONCERNS GO 
BEYOND FOOD SAFETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT AS STATED IN THE 
PAPER.  CANADA SUGGESTED THAT FAO FOCUS FUTURE WORK ON 
ANALYSING THE IMPACT ON DEVELOPING COUNTRY EXPORTS WHEN 
COUNTRIES IMPOSE NON-HEALTH RELATED REQUIREMENTS 
REGARDING PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES, GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS, 
AND ANIMAL WELFARE. 
 
¶8.   AGENDA ITEM 5 - AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS - RECENT 
EVOLUTION AND CONSTRAINTS ON GROWTH (CCP 03/9).  MUCH OF 
THE DISCUSSION FOCUSSED ON COUNTRIES' WTO POSITIONS AND 
 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

INTERVENTION FOCUSSED ON THE NEED FOR ALL COUNTRIES, 
INCLUDING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, TO LOWER TARIFFS.  NO 
OTHER COUNTRY SUPPORTED THIS POSITION.  SLOVAKIA 
GENERALLY SUPPORTED THE U.S. POSITION BUT WANTED SPECIAL 
PROVISIONS IN THE WTO FOR COUNTRIES IN TRANSITION. 
 
¶9.   SEVERAL COUNTRIES REITERATED THEIR WTO PROPOSALS, 
CLAIMING THAT WHATEVER WAS IN THE PROPOSAL WAS 
BENEFICIAL TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  JAPAN AND THE EU 
SUPPORTED THE IDEA THAT LOWER TARIFFS, INCLUDING THOSE 
PROPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES IN THE WTO WOULD HURT 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  AUSTRALIA CALLED FOR JAPAN AND 
THE EU TO BE MORE AMBITIOUS IN THE WTO AGRICULTURE 
NEGOTIATIONS.  AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, MALAYSIA, SOUTH AFRICA 
AND OTHER CAIRNS MEMBERS SUPPORTED THE PAPER'S PREMISE 
THAT DOMESTIC SUPPORT AND HIGH TARIFFS IN DEVELOPED 
COUNTRIES WERE THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF LIMITED MARKET 
ACCESS AND LOW COMMODITY PRICES.  SEVERAL OF THESE 
COUNTRIES SUPPORTED THE PAPER'S VIEW THAT TARIFF PEAKS 
AND ESCALATION PRESENTED SERIOUS CHALLENGES TO 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' ABILITY TO EXPORT PROCESSED 
PRODUCTS.  THE EU EMPHASIZED THE BENEFITS OF 
PREFERENTIAL TRADING AGREEMENTS.  INDONESIA WANTED TO 
SEE THE WTO EXCLUDE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FROM ANY TARIFF 
REDUCTIONS IN ORDER TO PROTECT DOMESTIC PRODUCERS. 
 
¶10.   BRAZIL PROPOSED THAT THE COMMITTEE DO A 
COMPARATIVE STUDY OF "WINNERS AND LOSERS"  UNDER THE 
CURRENT TRADING REGIME, NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF TRADE BUT 
ALSO FOREIGN DIRCCT INVESTMENTS.  ARGENTINA ALSO CALLED 
FOR MORE FAO FUNDING FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01662  02 OF 04  171535Z 
PARTICIPATE IN THE CODEX ALIMENTARIUS COMMISSION AND THE 
INTERIM COMMISSION ON PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES.  TECHNICAL 
ASSISTANCE WAS NEEDED NOT ONLY TO HELP DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES MEET STANDARDS SET BY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, BUT 
ALSO TO HELP SET STANDARDS FOR IMPORTING DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES.  CANADA SUGGESTED THAT FAO ANALYSE THE IMPACT 
OF STANDARDS BEING SET BY FOOD RETAILERS ON DEVELOPING 
COUNTRY PRODUCERS AND EXPORTS.  NIGERIA SUPPORTED 
CANADA'S SUGGESTION. 
 
¶11.   AGENDA ITEM 5B- SOME TRADE POLICY ISSUES RELATING 
TO TRENDS IN AGRICULTURAL IMPORTS IN THE CONTEXT OF FOOD 
SECURITY (CCP 03/10).  THE THRUST OF THE SECRETARIAT'S 
PAPER WAS TO POINT OUT AN INCREASE IN IMPORT SURGES 
(BROADLY DEFINED AS A 20 PERCENT INCREASE OVER THE 5- 
YEAR TREND), PARTICULARLY SINCE URUGUAY ROUND 
IMPLEMENTATION, AND TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF SUCH SURGES 
ON THE FOOD SECURITY OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  THIS 
ASSESSMENT WAS MADE BY COMPARING IMPORT TRENDS TO 
PRODUCTION TRENDS.  WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IMPORT 
SURGES COULD HAVE EITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE 
CONSEQUENCES FOR FOOD SECURITY, THE PAPER MAINLY 
FOCUSSED ON NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR LOW-INCOME FOOD 
DEFICIT COUNTRIES (LIFDCS), I.E. PRODUCTION IMPACT, 
INABILITY TO FINANCE SUCH IMPORTS.  IN PRESENTING THIS 
PAPER, THE FAO SECRETARIAT POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS A 
PROPOSAL FOR THE DOHA ROUND THAT RECOMMENDS A 
STREAMLINED SAFEGUARD PROCEDURE FOR DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES. 
 
¶12.   THE U.S. INTERVENTION EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01662  02 OF 04  171535Z 
PAPER WAS MISLEADING IN THAT MOST OF THE COUNTRIES 
HIGHLIGHTED IN "CASE STUDIES" CITED THEREIN WERE NOT 
SUBJECT TO UR MINIMUM ACCESS DISCIPLINES, PER PARA 2 IN 
ARTICLE 15 OF THE AGREEMENT ON AGRICULTURE.  A LIST OF 
THE 30 EXCLUDED COUNTRIES WAS SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD. 
MOREOVER, THE U.S. DEL POINTED OUT THA 
T THE PAPER'S MAIN 
PREMISE, THAT FOOD SECURITY COULD BE ENHANCED BY RAISING 
IMPORT BARRIERS, RAN COUNTER TO THE BODY OF RESEARCH 
CONDUCTED BY INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE 
FAO ITSELF.  FINALLY, THE U.S. DEL SUGGESTED THAT THE 
FAO FINE TUNE ITS RESEARCH IN THIS AREA SO THAT IT COULD 
EFFECTIVELY HELP LIFDCS IN TARGETED COUNTRIES ADJUST TO 
BOTH THE CHALLENGES AND THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE WORLD'S 
MORE OPEN TRADING ENVIRONMENT. 
 
¶13.   THE AUSTRALIAN DEL ASSERTED THAT IMPORT SURGES 
WERE DUE TO PRODUCTION SUBSIDIES IN THE EU, U.S. AND 
JAPAN; AND THAT SUBSIDIES IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
"INAPPROPRIATE FOOD AID" DISTORTED WORLD AGRICULTURAL 
MARKETS TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF LDCS (LEAST DEVELOPED 
COUNTRIES).  HE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE PAPERS 
SEEMING ENCOURAGEMENT OF LDCS TO INCREASE THE USE OF

SAFEGUARD MEASURES.  THE CANADIAN DEL ECHOED AUSTRALIAN 
AND U.S. CONCERN ABOUT SAFEGUARDS AND, LIKE THE U.S., 
ENCOURAGED THE SECRETARIAT TO FINE TUNE ITS ANALYSIS OF 
IMPORT SURGES AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE. 
 
¶14.   THE JAPANESE, EU AND SOUTH KOREAN DELS UNDERSCORED 
THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFEGUARD MEASURES, WITH JAPAN 
PROPOSING THAT THE LEGITIMATE USE OF SUCH MEASURES BE 
EXPANDED IN THE WTO.  THC EU ENCOURAGED THE FAO TO SHARE 
ITS PAPER WITH THE WTO AND WENT ON TO ASSERT THAT 
SPECIAL SAFEGUARDS FOR LDCS SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO 
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.  THE EU ALSO ENCOURAGED THE FAO TO 
PROVIDE INSTITUTIONAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTRIES THAT MIGHT 
NEED TO MAKE USE OF EXISTING SAFEGUARDS.  KOREA ASSERTED 
THAT IMPORT SURGES HAVE HURT ITS FOOD SECURITY. 
 
¶15.   AGENDA ITEM 6 - INTERNATIONAL ACTION ON 
AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES AND TRADE.  INCLUDED IN THIS 
ITEM WAS FOOD AID (CCP 03/2).  THE FAO SECRETARIAT 
PRESENTED A PAPER THAT LARGELY FOCUSSED ON DONOR 
COUNTRIES' REPORTING OBLIGATIONS AND A SIGNIFICANT DROP 
IN THE VOLUME OF FOOD AID TRANSACTIONS BEING NOTIFIED TO 
THE COMMITTEE ON SURPLUS STOCKS DISPOSAL (CSSD) IN 2000 
AND 2001.  ISSUES RAISED BY MEMBER COUNTRIES IN THE 
SEPTEMBER 2002 CSSD MEETING WERE ALSO SUMMARIZED IN THE 
REPORT. 
 
¶16.   THE AUSTRALIAN DELEGATE CONDEMNED THE U.S. 
GOVERNMCNT'S USE OF FOOD AID, ASSERTING THAT IT IS TRADE 
DISTORTING, A 100 PERCENT SUBSIDY AND PRIMARILY A 
SURPLUS DISPOSAL MECHANISM.  HE ALSO UNDERSCORED THAT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01662  03 OF 04  171535Z 
DISTRIBUTION VIA PRIVATE VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS (PVOS) 
SHOULD NOT BE USED TO AVOID POOD AID CONVENTION 
OBLIGATIONS.  HE PROPOSED THAT FOOD AID DONATIONS BE 
MADE SOLELY IN CASH, WHEREBY THE DONOR COUNTRY WOULD 
PURCHASE COMMODITIES FROM AN LDC OR EVEN A DIFFERENT 
REGION OF THE RECIPIENT COUNTRY, AND THAT THE DONATION 
BE FULLY A GRANT, NOT A CONCESSION LOAN, AND THAT IT NOT 
BE TIED TO COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS.  THE EU DEL, WHILE 
AGREEING WITH AUSTRALIA THAT FOOD AID SHOULD BE IN FULL 
GRANT FORM, NOTED THAT THE DEFINITION OF EMERGENCY FOOD 
AID WAS NOT WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE CSSD AND SUGGESTED 
THAT THE CSSD AWAIT THE RESULTS OF THE WTO NEGOTIATION 
TO DETERMINE ITS ROLE.  BOTH DELS STRESSED THE NEED FOR 
INCREASED TRANSPARENCY.  OTHER COUNTRIES WERE GENERALLY 
SUPPORTIVE OF AUSTRALIA AND THE EU, INCLUDING NEW 
ZEALAND, ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, HUNGARY AND MEXICO. 
 
¶17.   THE U.S. STATEMENT UNDERSCORED THE HUMANITARIAN 
IMPERATIVE FOR FOOD AID AND RESPONDED TO POINTS MADE IN 
THE PAPER REGARDING REPORTING OF FOOD AID TRANSACTIONS. 
THE U.S. ALSO CALLED FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY IN FOOD AID 
TRANSACTIONS FOR ALL DONORS AND ENCOURAGED AN INCREASED 
ROLE FOR THE CSSD IN THE FUTURE AGREEMENT ON AGRICULTURE 
WITHIN THE WTO. 
 
¶18.   JAPAN SUPPORTED THE U.S. STATEMENT RECOGNIZING THE 
HUMANITARIAN NEED FOR FOOD AID.  JAPAN ENCOURAGES A 
FLEXIBLE FRAMEWORK (I.E., LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES 
SHOULD RECEIVE FULL GRANTS, BUT CONCESSION TERMS SHOULD 
ALSO BE ALLOWABLE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL FOOD 
AID NEEDS WOULD BE COVERED).

PAGE 04        ROME  01662  03 OF 04  171535Z 
 
¶19.   THE LDCS WERE SILENT ON THIS TOPIC WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF INDONESIA, WHICH PRESENTED A STATEMENT 
UNDERSCORING THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 
AND THE N 
EED FOR SPEEDY DELIVERY.  ACKNOWLEDGING THAT 
THE WTO IS TO PROVIDE A DEFINITION OF EMERGENCY FOOD 
AID, THE INDONESIAN DEL UNDERSCORED THAT DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES NEED FOOD AID AND THAT COMPROMISE ON THIS 
ISSUE IS REQUIRED. 
¶20.   ADOPTION OF THE REPORT. AS THE UNITED STATES WAS 
NOT IN THE DRAFTING COMMITTEE (CANADA REPRESENTED NORTH 
AMERICA), THE U.S. DELEGATION SOUGHT IN THE FINAL 
PLENARY TO INTRODUCE CHANGES TO THE FINAL REPORT.  THE 
FIRST SUGGESTION SOUGHT TO REVISE A RECOMMENDATION THAT 
THE FAO IDENTIFY "WINNERS AND LOSERS" FROM 
"PROTECTIONISM" AND DOMESTIC SUPPORT TO MAKE THE 
RECOMMENDATION LESS POLITICALLY CHARGED AND MORE 
ANALYTICAL IN NATURE.  THE SECOND SUGGESTION AIMED AT 
BALANCING THE RECORD OF THE FOOD AID DISCUSSION TO 
INCLUDE THE POSITION CXPRESSED BY THE UNITED STATES AND 
OTHERS THAT FOOD AID DONATIONS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN 
FOOD SECURITY AND SHOULD BE MADE IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE 
FOOD AID CONVENTION AND DISCIPLINES TO BE ARTICULATED IN

COUNTRIES FOCUSSED MORE ON THE FACT THAT THE U.S. WAS 
PROPOSING CHANGES IN THE PLENARY THAN ON THE SUBSTANCE 
OF THE CHANGES, AND CONSENSUS COULD NOT BE REACHED ON 
THE PROPOSED U.S. LANGUAGE.  RECOGNIZING AFTER SOME 
DISCUSSION THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING ITS PROPOSALS 
ACCEPTED WAS SLIM, THE U.S. DELEGATION INDICATED TO THE 
CHAIR THAT IT WOULD NOT BLOCK CONSENSUS BUT WOULD HAVE 
TO DISASSOCIATE ITSELF FROM IT.  COMMENT: UNFORTUNATELY, 
THE LESS THAN ADROIT CHAIR DID NOT FACILITATE, AND EVEN 
HINDERED, CONSIDERATION OF THE U.S. PROPOSAL. 
 
¶21.   AT THE CLOSING, THE DELEGATE FROM THE REPUBLIC OF 
KOREA EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT THE CCP MEETING HAD BEEN 
POORLY ORGANIZED AND NOT VERY PRODUCTIVE.  HE SUGGESTED 
THAT THE CCP BE FOLDED INTO PAO'S COMMITTEE ON 
AGRICULTURE (COAG).  THE SECRETARIAT INDICATED 
WILLINGNESS TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF THE CCP MEETING 
AND ASKED FOR INPUT FROM COUNTRIES.  THE NEXT MEETING OF 
THE CCP IS SCHEDULED FOR 2OO5.
