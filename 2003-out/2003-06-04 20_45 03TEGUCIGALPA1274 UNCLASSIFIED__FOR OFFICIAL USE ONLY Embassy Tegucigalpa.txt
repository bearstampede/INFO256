¶1. (U) The Government of Honduras has signed but not yet 
ratified both the 2002 Inter-American Convention Against 
Terrorism (ref A), as well as the 1971 Convention to Prevent 
and Punish the Acts of Terrorism Taking the Forms of Crimes 
Against Persons and Related Extortion that are of 
International Significance.  USG officials, from the 
Secretary to the Ambassador to PolOff, have repeatedly urged 
 
SIPDIS 
senior GOH officials, including President Ricardo Maduro and 
Foreign Minister Guillermo Perez-Cadalso Arias, to ratify 
these two conventions, as well as five UN counterterrorism 
conventions/protocols that the GOH has yet to sign and/or 
ratify (refs B and C). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Senior GOH officials have told EmbOffs that they 
will soon submit the two OAS conventions to the Congress for 
approval, but they have yet to do so.  No GOH official has 
voiced any concern to EmbOffs that ratifying the two 
conventions would be problematic for Honduras.  Neither the 
GOH nor Post believe that congressional approval would be 
difficult or controversial.  Once Congress has approved the 
conventions and the congressional resolution has been 
published in La Gaceta (akin to the Federal Register), the 
GOH would then need to deposit its instruments of 
ratification with the OAS.  Post notes that the Honduran 
Congress is currently on recess until early July. 
 
¶3. (U) Post recommends that the U.S. delegation to the OAS 
Assembly in Santiago urge the Honduran delegation to move 
promptly to ratify the two OAS counterterrorism conventions 
without further delay.
