(C) PolOff delivered reftel points regarding Libya's 
acknowledgement of its WMD programs to Dutch MFA Special 
Advisor for Nonproliferation Ambassador Arend Meerburg on 
December 22.  Meerburg expressed appreciation for the 
information, saying he would use the points to draft material 
for Dutch MFA Secretary General Frank Majoor's visit to 
Washington January 7-9.  Amb. Meerburg indicated SecGen 
Majoor would have an extensive program in Washington, 
including nonproliferation and potential EU - U.S. 
cooperation during the 2004 Dutch EU Presidency.  He 
commented that Libya's statement may cause the Arab nations 
to demand similar actions by Israel, adding pressure to the 
current conflict. Further, Meerburg speculated the Libyan 
decision may have a positive effect on Syria and its 
leadership.
