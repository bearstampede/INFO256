SUBJECT:  WORRIED IRAQIS APPROACH THE EMBASSY 
ABOUT RENEWING THEIR IRAQI PASSPORTS 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (U) This is an action request, please see para 
¶4. 
 
¶3. (C) The Embassy has received calls in the last 
two days from a number of Iraqi citizens resident 
in the UAE requesting urgent information on how 
they should go about renewing their Iraqi 
passports.   Polchief confirmed 5/28 with a 
resident Iraqi citizen doctor that the Iraqi 
Embassy in Abu Dhabi ceased all consular operations 
earlier this week.  The Iraqis who have contacted 
us are worried that their inability to renew their 
passports will jeopardize their residency status in 
the UAE and make it impossible for them to travel 
outside the country.  The Iraqis have already 
approached the UAE authorities, who in turn have 
directed them to the U.S. Embassy for answers.  The 
UAE hosts a large Iraqi population, estimated at 
approximately 30,000.   We imagine other posts with 
large Iraqi communities will receive similar 
queries and that, absent answers, this issue will 
make its way into the local and, possibly, the 
international press. 
 
¶4. (U) ACTION REQUEST: Understanding the 
complexities of this issue, we request the 
Department's guidance at the earliest possible 
opportunity.
