E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ETRD PBTS IZ JO
SUBJECT: GOJ CALLS FOR END TO ADMIN FEES AT TREBIL BORDER 
 
THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST; SEE PARA 3. 
 
¶1.  (sbu)  Jordanian Minister of Planning Bassem Awadallah 
sent a letter to the Ambassador July 13 to voice concern over 
administrative processing fees imposed at the Trebil border 
crossing.  Text of letter follows: 
 
¶2.  (sbu)  Begin text: 
 
(complimentary opening) 
 
Kindly note that we have become aware of the recently imposed 
levying of administrative fees at the Trebil Border which 
applies to all transportation excluding diplomatic and 
humanitarian assistance convoys. 
 
These administrative fees are only levied at the 
Jordanian-Iraqi border crossings and will as such 
significantly affect the overall flow of goods from and 
through Jordan into Iraq, in addition to adversely affecting 
Jordan's efforts to facilitate the movement of vehicles and 
goods through this border crossing point.  It would be 
greatly appreciated if this arrangement is reconsidered in 
order to ensure that Jordan receives similar treatment as 
compared with other neighboring countries. 
 
(complimentary closing) 
 
End text. 
 
¶3.  (u)  Action request:  We would appreciate a formal 
response from CPA to forward to the GOJ outlining the purpose 
of the fee and its applicability, if appropriate, at other 
(non-Jordanian) border crossing points.  Many thanks. 
 
¶4.  (u)  Baghdad minimize considered.
