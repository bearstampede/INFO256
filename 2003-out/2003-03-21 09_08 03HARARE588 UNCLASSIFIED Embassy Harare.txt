  ¶1.   Under headline "Bush, Blair must learn from 
      history" the government-controlled daily "Chronicle" 
      dedicated its March 21 editorial to declaring that the 
      war against Iraq is uncalled for and is bound to fail, 
      adding, "America must not be allowed to bully the 
      world."  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   "German autocrat, Otto von Bismarck, was once 
      caricatured as a man walking on gunpowder with a 
      burning cigarette in his mouth.  We regret that 
      this could easily apply to America's George Bush 
      and Britain's Tony Blair who seem to have learnt 
      nothing from history.  History will record that 
      unilateral steps taken by superpowers have 
      failed in the past. . .  There is no 
      justification whatsoever for the Americans to 
      use morality as a reason for ousting Iraqi 
      President Saddam Hussein when it is clear that 
      their desire is to control oil production. 
      History will record the failures of these 
      unilateral campaigns.  Need we remind the 
      Americans of their failure in the Gulf War to 
      oust President Hussein or their disastrous 
      campaign in Vietnam. .  .  While we appreciate 
      Bush's zeal to redeem himself after the 
      disastrous campaign in Afghanistan, where he has 
      failed to track down Osama bin Laden, we feel 
      that by attacking Iraq, he has taken matters too 
      far.  The U.S., which has since assumed the role 
      of the world's policeman like Hitler tried to 
      do, has defied the United Nations - thus showing 
      the irrelevance of the body in policing 
      superpowers. 
 
      ". . .It is sad that the U.S., which is fighting 
      to control Iraqi oil, has in the past lied to 
      the world that it was concerned about human 
      rights issues in the Middle East country.  The 
      truth is out . . .!  The Americans, in a clear 
      fear of the unknown, have said that they fear 
      reprisals from terrorist organizations.  We say 
      that those who live in glass houses should not 
      throw stones.  Here will be a typical case of 
      violence begetting violence.  For as long as the 
      Americans bully other nations and ignore the 
      United Nations, we do not wish them well.  We 
      wait with anticipation for those who have 
      declared a jihad on America to remind George 
      Bush et al that the oil he wishes to control is 
      not worth the blood that will be shed in the war 
      against Iraq.  America must not be allowed to 
      bully the world.  We are not all American."
