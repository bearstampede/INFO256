¶1. (SBU) REFUGEE RETURNS, RECONSTRUCTION, AND ETHNIC 
RELATIONS DOMINATED A RECENT VISIT TO DONJI LAPAC, A 
MUNICIPALITY OF 3,400 NEAR CROATIA'S WESTERN BORDER WITH 
BOSNIA.  SEVERELY AFFECTED BY THE WAR, BOTH IN TERMS OF 
DISPLACEMENT OF THE POPULATION AND DESTRUCTION OF 
INFRASTRUCTURE, THE MUNICIPALITY IS BEGINNING TO SHOW SOME 
SIGNS OF RENEWAL.  THE CHALLENGE WILL BE FOR THE COMMUNITY TO 
MAINTAIN REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME 
EXPANDING AVENUES FOR CONSTRUCTIVE PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT DECISION-MAKING. 
 
SEVERELY AFFECTED BY THE WAR 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) DONJI LAPAC SUFFERED MIGHTILY IN 1995, THOUGH NOT 
APPARENTLY IN THE FIGHTING TO RETAKE THE TOWN.  IT WAS IN THE 
DAYS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE REASSERTION OF CROATIAN 
CONTROL THAT MANY OF THE SERB-OWNED HOUSES WERE DAMAGED OR 
DESTROYED.  NEARLY EIGHT YEARS LATER SIGNS OF THE WAR REMAIN 
LARGELY UNCHANGED -- OF 614 DAMAGED OR DESTROYED HOUSES ONLY 
54 HAVE BEEN REBUILT.  MANY HOMES STILL BEAR ON THEIR WALLS A 
HAND PAINTED SIGN OF THE TIME -- "DON'T BURN, RIJEKA POLICE" 
-- INFORMING CROATS OF THE VARIOUS POLICE UNITS THAT WERE 
EITHER OCCUPYING OR USING THE HOUSES.  THE CENTER OF THE TOWN 
CONSISTS MOSTLY OF BOMBED OUT OR DESTROYED BUILDINGS.  THERE 
ARE NO STORES OR RESTAURANTS, AND THE ONE FORMER HOTEL IS 
BOARDED UP. 
 
¶3. (SBU) THE TOWN OF DONJI LAPAC DID NOT HAVE A CHURCH OF ANY 
CREED PRIOR TO THE WAR.  THE MUNICIPALITY HAD A TOTAL 
POPULATION OF 4,600 IN THE 1991 CENSUS, 4,460 OF WHOM WERE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00862  01 OF 02  180844Z 
SERBS.  CROATS MADE UP LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE 
POPULATION.  ALMOST ALL THE SERBS FLED THE REGION IN AUGUST 
1995 DURING OPERATION STORM.  THE GOC THEN INVITED BOSNIAN 
CROATS AND CROATS FROM OTHER PARTS OF CROATIA (SO-CALLED 
"SETTLERS") TO INHABIT THE AREA.  EVENTUALLY 178 BOSNIAN 
CROATS AND 254 CROAT SETTLERS ACCEPTED THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFER 
AND TOOK UP RESIDENCY.  HOUSES AND APARTMENTS VACATED BY 
SERBS WERE OCCUPIED, AND MANY OF THESE WERE OCCUPIED 
ILLEGALLY -- THAT IS, WITHOUT OFFICIAL DECISIONS GRANTING 
TEMPORARY OCCUPANCY.  TODAY APPROXIMATELY 2,800 SERBS AND 450 
CROATS RESIDE IN THE MUNICIPALITY. 
 
¶4. (C) ACCORDING TO MILAN DJUKIC, THE MAYOR, 45 PRIVATELY 
OWNED HOMES STILL HAVE "TEMPORARY OCCUPANTS," AND NO HOMES 
HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNERS.  HE SAID OF 
THESE, APPROXIMATELY 35 ARE OCCUPIED BY BOSNIAN CROATS WHO 
OWN HOMES IN BOSNIA, YET REMAIN IN CROATIA BECAUSE THEY 
EITHER CANNOT OR WILL NOT RETURN TO BOSNIA.  THE MAYOR 
STRESSED THAT RESTITUTION OF PROPERTY TO SERBS CANNOT BE 
DEALT WITH UNTIL THE SITUATION OF BOSNIAN CROATS IS RESOLVED. 
 HOWEVER, DJUKIC THEN SAID "TO PREVENT SERBS FROM RETURNING" 
IS THE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT.  HE FURTHER ACCUSED THE 
GOVERNMENT WITH "CONTINUING A POLICY OF ETHNIC CLEANSING OF 
THE POPULATION."  DJUKIC WAS NOT ABLE TO SQUARE HIS 
INFLAMMATORY ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT WITH HIS 
CLAIM THAT THE SERB POPULATION OF DONJI LAPAC CONTINUES TO 
INCREASE, AND WILL AGAIN LIKELY REACH NEARLY 100 PERCENT. 
 
THE MUNICIPALITY 
---------------- 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00862  01 OF 02  180844Z 
¶5. (SBU) DONJI LAPAC MUNICIPALITY IS IN LIKA, CLOSE TO THE 
BOSNIAN BORDER, OVER THREE HOURS SOUTH OF ZAGREB BY CAR. 
VERY POOR ROADS EFFECTIVELY ISOLATE THE REGION, WHICH IN 
WINTER MONTHS CAN BE COMPLETELY CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF 
CROATIA.  THE REGION WAS ORIENTED TRADITIONALLY TOWARD BIHAC 
IN BOSNIA, WHICH IS LESS THAN 20 MILES TO THE NORTH.  LIKE 
OTHER TOWNS AND MUNICIPALITIES IN THE WAR-AFFECTED AREAS, 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM.  OUTSIDE SMALL-SCALE FAMILY 
RUN AGRICULTURE, THERE ARE ALMOST NO JOBS OTHER THAN 
GOVERNMENT JOBS.  HOWEVER, THOSE JOBS ARE RARELY OPEN TO 
SERBS OR RETURNEES.  THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SERB ON THE POLICE 
FORCE OF 60 OFFICERS.  ONLY TWO OF THE 30 EMPLOYEES OF LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION ARE SERBS.  DJUKIC TOLD US THERE 
ARE NO SERB TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOL, ALTHOUGH LATER WE WERE 
TOLD THAT TWO PART-TIME TEACHERS COME CONDUCT SERBIAN 
LANGUAGE CLASSES. 
 
¶6. (C) ALL NGOS AGREED THAT PEOPLE FEEL DISAPPOINTED WITH THE 
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT.  THERE ARE NO MEANINGFUL AVENUES FOR 
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE MUNICIPALITY, 
AND VERY LITTLE HAPPENS WITHOUT THE MAYOR'S EXPRESSED 
APPROVAL OR PARTICIPATION.  A YOUNG WOMAN WITH A SOCIAL 
SERVICE NGO SAID THE CURRENT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE REMINDED 
HER OF HOW IT WAS UNDER SOCIALISM.  THERE IS NO TRANSPARENCY.

AND NO ONE KNOWS HOW, OR WHY, OR WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM." 
 ACCORDING TO THE NGOS WE SPOKE WITH, THERE IS NO KNOWLEDGE 
OF THE MUNICIPAL BUDGET, OR HOW DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE. 
THERE HAVE BEEN NO SPORT, CULTURAL OR OTHER PUBLIC EVENTS 
UNDER THE MAYOR.  THE PROGRAM FOR THE ANNUAL "MUNICIPAL DAY" 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00862  02 OF 02  180845Z 
WAS ANNOUNCED SUDDENLY WHEN NGOS RECEIVED INVITATIONS TO 
ATTEND.  AS FAR AS THEY KNEW THERE WERE NO MEETINGS OR OPEN 
DISCUSSIONS HELD IN ADVANCE TO DEVELOP THE PROGRAM.  ONE NGO 
TOLD US THAT THEY WAITED NEARLY A YEAR TO GET A MEETING WITH 
THE MAYOR, WHOSE OFFICE IS A STONE'S THROW AWAY. 
 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
--------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) SOME RAYS OF HOPE EXIST ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT. 
AGRICULTURE WAS THE MAINSTAY OF THE REGION, AND EFFORTS ARE 
UNDERWAY TO REVITALIZE THIS SECTOR.  MOST FARMERS RAISED 
LIVESTOCK -- CATTLE, SHEEP, AND HORSES -- AND SOME 
SMALL-SCALE DAIRY ACTIVITY HAS RESTARTED.  PLANS ARE AT THE 
FEASIBILITY STAGE FOR A LARGE-SCALE POULTRY-PROCESSING PLAN, 
WHICH WOULD RELY ON LOCAL FARMERS FOR SUPPLY OF CHICKENS. 
HOWEVER, ACCESS TO FINANCING REMAINS A HUGE OBSTACLE.  DUE TO 
DESTRUCTION OR LOSS OF LAND RECORDS IN THE WAR, FEW FARMERS 
ARE ABLE TO PROVE OWNERSHIP OF LAND, THE ONLY REAL COLLATERAL 
THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE FOR A LOAN.  ZAMIR.NET, A USAID FUNDED 
NGO PROVIDING INTERNET ACCESS AND TRAINING, ARE WORKING MORE 
AND MORE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE ON JOB SEARCH SKILLS AND 
TECHNIQUES, AND THEY ARE TEACHING LOCAL BUSINESSMEN WEB 
MARKETING SKILLS.  ACCORDING TO ZAMIR.NET, EXPECTATIONS ARE 
HIGH, AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR WANT TO ACQUIRE COMPUTER 
SKILLS SO THAT THEY CAN COMPETE FOR NEW JOBS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶8. (C) IN PART DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE MAYOR'S OPENNESS TO 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00862  02 OF 02  180845Z 
INVOLVING REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL CITIZENS IN THE GOVERNANCE 
OF THE COMMUNITY, USAID HAS ALLOWED ITS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT 
WITH THE MUNICIPALITY TO LAPSE.  DONJI LAPAC FACES THE SAME 
PROBLEMS CONFRONTING MANY OTHER WAR-AFFECTED AREAS -- 
ISOLATION, DEPOPULATION, SEVERE UNEMPLOYMENT, LACK OF 
HOUSING, AND OBSOLETE, DAMAGED OR DESTROYED INFRASTRUCTURE -- 
PROBLEMS THAT ARE BEYOND THE CAPABILITY OF ONE MAN TO SOLVE, 
AND WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF THE 
BROADER COMMUNITY.  "WEB MARKETING FOR BUSINESSMEN" MAY NOT 
BE THE ANSWER AT THIS POINT IN TIME, BUT WHILE IT MAY SEEM 
FANCIFUL, IT DOES INDICATE AT LEAST SOME PEOPLE ARE HOPEFUL 
ABOUT THE FUTURE.  THE CHALLENGE IN THE NEAR TERM WILL BE TO 
MEET AT LEAST MINIMALLY SOME OF THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE 
COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES.
