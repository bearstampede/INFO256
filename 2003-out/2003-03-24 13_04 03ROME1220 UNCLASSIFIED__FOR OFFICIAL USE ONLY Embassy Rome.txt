¶1. (SBU) ON MARCH 26, WORLD FOOD PROGRAM WILL, SUBJECT TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01220  01 OF 05  241311Z 
THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE UN 
COLLECTIVE APPEAL FOR IRAQ, RELEASE A REGIONAL EMERGENCY 
OPERATION (EMOP) FOR IRAQ VALUED AT U.S. 1.23 BILLION (1.6 
MILLION TONS), BENEFITING UP TO 27.1 MILLION BENEFICIARIES - 
COVERING THE PERIOD MARCH 25 -SEPTEMBER 25, 2003. IN PHASE 
ONE (FIRST MONTH FROM OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES), WFP PLANS TO 
ASSIST 2.1 MILLION VULNERABLE PEOPLE THROUGH LIMITED CROSS- 
BORDER OPERATIONS AND REFUGEES IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. IN 
PHASE TWO (THE FOLLOWING THREE MONTHS), WFP PLANS SUPPORT TO 
ENSURE THAT THE NATIONAL FOOD PIPELINE AND PUBLIC 
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM CONTINUE TO FUNCTION WHILE CONTINUING TO 
ASSIST REFUGEES, INTERNALLY DISPLACED AND ESPECIALLY 
NUTRITIONALLY VULNERABLE GROUPS. IN PHASE THREE (MONTHS FIVE 
AND SIX), WFP ASSUMES THAT THE PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM 
WILL BE RE-ESTABLISHED, AND WILL THEREFORE TARGET SOME 4.9 
MILLION BENEFICIARIES - 1.3 MILLION REFUGEES, 2.8 MILLION 
INTERNALLY DISPLACED AND 700,000 EXTREMELY VULNERABLE. 
 
¶2. (SBU) THE BUDGET REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PRESENT EMOP COVER 
THE FULL OPERATIONAL AND SUPPORT COSTS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT 
WFP'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS, INCLUDING THE COSTS 
OF FOOD COMMODITIES, TRANSPORT, STAFF AND EQUIPMENT 
CURRENTLY FUNDED THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS' IRAQ ESCROW 
ACCOUNT UNDER UN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION (SCR) 986. THIS 
IS JUSTIFIED BY THE FACT THAT WFP CANNOT ASSUME THAT FUNDING 
FOR THE SCR 986 HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM WILL BE MAINTAINED, 
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE CURRENT 180-DAY 
EXTENSION OF THE PROVISIONS OF SCR 986, ON JUNE 4, 2003. 
HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT THAT A NEW OR REVISED SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTION GIVES WFP ACCESS TO APPROVED FOOD CONTRACTS 
CURRENTLY IN THE SCR 986 PIPELINE, OR PROVIDES WFP WITH 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01220  01 OF 05  241311Z 
FUNDING FOR NEW CONTRACTS AS WELL AS ASSOCIATED OPERATIONAL 
COSTS, WFP WOULD IMMEDIATELY REDUCE ITS APPEAL TO DONORS 
ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶3. (SBU) US MISSION STRONGLY URGES IMMEDIATE U.S. SUPPORT 
FOR WFP'S EMOP REQUEST, PARTICULARLY INITIAL CASH 
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WILL ALLOW FOR MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY. END

SUBJECT: WFP TO LAUNCH IRAQ REGIONAL EMERGENCY OPERATION FOR 
2003 - USD 1.23 BILLION 
 
ALLOWED FOR THE PURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL 23,000 METRIC TONS 
OF CEREALS. THE PRE-POSITIONING OF SOME 29,000 METRIC TONS 
OF COMMODITIES AT A TOTAL COST OF U.S. 16.0 MILLION DOLLARS 
PUTS WFP IN A POSITION TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY TO A 
POTENTIALLY LARGE-SCALE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN IRAQ AND 
SURROUNDING COUNTRIES. 
 
¶5. (SBU) CONCURRENTLY, SPECIAL OPERATION (SO) 10257.0 
"PREPAREDNESS MEASURES IN VIEW OF A POTENTIAL CRISIS 
AFFECTING IRAQ AND NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES" WAS LAUNCHED AT A 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01220  02 OF 05  241311Z 
TOTAL COST OF U.S. 7.5 MILLION, CONSISTING OF CAPACITY 
DEVELOPMENT AND AUGMENTATION IN THE AREAS OF 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND LOGISTICS, AND INTENDED TO ENABLE WFP 
TO RAPIDLY LAUNCH A COMPLEX EMERGENCY OPERATION AND MEET ITS 
INTER-AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES AS THE LEAD AGENCY FOR ICT AND 
LOGISTICS COORDINATION (UNJLC). 
 
¶6. (SBU) APPROXIMATELY 480,000 METRIC TONS OF FOOD 
COMMODITIES ARE DISTRIBUTED EVERY MONTH TO THE ENTIRE IRAQI 
POPULATION THROUGH THE PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (PDS). 
THE SYSTEM IS WELL ESTABLISHED, EFFICIENT AND THE PRIMARY 
SOURCE OF BASIC FOOD COMMODITIES FOR THE POPULATION. IN THE 
15 CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN GOVERNORATES, THE IRAQI MINISTRY OF 
TRADE (MOT) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION PROCESS, 
WHILE WFP HAS THE MANDATE TO IMPLEMENT THE DISTRIBUTION IN 
THE THREE NORTHERN GOVERNORATES. THE ACTUAL DISTRIBUTION OF 
THE FOOD RATION IS UNDERTAKEN BY A COUNTRY-WIDE NETWORK OF 
44,000 FOOD AND FLOUR AGENTS (11,000 IN THE THREE NORTHERN 
GOVERNORATES AND 33,000 IN THE CENTER/SOUTH). 
 
¶7. (SBU) THE CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE OF THE PDS FOR THE FOOD 
SECURITY OF THE ENTIRE IRAQI POPULATION CANNOT BE 
OVERSTATED. ACCORDING TO THE ASSESSMENT OF THE WFP 
OBSERVATION MECHANISM IN IRAQ, 60 PERCENT OF THE IRAQI 
POPULATION RELY ALMOST ENTIRELY ON THE SCR 986 FOOD RATION 
FOR THEIR DAILY SUBSISTENCE.  OTHER COPING MECHANISMS FOR 
THE PRIMARILY URBAN POPULATION HAVE BEEN HEAVILY ERODED BY 
THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE SANCTIONS.  ANY SIGNIFICANT 
DISRUPTION IN THE PDS WOULD HAVE DRAMATIC HUMANITARIAN 
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE IRAQI POPULATION WITHIN A VERY BRIEF 
PERIOD.

WFP'S PLANNED RESPONSE 
---------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) WFP'S RESPONSE IS TWO-FOLD: SUPPORTING THE PDS 
MANAGEMENT WHILE MAINTAINING ITS OWN FOOD PIPELINE FOR AN 
INTERIM PERIOD. AS SOON AS FEASIBLE (MONTH TWO ONWARDS), WFP 
WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT TO ENSURE THAT THE FOOD PIPELINE AND 
THE PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM CONTINUE TO FUNCTION. WFP 
WILL ALSO ADDRESS (FROM MONTH ONE) THE EMERGENCY FOOD NEEDS 
OF IRAQI POPULATIONS WHO WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE PDS. 
THIS WOULD INCLUDE REFUGEES IN NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES; 
INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS), WHO WOULD NO LONGER BE 
ABLE TO COLLECT THEIR FOOD RATION FROM THE FOOD AGENT THEY 
ARE CURRENTLY REGISTERED WITH; AND VULNERABLE GROUPS WITHIN 
IRAQ (THROUGH LIMITED CROSS-BORDER OPERATIONS), FOR WHOM 
SPECIAL ATTENTION IS REQUIRED. 
 
¶9. (SBU) IN MONTHS TWO THROUGH FOUR, WFP PLANS TO REACH UP 
TO 27.1 MILLION BENEFICIARIES (MONTHLY) DURING THIS PERIOD, 
INCLUDING REFUGEES IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, IDPS AND THE

¶13. (SBU) THE UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES IN IRAQ HAVE NOW 
LOCATED TO A COMMON HUMANITARIAN CO-ORDINATION CENTRE BASED 
IN LARNACA, CYPRUS, AND STAFF HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED IN 
COUNTRIES NEIGHBOURING IRAQ.  WFP'S RESPONSE TO THE IRAQ 
REGIONAL CRISIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF 
THE OCHA-CO-ORDINATED INTER-AGENCY HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE FOR 
IRAQ.  THE UNITED NATION'S HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR IRAQ 
HAS BEEN DESIGNATED TO ASSUME A REGIONAL CO-ORDINATION ROLE 
FOR THE DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN AID TO IRAQ.

¶15. (SBU) UPON RE-ENTRY OF INTERNATIONAL STAFF INTO IRAQ, 
WFP IS PLANNING ON SETTING UP AND EQUIPPING AN APPROPRIATE 
NETWORK OF OFFICES AND FACILITIES, INCLUDING IT, 
COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT, COVERING THE 18 
GOVERNORATES. THIS WOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN A STAGED MANNER, 
SUBJECT TO A PERMISSIBLE ENVIRONMENT. 
 
¶16. (SBU) IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS OPERATION WILL REQUIRE A 
MASSIVE GEARING UP OF STAFFING LEVELS IN THE NEIGHBORING 
COUNTRIES, BUT PRIMARILY WITHIN IRAQ UPON RE-ENTRY. THE 
PRESENT BUDGET PROVIDES FOR A TOTAL OF 334 INTERNATIONAL 
PROFESSIONALS AND 3,000 NATIONAL STAFF, OF WHOM 40 PERCENT 
AND 65 PERCENT RESPECTIVELY WILL BE REQUIRED IMMEDIATELY 
UPON RE-ENTRY. THE ROLE OF NATIONAL STAFF WILL BE 
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT UPON RE-ENTRY, TO SUPPORT EXTENSIVE

WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS EMOP. 
 
¶17. (SBU) PRESENTLY, WITHIN IRAQ, WFP RETAINED TEAMS OF TEN 
NATIONAL OBSERVERS IN EACH GOVERNORATE. OF THESE, THREE 
TRAINED AND EXPERIENCED NATIONAL STAFF HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED 
TO LEAD THE TEAM TO CARRY OUT NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, COORDINATE 
WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES, AND ORGANIZE THE RECEIPT, 
DISTRIBUTION AND MONITORING OF THE FOOD.  THESE STAFF WILL 
BE TASKED WITH THE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF ASSESSING 
THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PDS, THE ABILITY OF THE FOOD AGENTS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01220  04 OF 05  241312Z 
TO COLLECT AND DISTRIBUTE THE FOOD, AND TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE 
BOTTLENECKS SUCH AS THE SHORTAGE OF FUEL OR SPARE PARTS FOR 
FOOD AGENTS. UPON RE-ENTRY, THEY WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE 
IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MAJOR INTERVENTIONS THAT MAY BE 
REQUIRED VIS-A-VIS THE PDS IN THE POST-CONFLICT SITUATION. 
THESE TEAMS WILL BE FURTHER AUGMENTED WITH SUPPORT STAFF 
(ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS) DEPLOYED THROUGH A PRIVATE 
CONTRACTOR FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES TO MOTIVATE AND 
ORGANIZE MINISTRY OF TRADE (MOT) STAFF STILL OPERATIONAL IN 
EACH GOVERNORATE CAPITAL. COMMUNICATION WITH THE STAFF IN 
THE INITIAL STAGE WILL BE BY A POUCH SYSTEM WITH ARRIVING 
FOOD TRUCKS, AND ANY OTHER OPERATIONAL MEANS INCLUDING 
TELEPHONE TRUNK LINES AND NGO HF FACILITIES WHERE AVAILABLE. 
 
¶18. (SBU) DUE TO THE POSSIBLE DISRUPTION OF THE PDS, WFP 
WILL BE EXPECTED TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE DISTRIBUTION 
MECHANISM FROM EXTENDED DELIVERY POINTS (EDPS) TO THE FINAL 
DELIVERY POINTS (FDPS) AND BENEFICIARIES, AND TO IDENTIFY 
AND ADDRESS POSSIBLE BOTTLENECKS IN THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. 
TO THIS EFFECT, WFP WILL EMPLOY NATIONAL STAFF IN EACH 
GOVERNORATE AND INTENDS TO CONTRACT PRIVATE CONSULTANTS AND 
ENGAGE NGOS TO BE DEPLOYED IN EACH GOVERNORATE, TO PROVIDE 
SUPPORT TO THE MOT'S MANAGEMENT AND LOGISTICS STRUCTURES, AS 
WELL AS TO FOOD AGENTS. 
 
¶19. (SBU) SUPPORT MAY INVOLVE THE PROVISION OF FUEL TO FOOD 
AGENTS TO ENABLE THEM TO CARRY ON THE COLLECTION OF 
COMMODITIES FROM EDPS TO FDPS, DIVERSION OF LONG-HAUL TRUCKS 
DIRECTLY TO FDPS WHERE NEEDED, AND/OR WFP PROVIDING 
TRANSPORT CAPACITY THROUGH THE HIRING OF LOCAL TRANSPORT TO 
EFFECT DELIVERIES TO FDPS. DURING THE CONFLICT, IT IS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01220  04 OF 05  241312Z 
ENVISAGED THAT MOT STAFF MAY BE PROVIDED WITH IN-KIND 
PAYMENTS OF FOOD IN LIEU OF CASH AS INCENTIVES, GIVEN THE 
RISK EXPECTED IN MOVEMENT OF CASH FUNDS IN AN INSECURE 
ENVIRONMENT AND THE POSSIBLE DISRUPTION OF GOVERNMENT 
PAYROLL DISBURSEMENTS. 
 
¶20. (SBU) APPROXIMATELY 1,609,500 METRIC TONS OF FOOD 
COMMODITIES WILL BE MOVED INTO IRAQ OVER A SIX-MONTH PERIOD. 
GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE CONFLICT, THE REGIONAL 
LOGISTICS STRATEGY IS CENTRED ON A DIVERSIFICATION OF 
CORRIDORS, ROUTES AND MODALITIES AND A HIGH DEGREE OF 
FLEXIBILITY TO SWITCH BETWEEN THEM AT SHORT NOTICE. WFP IS 
ESTIMATING FOR PLANNING PURPOSES THAT FIVE PER CENT OF THE 
FOOD REQUIRED FOR THIS OPERATION WILL BE PROCURED LOCALLY OR 
REGIONALLY. A KEY ASSUMPTION FOR THIS EMOP IS THAT THE PORT 
OF UMM QASR WILL NOT BE ACCESSIBLE INITIALLY.  HENCE, WFP 
WILL RELY ON CORRIDORS THROUGH NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. 
LOGISTICS ARRANGEMENTS ARE IN ADVANCED STAGES IN THESE 
COUNTRIES, WITH PORT AND ROAD CAPACITY ASSESSMENTS 
FINALIZED, AND STANDBY TRANSPORT CAPACITY NEGOTIATED.

SUBJECT: WFP TO LAUNCH IRAQ REGIONAL EMERGENCY OPERATION FOR 
2003 - USD 1.23 BILLION 
 
¶21. (SBU) GIVEN THE HIGH PORT OFF-TAKE AND TRUCKING CAPACITY 
IT OFFERS, JORDAN WILL MOST LIKELY BE THE LARGEST OF THE 
MAIN SUPPLY ROUTES. ARRANGEMENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE WITH 
PORT AUTHORITIES AT AQABA TO DISCHARGE UP TO THREE VESSELS 
SIMULTANEOUSLY AND CONTRACTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING CONCLUDED 
WITH JORDANIAN TRANSPORTERS. TOTAL CAPACITY THROUGH THE 
JORDAN CORRIDOR IS ESTIMATED AT 300,000 METRIC TONS PER 
MONTH, FAR IN EXCESS OF THE NEEDS UNDER THIS EMOP. TURKEY 
WILL BE A MAJOR CORRIDOR FOR DELIVERIES TO NORTHERN IRAQ AND 
TRANSPORTERS HAVE BEEN LINED UP TO WORK OUT OF A NUMBER OF

DIFFERENT PORTS, INCLUDING ISKENDERUN AND MERSIN, FOR A 
THROUGHPUT OF 100,000 METRIC TONS PER MONTH. THE USE OF SEA 
PORTS IN LEBANON, SYRIA, KUWAIT AND IRAN ARE ALSO PART OF 
WFP'S STRATEGY TO TAKE UP THE BALANCE OF REQUIREMENTS, AND 
ON-FORWARDING ARRANGEMENTS TO IRAQ ARE IN PLACE.

¶22. (SBU) SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE OF THE HIGHEST 
PRIORITY DURING THE EVACUATION, CONFLICT AND RE-ENTRY PHASES 
OF THE EMOP. TO THIS END, WFP IS DEPLOYING SECURITY OFFICERS 
TO NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES AND IS WORKING IN CLOSE 
COLLABORATION WITH THE REGIONAL FIELD SECURITY OFFICER (FSO) 
IN LARNACA AND THE DESIGNATED OFFICIALS IN THE CONCERNED 
COUNTRIES.

COMMENT

¶23. (SBU) THIS IS THE LARGEST WFP APPEAL IN ITS HISTORY. US 
MISSION STRONGLY URGES IMMEDIATE U.S. SUPPORT FOR WFP'S EMOP 
REQUEST, PARTICULARLY INITIAL CASH CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WILL 
ALLOW FOR MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY.
