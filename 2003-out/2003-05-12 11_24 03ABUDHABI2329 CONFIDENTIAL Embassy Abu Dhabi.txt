SUBJECT: UAEG WELCOMES PRESIDENT'S SPEECH ON THE MIDDLE 
EAST 
 
REF: STATE 122033 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Charge D'Affaires Richard A. 
Albright, for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C) Charge drew from reftel points and provided a copy 
of the President's speech to MFA Assistant U/S Abdullah 
Rashid Al-Nuaimi, May 12.  Al-Nuaimi said that President's 
speech was welcome and timely.  It was particularly useful 
that Secretary Powell was out in the region to follow-up on 
the speech, the MFA official observed.  Both the 
Palestinians and the Israelis "need to get their act 
together," and both Arafat and Sharon need to do a lot of 
work internally.  The important thing is to achieve 
results.  Abu Mazen is "capable, pragmatic and we trust his 
vision."  There is also some sign of hope from Sharon's 
side.  But Al-Nuaimi stressed repeatedly that the process 
could not be permitted to derail because of terrorist 
attacks -- "these will happen, but should not be allowed to 
hijack the process."  Continued U.S. engagement would be 
key to alleviate the tensions between the two sides and to 
allow for on the ground disengagement between Israeli 
security forces and the Palestinian population. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Turning to the President's call for a free trade 
agreement with the Middle East in ten years, the MFA 
official said this was a commendable step.  It would be 
important to ensure that this essentially economic matter 
did not get placed into a political framework, but he noted 
"we all favor free trade."  Al-Nuaimi observed that the 
unstated goal of the U.S.-GCC Economic Dialogue is free 
trade between the U.S. and the GCC, but that "for some 
reason we have tended to get bogged down in the minutiae of 
our economic relationship and have lost sight of the real 
goal."  In that context, he suggested that an FTA with the 
GCC might usefully top the agenda for the Dialogue.
