delivered message to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  MFA 
Legal Adviser Samer Naber and Human Rights Officer Bisher

penalties for crimes involving child prostitution or 
pornography (reftel b).  Jordan is a signatory to the sexual 
exploitation protocol, but has yet to join.  He expressed 
confidence that the GOJ is &moving toward8 joining the 
protocol.

the GOJ &in practice8 does not violate the terms of the

for the GOJ to draft males 16 and above, in extreme 
circumstances.  Jordan is not a party to the Protocol.

and Khasawneh took the point, and said they would pass the 
message forward within the GOJ.
