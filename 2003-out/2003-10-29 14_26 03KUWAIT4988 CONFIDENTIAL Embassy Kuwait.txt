Khaled Al-Jarallah told the Ambassador that FM Shaykh Dr.
Mohammed Al-Sabah had consulted with his Saudi, Egyptian and
Jordanian counterparts. They had agreed that Saudi FM Prince
Saud al-Feisal would call Syrian FM Sharaa and press him to
invite the Iraqi Foreign Minister to the meeting of
neighboring states. Prince Saud was reportedly optimistic

that would turn the meeting into a positive development.
