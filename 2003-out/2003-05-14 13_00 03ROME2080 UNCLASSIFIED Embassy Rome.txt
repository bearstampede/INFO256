SUBJECT:  RESEARCH REFORM GOES AHEAD AND CNR PRESIDENT 
RESIGNS 
 
¶1.  ON MAY 13, LUCIO BIANCO, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL 
RESEARCH COUNCIL (CNR) RESIGNED.  DURING A PRESS CONFERENCE, 
BIANCO UNDERLINED THAT HE DECIDED TO QUIT "AFTER MANY MONTHS 
OF CONFRONTATIONS WITH RESEARCH AND UNIVERSITY MINISTER 
LETIZIA MORATTI AND HER RESEARCH REFORM PROPOSAL".  IN A 
"OPEN LETTER" TO THE RESEARCHERS, HE STATED THAT "THE 
CURRENT GOVERNMENT DENIES THE IMPORTANCE OF BASIC RESEARCH 
AND SUPPORTS ONLY APPLIED RESEARCH".  HOWEVER, THE LETTER 
DOES NOT DEFEND THE RESEARCHERS, WHO DID NOT REACT PROMPTLY 
AND ACTIVELY AGAINST THE RESEARCH REFORM AND THUS "WILL BE 
CO-RESPONSIBLE OF THE DISMANTLMENT OF A RESEARCH SYSTEM, 
WHICH IS STRUCTURALLY WEAK BUT STILL COMPETITIVE CONSIDERING 
THE FUNDS". 
 
¶2.  BIANCO BECAME CNR PRESIDENT ON APRIL 30, 1997 AND WAS 
REELECTED IN MAY 2001.  HE HAD STARTED HIS CAREER AS CNR 
RESEARCHER IN 1970. BIANCO DECIDED TO RESIGN WHEN HE LEARNT 
THAT THE RESEARCH REFORM PROPOSAL HAD BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE 
TECHNICAL ADVISORS OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND THUS 
WOULD HAVE BEEN DEFINITIVELY APPROVED VERY SOON.  PROF. 
ADRIANO DE MAJO, CURRENT RECTOR OF LUISS, A ROME-BASED 
PRIVATE UNIVERSITY, WILL BE APPOINTED AS CNR COMMISSIONER TO 
OVERSEE THE REFORM (SEPTEL).  SEMBLER
