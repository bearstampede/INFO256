SUBJECT: NEW INDEPENDENT WEEKLY HITS THE STREETS 
 
 
The independent Associated Newspapers of Zimbabwe 
(ANZ), publishers of "The Daily News," have added 
another title to their stable: "The Daily News On 
Sunday."  The first issue of Zimbabwe's newest Sunday 
paper hit the streets on May 18 with a print run of 
105,000.  Edited by veteran journalist William (Bill) 
Saidi, 66, the paper brings to five the number of 
weekly newspapers published on Sunday.  In its maiden 
editorial, the "Daily News On Sunday" declared: "It 
(the new newspaper) will be the real deal - nothing 
phony or staged."  Content and editorial policy appear 
to be very similar to that of the week-day "Daily 
News."
