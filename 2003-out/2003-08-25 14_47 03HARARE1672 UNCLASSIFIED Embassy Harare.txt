  ¶1.   Under headline "U. N. abuse by UK and U. S. must be 
      probed" the August 24 edition of the government- 
      controlled weekly "The Sunday Mail" carried the 
      following opinion piece by Tafataona Mahoso under 
      his regular column "African Focus": 
 
  ¶2.   "For those nations who seek to advance and uphold 
      international humanitarian ideals and principles, 
      the real tragedy of the recent attack on the U. N. 
      headquarters in Iraq is that Iraqis can no longer 
      separate UK-U. S. objectives in the aggression 
      against Iraq and the occupation of that country from 
      the U. N. mission which is supposed to be neutral 
      and strictly humanitarian.  The problem is that the 
      rightwing administrations of President George W. 
      Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have 
      criminally made the U. N. an accomplice of their 
      illegal occupation of Iraq. . .The Iraqi people need 
      to be rescued from all illegal aggression and 
      occupation which has resulted in the theft of their 
      petroleum. . .and the U. N. also requires rescuing 
      from its perceived complicity in the U. S.-UK crime 
      against the people of Iraq. . .The African Union 
      should persuade all those opposed to the unipolar 
      doctrine to convene an emergency session of the U. 
      ¶N. General Assembly to stop the U. S.-UK subversion 
      and prostitution of the U. N.  This should be done 
      for the sake of the Iraqi people. . . ."
