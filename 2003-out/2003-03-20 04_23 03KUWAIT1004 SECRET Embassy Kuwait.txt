E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 
TAGS: MARR MOPS PREL KU
SUBJECT: APPROVAL OF PROVISIONAL ENTRY OF FORCES INTO 
KUWAIT, PROVIDED THEY ARE UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE UNITED 
STATES 
 
Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbancic, reason: 1.5 (A) and (B) 
 
¶1.  (S)  THE GOK HAS AUTHORIZED NEW COALITION FORCES TO ENTER 
INTO KUWAIT WITHOUT A SIGNED STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT, 
PROVIDED (A) THEY ARE UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE UNITED STATES 
AND (B) SOFA NEGOTIATIONS ARE ONGOING.  THE AUTHORIZATION, IN 
A FORM SIMILAR TO THAT GRANTED TO THE CZECHS IN JANUARY, HAS 
NOW BEEN EXTENDED TO ALL NATIONS OF THE COALITION CURRENTLY 
WITHOUT STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENTS WITH THE STATE OF KUWAIT. 
 CENTCOM PLANNERS MAY NOW PROCEED WITH DEPLOYMENTS OF TROOPS 
FROM NEW MEMBERS OF THE COALITION WITH/WITH THE FOLLOWING 
STIPULATIONS: 
 
A)  FOR THE U.S. MILITARY:  ALL DEPLOYMENTS MUST/MUST STILL 
BE UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE UNITED STATES AND APPROVED BY THE 
GOK IN ADVANCE.  THIS IS A SIMPLE TASK, BUT IT MUST BE DONE 
IN COORDINATION WITH THE OFFICE OF MILITARY 
COOPERATION-KUWAIT.  OMC-K VICE COLONEL CHRISTOPHER CAMPBELL 
CAN PROVIDE GUIDANCE.  DO NOT/NOT ATTEMPT TO LAND TROOPS OF 
COUNTRIES WHICH DO NOT HAVE SOFAS WITH THE GOK WITHOUT PRIOR 
APPROVAL.  THEY WILL NOT BE GIVEN CLEARANCE AND MAY BE 
RETURNED HOME. 
 
B)  FOR EMBASSIES:  THIS IS NOT/NOT AN EXEMPTION FROM THE 
REQUIREMENT TO CONCLUDE BILATERAL SOFAS BETWEEN THE HOST AND 
SENDING COUNTRIES.  EMBASSIES SHOULD STILL PROVIDE THE 
STANDARD KUWAITI SOFA LANGUAGE TO PROSPECTIVE SENDING 
GOVERNMENTS FOR NEGOTIATION AND CONCLUSION WITH THE GOK. 
THIS IS ONLY A GOK CONCESSION TO ALLOW MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION 
OF NEW COALITION MEMBERS IN THE COALITION WITH A MINIMUM OF 
PAPERWORK.  THE SOFA REMAINS A FORMAL REQUIREMENT. 
 
¶2.  (U)  FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS ON SOFA ISSUES IN KUWAIT, 
CONTACT DCM FRANK URBANCIC, (965) 539-4723 OR ON SIPRNET.
