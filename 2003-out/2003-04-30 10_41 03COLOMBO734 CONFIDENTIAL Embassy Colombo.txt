PM LETTER TO BALASINGHAM 
------------------------ 
¶1. (C) We have received a copy of the Prime Minister's 
letter to LTTE chief negotiator Anton Balasingham 
replying to the Tigers' April 21 pullout from the peace 
talks.  We received the copy late this afternoon and will 
provide an analysis of it to you shortly.  It seems to be 
conciliatory in nature.  We are forwarding a copy of the 
letter to SA/INS via class e-mail.  (POL) 
 
¶2. (SBU) In other peace process news:  As previously 
reported, it is now out in the press that Balasingham is 
scheduled to visit the Wanni in northern Sri Lanka next 
week.  (Note:  Per Colombo 728, Moragoda was invited to 
by Balasingham to join him in the north next week for 
meetings.)  A Norwegian team was slated to meet with LTTE 
political chief S.P. Thamilchelvam today in the Wanni, 
but we have not yet received confirmation that the 
meeting in fact took place.  (POL) 
 
HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE 
--------------------- 
¶3. (C) FYI.  Pls pass to DRL:  We understand that the MFA 
wants to make our 2002 human rights report on Sri Lanka a 
topic for our annual human rights dialogue.  We're not 
sure whom from DRL will lead our side of the dialogue now 
that PDAS Parmly is gone nor when it will take place, but 
we wanted you to know the GSL wants this to be a topic. 
(POL) 
 
SINHALESE CHAUVINIST PARTY'S THREAT 
----------------------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) Please pass to S/CT:  In a public statement made 
on April 29, a senior member of the extremist, chauvinist 
Sihala Urumaya (SU) party said using suicide bombers 
against the LTTE would be a good idea.  We're not sure 
what to make of this.  From what we understand, this is 
the first time that such a threat has emerged from 
Sinhalese ranks.  The SU itself is small and full of 
cranks, but even uttering such threats is serious.

MAY DAY HOLIDAY 
--------------- 
¶5. (U) Sri Lanka will be celebrating May Day tomorrow and 
Mission will be closed.  (POL)
