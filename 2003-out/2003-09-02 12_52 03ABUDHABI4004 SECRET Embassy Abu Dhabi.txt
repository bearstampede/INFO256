SUBJECT:  UAEG ELECTS NOT TO AIR RECORDED THREAT TAPE 
RECEIVED BY ABU DHABI TV 
 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Charge d'Affaires, a.i., Richard 
Albright, for Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) Summary: A special assistant to UAE Armed Forces 
Chief of Staff Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed al-Nahyan 
delivered to Charge late September 1 an audio recording 
that had been delivered to Abu Dhabi TV in Baghdad.  The 
tape contains an oral message from someone claiming 
affiliation with Al Qaida, accusing US and coalition 
forces of being behind the Najaf bombing, threatening 
attacks on US, UK, and coalition forces if they do not 
withdraw from Iraq, and warning of biological weapons 
attacks in the US and the UK.  Senior UAEG officials 
doubt the recording's authenticity.  Minister of 
Information Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed al-Nahyan assured 
Charge that Abu Dhabi TV would not air the recording. 
End Summary. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to our translation from the Arabic, 
the male voice on the tape identifies himself as a 
member of a sub-unit of al-Qaida called al-Qaida al- 
Muharama, or al-Tanzeem al-Muharam, which means the 
sacred Qaida or the sacred organization.  The message is 
addressed to the Iraqi people, Arab countries, and the 
entire world.  The speaker starts with Qu'ranic verses 
then denies any linkage with the latest bombing in 
Najaf.  He accuses the U.S. and coalition forces of 
being behind this blast. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The voice on the tape issues threats to U.S., 
U.K and coalition troops in Iraq and warns that if they 
don't withdraw their forces from Iraq soon, they will 
face more killings and explosions.  "Beware of the 
coming hours," the speaker warns.  "We have biological 
weapons capable of exploding in the most congested 
areas, causing the most devastating casualties.  We 
already have the capability of putting together the most 
effective explosion in less than 35 minutes.  We already 
planted two of them within the U.S.  Our people can 
easily get into the U.S. and the U.K. planting such 
explosives on the most congested roads, and killing the 
highest number of people.  This will be a historic 
explosion and probably the last.  I hope this message 
will reach the American people." 
 
¶6. (SBU) The recording also warns that "if the U.S. and 
the U.K do not withdraw their forces from Iraq, 
killings and explosions will reach their roads."  There 
are also warnings for the Arab League and its members. 
"If you send troops into Iraq, explosions will reach 
your towns and cities, similar to what happened to the 
U.N, Saudi Arabia, and various other places."  The 
speaker then announced an award of USD 85 million for 
the person who kills Paul Bremer, and a similar award 
for the killing of any member of the current Iraqi 
Governing Council, specifically naming Ahmed Chalabi. 
The award would be delivered by the group's secret 
service planted all over Iraq. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Addressing media representatives in Iraq, 
especially "Al Jazeera" and Abu Dhabi TV, the speaker 
says, "I'm sending you this tape to ensure its airing 
on your channels to reach the whole world.  Your duty 
is to convey all that you witness in Al Ramada, 
Baghdad, and other Iraqi towns and cities.  We know 
where your offices are located in Iraq and can easily 
reach you if you don't convey the honest picture that 
you witness."  Focusing on Abu Dhabi TV, he says "we 
respect and love you."  He adds, "If you convey honest 
reporting, we will reward you and give you USD 1-2 
million.  Again we know how to get to you, and can 
protect you." 
 
¶8. (SBU) The speaker repeatedly identifies his troops 
by giving the units' names. "Our forces are composed of 
three units -- Hamza, Khalid Bin Al Walid, and Al 
Hassan wa Al Hussain -- who are the most powerful units 
ever."  He closes by asking the media to take this 
matter very seriously before it is too late. 
 
¶9. (C) COMMENT: Our native Arabic speaker political 
assistant remarked that the voice on the tape sounded 
like an uneducated Arab or a non-Arab who can only read 
due to his ability to read the Qur'an.  Several Arabic 
words were grammatically incorrect.
