Gundem / DEHAP members in eight provinces went 
to court yesterday in order to use the letters 
"x, q and w", (which do not exist in Turkish 
alphabet), when naming children.   (Editor's 
Note: Turkish law permits giving children 
Kurdish names, but local registrars often 
refuse names with letters not found in the 
Turkish alphabet.) 
 
 
¶3. Cumhuriyet / Fourteen people in Cukurca, 
Hakkari province, accused the security forces 
of pulling them through animal feces because 
they were PKK/KADEK supporters.  Witnesses 
reported that the forces broke a man's hands 
and a woman's shoulders.  The group brought 
suit against the security forces involved in 
the incident. 
 
 
¶4. Evrensel / In Yellice village, Kurtalan, Siirt, 
village guards relinquished their guns on 
September 1, Peace Day, and announced that they 
are for peace.

governor of Tunceli.  Erkal was removed from 
his position by court order in February and

back.  The High Court's decision will return 
him to the governorship. 
 
 
¶6. Bolge / There was a clash between the security
