BRIEFING 
 
 
PM Erdogan's Visit To Germany:  All papers give extensive 
front-page coverage to PM Erdogan's visit to Germany. 
"Sabah" reports that German Chancellor Schroeder extended 
full support to Turkey's EU bid.  Schroeder said that the 
accession of Turkey to the EU is in Germany's interest, and 
promised that Turkey would not be let down by Germany. 
"Hurriyet" highlights German Foreign Minister Fischer's 
comment that `this time Suleyman the Magnificent will not be 
turned away from the gates of Vienna.' 
 
 
FM Gul Visit To Austria:  "Milliyet" reports that foreign 
minister Gul received a warm welcome in Vienna, where he met 
with the Austrian PM and FM.  During the meetings, Gul gave 
details about Turkey's EU harmonization reforms recently 
approved by parliament.  "Radikal" reports that both Erdogan 
and Gul told their European counterparts Turkey's goal is to 
begin accession talks as soon as possible.  The paper  added 
that Ankara has accelerated its diplomatic efforts as the EU 
commission begins to review Turkey's EU entry bid. 
 
 
General Jones' Visit:  All papers report that General Jones 
arrived yesterday evening and will hold meetings with 
Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul and TGS Chief Ozkok today. 
"Milliyet" speculates that General Ozkok and General Jones 
will discuss the PKK/KADEK presence in Northern Iraq. 
"Turkiye" predicts that the Turkish side will urge General 
Jones step up efforts to eliminate the PKK threat in 
northern Iraq.  "Cumhuriyet" notes that Turkey is upset by 
the perceived unwillingness of the US to press for the 
return of PKK terrorists to Turkey within the framework of 
Turkey's repentance law.  Papers speculate that General 
Jones will specify which sector in Iraq could be handed over 
to Turkish troops. 
 
 
Remarks of Richard Holbrooke:  "Milliyet" reports on remarks 
by former USUN representative Richard Holbrooke.  In an 
interview with Fox TV, Holbrooke said that `the borders 
established for Iraq in 1922 were a mistake.  In 1991, he 
said, Presidents Bush and Ozal could have corrected this 
mistake, but chose not to do so.  As a result of the 
mistakes made in drawing up the map of Iraq, Holbrooke 
concluded, Iraq could didintegrate in the near future, and 
Iraq's neighbors - including Turkey -- could attempt to 
absorb various parts of the country.' 
 
 
PKK/KADEK:  "Milliyet" reports that the PKK, through its 
spokesman Mizgin Sen, announced that the cease-fire declared 
in 1999 has been ended.  The Interior Ministry  announced 
that the PKK/KADEK has established a new party called the 
`Demokratik Serhildan Party.' According to an Interior 
Ministry document, the party intends to prepare terrorist 
attacks in Turkey's large cities. 
 
 
 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION 
 
 
"We cannot remain indifferent to Iraq" 
Mehmet Ali Birand wrote in the mass appeal Posta (9/3): 
"There is a significant threat that Iraq might be dissolved 
into three parts. .  The possibility for establishing a 
democracy in Iraq under a single administration is growing 
ever weaker.  Turkey is obliged to intervene in Iraq. . 
Terrorism in the Middle East is now concentrated in Iraq. 
Turkey will either stand against terror or merely watch it. 
It might be too late when it hits us later. .  It is 
unlikely that the U.S. will withdraw from Iraq. .  It might 
take long years and come at a great cost, but the balances 
in the Middle East will definitely change." 
 
 
"The end of Denktas" 
Okay Gonensin noted in the mass appeal Vatan (9/3):  "For 
the past 40 years, Ankara has believed that there cannot be 
a Cyprus policy other than the one that has been pursued by 
Denktas.  The Greek Cypriots have advanced, in the political 
and economic sense, while the Turkish Cypriots remain as 
they were four decades ago. .  Cyprus has always remained a 
taboo in Turkey. .  Denktas recently said that if he is 
defeated in the Turkish Cypriot elections, he will launch a 
new struggle with the backing of the Turkish people.  His 
remarks are a clear indication that Turkish Cypriots, just 
like a significant part of the Turkish nation, do not 
support Denktas anymore. .  He is really acknowledging the 
mistakes that have been over the past 40 years."
