E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/13/2013 
TAGS: PARM PREL MNUC KNNP IT UNDC UNGA
SUBJECT: PSI: ITALY SETS INTERAGENCY REVIEW MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 231890 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR GARY ROBBINS FOR REA 
SONS 1.5(B)(D) 
 
¶1. (C) THE MFA WILL CHAIR AN INTERAGENCY MEETING AT THE END 
OF AUGUST TO REVIEW THE PROLIFERATION SECURITY INITIATIVE 
GENERALLY AND REFTEL DRAFT STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES IN 
PARTICULAR, ACCORDING TO FILIPPO FORMICA, DIRECTOR OF THE MFA 
DISARMAMENT AND ARMS CONTROL OFFICE. 
 
¶2. (S) FORMICA COMMENTED THAT THE CURRENT STATEMENT OF 
PRINCIPLES APPEARS MORE TARGETED AND STREAMLINED THAN THE 
LAST VERSION. HE AGREED THAT THERE IS VALUE IN MAKING THE 
INTERDICTION PRINCIPLES PUBLIC, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE 
INITIATIVE IS RECEIVING PRESS COVERAGE.  ITALY SUPPORTS 
OUTREACH ACTIVITIES IN THE FUTURE TO ENCOURAGE STRATEGIC 
COUNTRIES TO COOPERATE, HE SAID.  HOWEVER, IT WILL BE 
NECESSARY TO COORDINATE CAREFULLY WHICH COUNTRIES TO INCLUDE, 
HOW, AND FOR WHAT ACTIVITIES. 
 
¶3. (C) FORMICA NOTED THAT A BILATERAL OR MULTILATERAL 
AGREEMENT MAY BE NEEDED TO AUTHORIZE BOARDING OF ITALIAN 
VESSELS BY OTHER COUNTRIES, AS PROPOSED IN 4.C OF THE 
STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES.  WHERE SOVEREIGNTY ISSUES ARE 
INVOLVED, WE NEED TO STAY WITHIN EXISTING NATIONAL AND 
INTERNATIONAL LAW, HE SAID, ADDING THAT HE HAD SUBMITTED 
COMMENTS TO THIS EFFECT AT THE BRISBANE MEETING.  FORMICA 
ALSO SUGGESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO USE AN ISSUE ON 
THE UN FIRST COMMITTEE'S AGENDA TO BOLSTER THE PSI.  HE 
PROPOSED, AS AN EXAMPLE, INTEGRATING THE CONCEPT OF WMD 
INTERDICTION INTO EXISTING INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION WHICH 
CURRENTLY DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS WMD. 
 
¶4. (C) FORMICA ENCOURAGED THE USG TO CONSIDER ADDING THE EU 
AS A PSI PARTICIPANT.  ITALY, IN ITS CAPACITY AS EU 
PRESIDENT, PLANS TO DISCUSS THE PSI WITH OTHER EU MEMBERS AT 
THE SEPTEMBER 4 EU CONOPS MEETING BECAUSE SOME ISSUES, SUCH 
AS DUAL USE AND TRADE, FALL WITHIN THE DOMAIN OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMISSION, FORMICA SAID.  MORE INFORMATION ON EUROPEAN 
REGULATIONS GOVERNING THESE ISSUES COULD BE USEFUL IN 
DEVELOPING THE PSI, HE SAID.  THE EC ALREADY HAS SANCTIONED A 
FEW MEMBER STATES FOR REACHING BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH THE 
US ON CUSTOMS REGULATIONS THAT ARE WITHIN THE EC'S EXCLUSIVE 
COMPETENCY, HE SAID.  HE SUGGESTED INCLUDING IN THE ITALIAN 
DELEGATION AN EC REPRESENTATIVE WHO COULD DISCUSS EC DUAL USE 
AND TRADE REGULATIONS.  FORMICA STRESSED THAT ITALY WILL 
COORDINATE WITH THE USG ON HOW BEST TO ADDRESS EU AND EC 
INTEGRATION.
