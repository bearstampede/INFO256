¶3.  THE COMMISSION PROPOSAL TO REVISE CAP 
SUPPORT FOR THE RICE SECTOR IS LOWER THAN THE 
CURRENT LEVEL OF SUPPORT TO PRODUCERS, AND 
HENCE, NOT DESIRED BY ITALIAN AGRICULTURAL 
INTERESTS. THE REDUCED INTERVENTION PRICE, IN 
GOI TERMS, IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. WHILE THE GOI 
AGREES, IN PRINCIPLE, TO REDUCE THE 
INTERVENTION PRICE FOR RICE, THEY BELIEVE 
THAT THE LEVEL SHOULD GO TO EUROS 150 PER TON 
FOR PADDY RICE. 
 
¶4.  ITALY, THE LARGEST RICE PRODUCER IN THE 
EU, HAS SLIGHTLY SHIFTED RICE PRODUCTION BY 
ABOUT 5 PERCENT FROM INDICA VARIETIES TO MORE 
TRADITIONAL JAPONICA VARIETIES DUE TO IMPORT 
PRESSURE. FOR 2003 OVERALL RICE PRODUCTION 
    AREA IS UNCHANGED.  ANNUAL AGGREGATE 
PRODUCTION,  MILLED BASIS, IN THE PAST THREE 
YEARS HAS AVERAGED 850,000 TONS.
