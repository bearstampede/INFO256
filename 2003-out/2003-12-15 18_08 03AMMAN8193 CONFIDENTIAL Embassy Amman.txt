¶1.  (C)  PolCouns December 14 covered with Ali al-Ayed, 
Director of Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher's Private Office, 
ref points on a possible Palestinian challenge to Israeli 
credentials in the UNGA.  PolCouns asked that the GOJ try to 
convince the PA not to bring a credentials challenge and, 
failing that, to support a no-action motion on the 
Palestinian request.  Ayed said that a report from Jordan's 
mission to the UN indicated that the Palestinians had not yet 
decided to move ahead with a credentials challenge.  Ayed 
would not comment on how Jordan might vote on a no-action 
motion if the PA introduced a credentials challenge. 
 
¶2.  (C)  On December 15, Basheer Zoubi, Deputy Director of 
the Foreign Minister's Private Office (and the officer in 
charge of UN affairs for the Minister), told PolOff that 
while other Arab countries were prepared to sponsor the draft 
PA credentials challenge, Egypt and Jordan had held back, 
which prompted the Palestinians to withdraw their text to 
come up with new language.  Zoubi said that Jordan would 
continue to try and exert a "moderating" influence in 
inter-Arab negotiations on the credentials challenge, 
although Jordan would not on its own break consensus with the 
Arab group.
