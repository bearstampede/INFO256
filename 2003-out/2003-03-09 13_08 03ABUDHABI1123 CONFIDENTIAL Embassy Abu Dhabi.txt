SUBJECT: UAE POSTPONES HAWALA CONFERENCE 
 
REF:  ABU DHABI 619 
 
¶1.  CLASSIFIED BY DCM RICHARD A.ALBRIGHT FOR 
REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶2. (C)  In a meeting with Econchief 3/8 (other 
topics septel, notal), UAE Central Bank Governor 
Sultan bin Nasser Al-Suweidi stated that the 
planned Second International Conference on Hawala, 
scheduled for April 2-3 in Abu Dhabi, has been 
postponed.  A formal notification would be issued 
shortly, but the decision had already been taken 
owing to poor response (only 20 participants had 
signed up on the Central Bank's website and not all 
these were firm acceptances).  Econchief noted that 
the USG strongly supported the conference and had 
planned to participate with a sizable delegation. 
Al-Suweidi acknowledged this, but said that 
concerns about a likely conflict with Iraq had 
probably contributed to the lack of broader 
international support.  The conference could be 
rescheduled, should there be sufficient interest, 
at a later date -- he would consult further with 
the FATF. 
 
¶3.  (C)  With regard to the UAE's own regulations 
governing hawala, the Governor noted that now that 
approximately 30 hawaladars had come forward to 
register voluntarily, the UAE authorities are 
reaching out to those believed to be active in the 
business -- but who had not registered -- and 
"inviting" them to register.  Al-Suweidi observed 
that this process of "invitation" had only been 
necessary in a small number of cases; he was 
pleased that the vast majority of registrations had 
been purely voluntary.
