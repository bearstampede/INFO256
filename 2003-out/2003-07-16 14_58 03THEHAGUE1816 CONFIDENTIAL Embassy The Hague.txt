¶1.  (C) On July 16, PolOff and British PolCouns delivered 
reftel to MFA Adri van Loopik, head of the Gulf States 
Division.  Van Loopik congratulated the US, UK and UN on 
bringing together such a diverse and inclusive group to form 
the Governing Council.  The Dutch are encouraged by the 
actions taken to date by the CPA, and are impressed by the 
individuals that have been chosen to represent the Iraqi 
people on the GC.  Van Loopik further engaged PolOff and 
British PolCouns in a discussion of the powers the GC will 
hold.  When questioned if the GoNL would make a public 
statement in support of the GC, van Loopik cited timing 
difficulties because the FM is on leave.  However, he 
suggested the possibility of an EU statement, which the Dutch 
would fully support.  He commented that this issue may arise 
at the EU FM's meeting (GAERC) on July 21. 
 
¶2.  (C) Van Loopik also said that, with the departure of 
Dutch troops to Iraq in August, the Dutch Parliament will 
keep an even closer eye on the political and security 
developments in country.  Any information demonstrating an 
independent constitutional process would be welcomed by the 
Dutch Parliament and public.
