Classified By: A/DCM MARY B. MARSHALL FOR REASON 1.4 (B/D). 
 
¶1. (C) As reported reftel, the Deputy Secretary of State for 
Foreign Relations on November 28 undertook to have the MFA 
legal office provide appropriate points of contact for us to 
engage directly with government and non-government entities 
that have not yet provided comments on the signed Article 98 
agreement.  The MFA had requested the comments prior to 
recommending legislative ratification of the agreement. 
 
¶2. (C) After repeated calls to the Deputy Secretary's office, 
on December 23 we spoke with MFA Legal Adviser Jorge 
Santiago, who promised to provide us the list of contacts 
"early in January."  Embassy will then engage with them and 
urge prompt delivery of comments, so the MFA recommendation 
can move forward.
