COALITION REMAIN IN FIRM CONTROL OF THE PARLIAMENT.  DESPITE 
CONTINUED CRITICISM FROM THE CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION, 
THIS COALITION IS LIKELY TO ENDURE THROUGH ITS FULL TERM INTO 
THE 
SPRING OF 2006 (THE FIRST POST-WAR ITALIAN GOVERNMENT TO DO 
SO).  ITS MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT IS SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE THAT 
IT CAN WIN VOTES NOT ONLY ON CONTROVERSIAL DOMESTIC ISSUES, 
BUT ALSO ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES OF CONCERN TO THE US, SUCH 
AS THE DEPLOYMENT OF ITALIAN LAND FORCES TO AFGHANISTAN. 
THE PRIME MINISTER REMAINS PUBLICLY SUPPORTIVE OF U.S. 
POLICY, MOST NOTABLY IN HIS STATEMENTS CONCERNING POTENTIAL 
MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ.

¶4. (U) THE EU: GOI PREPARATIONS FOR ITS EU PRESIDENCY, 
FROM JULY THROUGH DECEMBER 2003, BEGAN TO DOMINATE ITALY'S 
FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITIES TOWARDS EUROPE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT 
RETURNED TO WORK IN SEPTEMBER.  ITALY IS PLAYING AN ACTIVE 
ROLE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION'S ONGOING CONVENTION.  WHETHER THE 
PRODUCT OF THIS PROCESS IS A "CONSTITUTION" AS SOME IN THE EU 
HAVE CALLED FOR, OR A LESS AMBITIOUS TREATY BASED DOCUMENT, 
THE GOI AGREES WITH ALMOST ALL ITS EU PARTNERS THAT IT MUST 
ADDRESS STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE EU'S INSTITUTIONS THAT WILL 
MAKE IT MORE DEMOCRATIC AND EFFICIENT, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF 
ENLARGEMENT.  THE ITALIANS ARE HOPING TO HAVE THE CONCLUDING 
SESSION OF AN INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE, PRESIDED OVER BY 
HEADS-OF-STATE, ADOPT THE FINAL DOCUMENT BY THE END OF ITS 
PRESIDENCY.   ITALY IS A STRONG PROMOTER OF ESDP.  NOW THAT 
BERLIN PLUS (NATO/ESDP COORDINATION) ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN 
AGREED BETWEEN NATO AND THE EU, ITALY CAN BE EXPECTED TO BE A 
MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE FIRST EU PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS IN 
MACEDONIA AND (POTENTIALLY) BOSNIA. 
 
¶5. (U) NATO-RUSSIA: ITALY IS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF 
IMPROVED NATO-RUSSIA TIES.  PM BERLUSCONI WAS THE MAIN DRIVER 
BEHIND THE MAY 27-28 NATO-RUSSIA ROME SUMMIT WHICH 
ESTABLISHED THE NATO-RUSSIA COUNCIL.  HE IS AN ACTIVE 
BOOSTER OF RUSSIA'S RAPPROCHEMENT WITH THE WEST.  ITALY PLAYS 
AN ACTIVE ROLE -- 
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE US AND OTHER KEY ALLIES -- IN 
SUPPORTING FINANCIALLY THE DESTRUCTION OF RUSSIAN CW, AND IS 
WEIGHING PROVISION OF SIMILAR SUPPORT FOR THE DECOMMISSIONING 
OF RUSSIAN NUCLEAR SUBMARINES.

¶6. (U) "IN TOGETHER, OUT TOGETHER" ARE WELCOME WORDS TO OUR 
GOI INTERLOCUTORS AT ALL 
LEVELS.  EUROPE, INCLUDING ITALY, IS TAKING MORE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS OWN BACKYARD BY TAKING OVER POLICING 
FUNCTIONS IN BOSNIA POST IPTF.  AS NOTED ABOVE, ITALY WILL BE 
A KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO THE FOLLOW-ON MISSION TO NATO'S TASK 
FORCE FOX. THE GOI CONTINUES TO PARTICIPATE IN SFOR AND KFOR 
(INCLUDING ANOTHER KFOR COMMAND STARTING OCTOBER 2002.) 
ITALY IS ALBANIA'S "BIGGEST BOOSTER," LARGEST BILATERAL 
DONOR, INVESTOR, PROVIDER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE, AND 
GENERAL BIG BROTHER.  THIS ENGAGEMENT HELPS PROVIDE A 
RELATIVELY STABLE ANCHOR IN A VOLATILE REGION. 
 
¶7. (U) ITALY'S PARTICIPATION IN PFP:  ITALY IS A STRONG 
SUPPORTER OF THE PFP PROGRAM, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON 
IMPROVING THE CAPABILITIES AND QUALITY OF PFP COUNTRIES IN SE 
EUROPE.  ITALY HAS CLOSE AND EXTENSIVE TIES WITH ALBANIA, 
CROATIA, ROMANIA, BULGARIA, FYROM, SLOVENIA AND SLOVAKIA AND

¶10. (U) NATO ENLARGEMENT: ALL THROUGHOUT 2002, ITALY HAS BEEN 
IN FAVOR OF A ROBUST NATO ENLARGEMENT, PARTICULARLY AFTER 
RUSSIAN CONCERNS ABOUT ENLARGEMENT WERE ADDRESSED.  THE 
ITALIANS FAVORED A "BALANCED ENLARGEMENT" OF NATO, ONE THAT 
WOULD INCLUDE ROMANIA AND BULGARIA.  ON DECEMBER 11, IN THE

LIGHT INFANTRY BATTALION (APPROXIMATELY 1000 SOLDIERS) TO 
SERVE AS A MANEUVER FORCE IN AFGHANISTAN BEGINNING IN MARCH,

COMBINED WITH CONCERN THAT POSSIBLE ACTION IN IRAQ COULD DRAG 
THE WORLD ECONOMY DOWN EVEN FURTHER, HAS COMPLICATED MATTERS. 
TAX REVENUES ARE DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY, WHILE THE GOI HAS FOUND 
IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CUT SPENDING. 
 
¶16. (SBU) THE 2003 BUDGET IS THEREFORE A DIFFICULT 
COMPROMISE.  FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI IS SEEKING TO COMBINE 
FISCAL STIMULUS (TO AVOID A FURTHER SERIOUS DOWNTURN) WITH 
SMALL CUTS IN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND POLITICALLY 
DIFFICULT CAPS ON REGIONAL AND MUNICIPAL SPENDING.  THE FACT 
THAT THIS BUDGET PLEASES ALMOST NO ONE MAY BE THE BEST 
ARGUMENT THAT THE PAIN IS FAIRLY DISTRIBUTED.

¶17. (U) FIGURES REGARDING THE PROPOSED ITALIAN DEFENSE BUDGET 
HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS TRANSMITTED BY 
GOI TO THE PARLIAMENT ON OCTOBER 2.  THE TOTAL MOD FUNDING 
REQUEST FOR FY 2003 IS USD 19.61 BILLION, UP 3.1 PERCENT (OR 
USD 590 MILLION) FROM THE MOD REQUEST FOR FY 2002.  IN OTHER 
TERMS, 2003 MOD APPROPRIATIONS AMOUNT TO 1.5% OF THE GDP, 
COMPARED TO 1.52% OF 2002.  THE DRAFT 2003 MOD BUDGET 
PROVIDES A 3.1 PERCENT INCREASE, BUT ASSUMING A 1.9 PERCENT 
INFLATION RATE IN 2003, THIS FIGURE REPRESENTS A MODEST 
INCREASE IN REAL TERMS OVER 2002.

MODERNIZATION PROJECTS (INVESTMENTS.) THE OPTIMAL 
DISTRIBUTION OF DEFENSE FUNCTION SPENDING IS 70 PERCENT FOR

IL-76 IN SUPPORT OF ISAF.  ITALY PROVIDED ITS ONLY CARRIER 
BATTLE GROUP TO SUPPORT COMBAT OPERATIONS IN THE NORTH 
ARABIAN SEA.  IT DEPLOYED MORE THAN 13 PERCENT OF ITS ENTIRE 
NAVAL FORCE FOR USE IN OEF.  THE "DE LA PENNE" GROUP (ONE 
DESTROYER AND ONE FRIGATE) RELIEVED THE CARRIER BATTLE GROUP 
ON MARCH 15, 2002.  THE ITALIAN FRIGATE "EURO" TRANSITED THE 
SUEZ CANAL ON MAY 8, 2002 TO RELIEVE BOTH COMBATANTS ON 
STATION.  CURRENTLY THE "EURO" IS STATIONED IN THE GULF OF 
OMAN WITH THE CANADIAN TG 50.04.  IT TOOK PART IN THE CAPTURE 
OF TWO ALLEGED AL QAEDA ELEMENTS ON JULY 13, 2002 (THE FIRST 
EPISODE OF EFFECTIVE LIO IN OEF.)  ITALY MOVED MORE THAN 
17,000 LBS. (27 CUBIC METERS) OF SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT FROM 
BRINDISI TO ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN ON MARCH 19, 2002. 
SUPPLIES/EQUIPMENT INCLUDED A FORKLIFT AND EQUIPMENT FROM THE 
WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP).  ON APRIL 18, 2002, ITALIAN AIR 
FORCE AIRCRAFT AND A SECURITY FORCE FROM THE CARABINIERI 
TRANSPORTED FORMER AFGHANISTAN KING MOHAMMED ZAHIR SHAH AND 
AIA LEADER HAMID KARZAI FROM ROME TO KABUL WITHOUT INCIDENT. 
 
¶23. (U) ITALY HAS ALREADY SENT 2,700 TROOPS IN SUPPORT OF 
OEF, IN DEPLOYMENTS THAT ARE NOW COMPLETED.  THE GOI IS NOW 
PREPARING FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF A 1,000 MAN ALPINI TASK FORCE 
INTO AFGHANISTAN IN MARCH 2003.  ITALY ALSO HAS 15 PERSONNEL 
DEPLOYED IN SUPPORT OF OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM IN THE 
COALITION COORDINATION CENTER (CCC) OF USCENTCOM AT MACDILL 
AFB, TAMPA, FL. 
 
¶24. (U) ITALY'S COMMITMENTS TO OEF AND ISAF HAVE COST IT USD 
170 MILLION AND USD 80 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  ADDITIONALLY, 
ITALY HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN THE FINANCIAL WAR ON TERRORISM, 
FREEZING ACCOUNTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES CONNECTED TO

TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  IN OCTOBER, ITALY BECAME ONLY THE SECOND 
COUNTRY WHICH JOINED THE U.S. IN JOINTLY DESIGNATING ENTITIES 
FOR ASSET FREEZE. 
 
25.(U) ITALY VOLUNTEERED TO SERVE AS THE LEAD NATION IN 
COORDINATING INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO ASSIST IN THE REFORM OF 
AFGHANISTAN'S JUDICIAL SECTOR, ONE OF FIVE AREAS OF REFORM 
CONTRIBUTING TO AFGHANISTAN'S LONG-TERM SECURITY.  IN THIS 
CAPACITY, THE GOI HAS SPONSORED A NUMBER OF MEETINGS AND 
HOSTED A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL DONOR CONFERENCE DECEMBER 19-20, 
AS WELL AS A SEMINAR FOR AFGHAN JURISTS DECEMBER 16-17.  GOI 
STAFF AT ITS KABUL EMBASSY INCREASED TO ENABLE IT TO FULFILL 
THIS ROLE, AS DID THE ALLOCATION OF PERSONNEL TO THE MFA'S 
AFGHANISTAN DESK.  ITALIAN ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN REACHED 
47.5 MILLION EURO AS OF LATE NOVEMBER.

MILITARY REFORM

¶26. (U) ITALY CONTINUES TO EXECUTE ITS PLAN TO ESTABLISH A 
PROFESSIONAL, ALL-VOLUNTEER FORCE.  THE GOI'S CURRENT TARGET 
IS A FULLY PROFESSIONAL FORCE OF 190,000 (APPROXIMATELY TEN 
PERCENT OF WHICH WILL BE WOMEN) BY THE END OF 2005.  DEFENSE 
MINISTER MARTINO HOPES TO HAVE THE PROFESSIONAL FORCE IN 
PLACE BY 2004 AS A COST-SAVING MEASURE.  LEGISLATION TO THAT 
EFFECT WAS INTRODUCED IN THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT IN MID-2002. 
 
¶27. (U) ARMY:  THE ITALIAN ARMY, WHICH CONSISTED OF 
APPROXIMATELY 120,000 PERSONNEL IN 2002, IS UNDERGOING 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AS IT STRIVES TO COMPLETE ITS TRANSITION

PAGE 04        ROME  00353  05 OF 12  291712Z 
TO A SMALLER, MORE DEPLOYABLE, AND COMPLETELY PROFESSIONAL 
FORCE.  APPROXIMATELY 60,000 CONSCRIPTS REMAIN IN SERVICE AS 
THE ARMY DOWNSIZES TO 112,000 VOLUNTEERS BY THE END OF 2005. 
WHILE 13 BRIGADES ARE STILL LISTED AS COMPRISING THE BULK OF 
FORCES, ONLY TEN BRIGADES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE FINAL 
STRUCTURE FOR CRISIS REACTION OR HOMELAND DEFENSE MISSIONS. 
THESE BRIGADES ARE EMPLOYED MUCH LIKE THE US ARMY'S 
DIVISIONS.  THEY ARE ALL ASSIGNED NATO MISSIONS AND MANY 
COULD ALSO BE USED BY THE EU.  A LITTLE OVER 6,500 ARMY 
PERSONNEL ARE DEPLOYED OVERSEAS, MOSTLY IN THE BALKANS, AND 
AFGHANISTAN.  MAJOR ISSUES ARE:  THE EXPANDING NUMBER OF 
PEACEKEEPING AND OTHER TYPES OF MULTINATIONAL OPERATIONS, THE 
COMPLETE INTEGRATION OF WOMEN INTO MOST  OF THE UNITS, AND 
ASSURING SUFFICIENT PERSONNEL ARE RECRUITED IN THE COMING 
YEARS.  IF THE CURRENT PACE OF RECRUITMENT CONTINUES, THE 
ARMY MAY BE SHORT 15,000 PERSONNEL IN 2006.  THIS SHORTFALL 
DOES NOT APPEAR TO UPSET THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP, AS IT WILL 
ALLOW FOR A MORE GRADUAL INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS. 
MEANWHILE, THE ITALIAN ARMY IS MOVING FORWARD IN IMPROVING 
ITS CAPABILITIES.  ITS NEWLY CREATED MULTINATIONAL CORPS

PAGE 02        ROME  00353  06 OF 12  291712Z 
NATO AS AN ALLIED RAPID DEPLOYABLE CORPS AND UNDERWENT FULL 
OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY TESTING WITH A MAJOR EXERCISE IN 
DECEMBER 2002.  THE ITALIAN ARMY ALSO CONTINUES TO ACQUIRE 
MODERN WEAPONS AND COMBAT VEHICLES SUCH AS THE ARIETE TANK 
AND THE DARDO ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER. 
 
¶28. (U) NAVY:  THE ITALIAN NAVY IS COMPRISED OF 34,000 MEN 
AND WOMEN.  THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE ITALIAN FLEET INCLUDE 
ONE AIRCRAFT CARRIER (HELICOPTERS AND AV-8B SEA HARRIERS), 
THREE AMPHIBIOUS SHIPS, APPROXIMATELY 25 FRIGATES/DESTROYERS, 
EIGHT DIESEL SUBMARINES, 10 PATROL BOATS, AND 10 
MINESWEEPERS.  CONSTRUCTION HAS BEGUN ON A LARGE AMPHIBIOUS 
SHIP,8 WHICH WILL BE CAPABLE OF ACTING AS A TROOP TRANSPORT 
AND ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO OPERATE  HELICOPTERS AND AV-8B 
SEA HARRIERS, AND, EVENTUALLY, V/STOL JSFS.  A TYPE 212 
SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM WILL 
WILL REPLACE OLDER SUBMARINES.  THE ITALIAN NAVY ALSO WANTS 
TO ENHANCE ITS AMPHIBIOUS CAPABILITY TO PROJECT POWER BY 
REFITTING ITS TWO LPDS, PROCURING NEW HELICOPTERS AND 
ENLARGING ITS SAN MARCO NAVAL INFANTRY GROUP.  IN 2002, THE 
ITALIANS CONTINUED CO-PRODUCTION, WITH THE FRENCH, OF THE 
HORIZON FRIGATE, A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO REPLACE SEVERAL OLDER 
FRIGATES.  THE ITALIANS HAVE A BILATERAL AMPHIBIOUS AGREEMENT 
WITH THE SPANISH NAVY, WHICH HAS LED TO THE CREATION OF A 
JOINT ITALIAN-SPANISH AMPHIBIOUS FORCE.  THEY ARE ALSO 
PROPOSING CREATION OF A NATO NAVAL HIGH READINESS FORCE USING 
ITALIAN UNITS AS THE CENTERPIECE. 
 
¶29. (U) AIR FORCE:  THE ITALIAN AIR FORCE PROVIDES 
SIGNIFICANT LOGISTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT TO THE US AND 
NATO FORCES.  HOWEVER, ITS ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE DIRECTLY IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  00353  06 OF 12  291712Z 
A FORCE-PROJECTION ROLE IS  MODEST.  THE PRIMARY MILITARY 
LIMITATIONS TO OUT OF AREA OPERATIONS OF THE ITALIAN AIR 
FORCE ARE: PROHIBITION OF THE USE OF CONSCRIPTS OVERSEAS, 
LACK OF STRATEGIC LIFT, AND LACK OF ADEQUATE AIR REFUELING 
SUPPORT FOR MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF AIRCRAFT.  ADDITIONALLY, 
IN THE SURFACE ATTACK ROLE, THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT 
INVENTORIES OF PRECISION GUIDED WEAPONS TO SUSTAIN A BOMBING 
CAMPAIGN OF MORE THAN A FEW DAYS.  HOWEVER, SINCE THE END OF 
THE GULF WAR, ITALY HAS MADE DRAMATIC GAINS IN IMPROVING ITS 
CONVENTIONAL WAR FIGHTING ABILITY.  ITALY HAS INCREASED ITS 
PURCHASE OF PRECISION WEAPONS, SIGNED CONTRACTS TO PURCHASE 
US-MADE AIR REFUELING AIRCRAFT, LEASED EX-US F-16 FALCONS (34 
F-16A/B AIRCRAFT TO ARRIVE IN CY2003 FOR USE IN AUGMENTING 
ITS FIGHTER INTERCEPTOR FORCE UNTIL THE EUROFIGHTER TYPHOON 
COMES ON LINE,) PURCHASED 24 C-130J AIRCRAFT, MODIFIED SOME 
TORNADO AIRCRAFT FOR SUPPRESSION OF ENEMY AIR DEFENSE ROLES 
AND INCREASED TRAINING OF TORNADO FLIGHT CREWS IN THE 
EMPLOYMENT OF LASER GUIDED MUNITIONS. 
 
¶30. (U) THE EUROFIGHTER TYPHOON IS THE LARGEST PROCUREMENT 
ITEM IN ITALY,S DEFENSE BUDGET.  ALTHOUGH IT ENTERS SERVICE 
IN 2004, IT WILL NOT REACH FULL OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY UNTIL 
2007 OR 2008.  UNTIL IT REACHES FULL OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY, 
IT WILL NOT GREATLY INCREASE ITALY'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE AIR 
SUPREMACY AND DEPLOYABILITY.  AS A RESULT, A LARGE PART OF 
ITALY,S AIR COMBAT POWER WILL RELY ON OBSOLETE F-104 
STARFIGHTER AIRCRAFT (TO BE REPLACED BY THE EUROFIGHTER 
TYPHOON) AND THE SURFACE ATTACK 
AIRCRAFT, THE JOINT BRAZILIAN-ITALIAN AMX.  ITALY WAS THE 
SECOND FOREIGN CUSTOMER TO SIGN A CONTRACT TO HELP FUND, 
DEVELOP AND MANUFACTURE THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER (JSF), AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  00353  06 OF 12  291712Z 
THE SIZE OF ITS PARTICIPATION MAKES IT THE SECOND LARGEST JSF 
PARTNER(AFTER THE UK).  ITALY PLANS ON TAKING DELIVERY OF ITS 
FIRST JSF IN 2012 AND WILL USE THE AIRCRAFT TO REPLACE ITS 
AMX AND TORNADO AIRCRAFT IN THE SURFACE ATTACK ROLE AND 
REPLACE ITS AV-8B,S ONBOARD THE CARRIER GARIBALDI AND ITS 
SUCCESSOR.  WITH ITALY,S REPLACEMENT OF THE F-104 BY THE 
TYPHOON AND THE REPLACEMENT OF THE AMX WITH THE JOINT STRIKE 
FIGHTER, ITS EMPLOYABLE COMBAT POWER WILL SIGNIFICANTLY 
INCREASE. 
 
¶31. (U) CARABINIERI:  THE CARABINIERI ARE, TECHNICALLY, THE 
FOURTH ELEMENT OF THE ITALIAN ARMED FORCES, AND REPORT TO THE 
MINISTER OF DEFENSE.  WHILE MOST CARABINIERI RESPONSIBILITIES 
ARE FOR DOMESTIC SECURITY AND POLICE, CARABINIERI FORCES PLAY 
A LEADING ROLE IN MSU OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, AFGHANISTAN, 
AND ARE IN MANY RESPECTS THE MODEL FOR INTERNATIONAL FORCES 
BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN MILITARY PEACEKEEPING AND CIVILIAN 
POLICING FUNCTIONS.  ADDITIONALLY, PURSUANT TO A 
LONG-STANDING AGREEMENT WITH THE US ARMY, ITALY PROVIDES TWO 
CARABINIERI COMPANIES ON A FULL-TIME BASIS TO THE US ARMY'S 
SOUTHERN EUROPEAN TASK FORCE TO ASSIST IN FORCE PROTECTION

ITALY'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMMON DEFENSE 
------------------------------------------ 
HOST NATION SUPPORT: 
 
¶32. (U) -- ITALY PROVIDES FOR USG USE OF SEVEN PRINCIPAL 
MILITARY BASES AND NUMEROUS SMALLER LOCATIONS, ALL ON A 
NO-FEE BASIS, A UNIQUELY ADVANTAGEOUS ARRANGEMENT FOR THE US 
DEFENSE BUDGET.   THESE STRATEGICALLY LOCATED INSTALLATIONS 
PERMIT A FORMIDABLE US FORCE CAPABILITY VIA THREE AIRBASES, 
ONE STAGING BASE, ONE LARGE AMMUNITION AND EQUIPMENT BASE AND 
TWO HOMEPORTS - ONE WITH THE ONLY ATLANTIC REGION 
MAINTENANCE/REPAIR TENDER SHIP PRIMARILY FOR NUCLEAR POWERED 
SUBMARINES.  US FLEET AND SUBMARINE OPERATIONS IN THE 
MEDITERRANEAN WOULD BE SERIOUSLY HAMPERED WITHOUT THIS 
CAPABILITY. 
-- ITALIAN CIVIL AND MILITARY SECURITY FORCES PROVIDE 
INVALUABLE ANTI-TERRORIST PROTECTION TO US SHIPS TRANSITING 
ITALIAN PORTS AND MILITARY BASES UTILIZED BY USG ALONG WITH 
ARMED CARABINIERI SECURITY OF SENIOR US OFFICERS STATIONED OR 
TRANSITING ITALY AND OTHER DIGNITARIES, AS NECESSARY. 
-- A ROBUST TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCES US 
MILITARY DATA AND VOICE TRANSMISSION WHILE REDUCING 
REQUIREMENTS FOR US MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL THROUGH 
A SUSTAINED AVAILABILITY OF LEASED TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
CIRCUITS. 
-- HOST NATION ASSURANCES FOR SAFE LINES OF COMMUNICATIONS 
(AIRPORTS, SEA PORTS, RAILWAYS, HIGHWAYS, AIR ROUTES) 
FACILITATE THE SURGE OF US MILITARY PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT

DURING TIMES OF CRISIS OR CONFLICT THROUGH THREE SHARED 
CIVILIAN/MILITARY AIRFIELDS WITH BASING OF US AIRCRAFT. 
-- UNPARALLELED AUTHORIZATION OF A US/NATO MUNITIONS STORAGE 
FACILITIES ON ITALIAN SOIL PERMITS INVALUABLE SOURCE FOR A 
PRE-POSITIONED STAGING MUNITIONS CAPABILITY TO EXERCISES AND 
CONTINGENCIES INCLUDING THE WAR ON TERRORISM. 
-- CONVENIENT ACCESS TO MILITARY TRAINING AND EXERCISE RANGES 
ALLOWS THE US MILITARY TO CONDUCT INDISPENSABLE LAND MANEUVER 
EXERCISES, LIVE-FIRE TRAINING, PARACHUTING, AND AIR TRAINING 
ACTIVITIES. 
-- NO-COST LOAN OF 16 ITALIAN ARMY "CENTAURO" WHEELED ARMORED 
VEHICLES TO THE US ARMY SIGNIFICANTLY AIDED THE 
TRANSFORMATION OF NEW INTERIM BRIGADE COMBAT TEAMS TO DEVELOP 
OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS, TACTICS AND PROCEDURES FOR A MOBILE GUN 
SYSTEM. 
-- ITALY HAS BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO SECURITY CONCERNS AS 
EXEMPLIFIED WITH A 10-20 PERCENT INCREASE OF ARMED FORCES TO 
SUPPLEMENT US AND CONTRACT GUARD PERSONNEL RESPONSIBLE FOR 
PERIMETER SECURITY OF US/NATO-UTILIZED INSTALLATIONS. 
-- PROVIDED ADDITIONAL VALUABLE LAND IN SUPPORT OF THE F-16 
BEDDOWN AT AVIANO AIR BASE. 
DEFENSE SPENDING: 
 
¶33. (U) -- ITALIAN CONTRIBUTION TO BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL 
COOPERATIVE PROGRAMS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW WEAPON 
SYSTEMS HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF OUTSTANDING.  THEIR 
PARTICIPATION REDUCES UNIT COSTS WHILE BOLSTERING A VITAL US 
DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASE AS EXEMPLIFIED THROUGH THE JOINT 
STRIKE FIGHTER PROGRAM (JSF), MEDIUM EXTENDED AIR DEFENSE 
SYSTEM, MINI-INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, F-16 FIGHTER 
AIRCRAFT LEASE, LIGHTWEIGHT 155MM HOWITZER DEVELOPMENT, AND

-- DIRECT PROCUREMENT OF US MANUFACTURED MAJOR DEFENSE 
EQUIPMENT PROMOTES AMERICAN PRODUCTS AND INTEROPERABILITY 
WHILE LENGTHENING AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTION LINES AND 
PRESERVING A US INDUSTRIAL BASE AS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH THE 
PURCHASE OF 200 LOCKHEED-MARTIN JSF AIRCRAFT, FIVE GENERAL 
ATOMICS PREDATOR UNMANNED ARIEL VEHICLES, AND LARGE-SCALE 
PURCHASES OF FIVE TYPES OF RAYTHEON MISSILES. 
-- ITALY AGGRESSIVELY PROCURES US-BASED TRAINING VALUED AT 
OVER 60 MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR IN ORDER TO TRAIN ITS 
MILITARY PERSONNEL.  THIS IMMENSE EXPENDITURE SUBSIDIZES 
OPERATING COSTS AND HELPS SUSTAIN US MILITARY ACADEMIC 
INSTITUTIONS.

ICAO PROCEDURES AND MARITIME LAW AND IS RESPONSIVE TO BOTH 
MILITARY AND CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT AND SHIPS. 
-- THE CAPABILITY OF AN IMPRESSIVE ITALIAN AIR FORCE 
SUPPRESSION ENEMY AIR DEFENSE (SEAD) SYSTEM PLAYS A VITAL 
ROLE FOR THE PLANNING OF COMBINED AIR OPERATIONS AGAINST US 
AND NATO ADVERSARIES. 
-- ORCHESTRATION OF ITALIAN AIR OPERATIONS CREATES A

¶35. (U) UNDER ARTICLE VIII, PARAGRAPH 5 OF THE NATO SOFA, 
ITALY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING 25 PERCENT OF ALL NATO SOFA 
CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF DOD PERSONNEL IN 
THE PERFORMANCE OF OFFICIAL DUTY.  DURING CY02, ITALY'S 25 
PERCENT SHARE OF ALL NATO SOFA CLAIMS PAID ON BEHALF OF THE 
UNITED STATES WAS APPROXIMATELY 705,000 USD.  THIS FIGURE 
INCLUDES ITALY'S 650,000 USD SHARE OF A 2.6 MILLION USD 
JUDGMENT ENTERED IN CY02 BY AN ITALIAN COURT THAT REFLECTS 
PARTIAL PAYMENT OF A PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIM ARISING OUT OF THE 
FEBRUARY 1998 USMC AIR MISHAP AT CAVALESE (CERMIS). 
ADDITIONALLY, ITALY PROVIDES NATO SOFA CLAIMS ADJUDICATION 
AND LITIGATION DEFENSE SERVICES IN ITALIAN COURT AT NO COST 
TO THE UNITED STATES.  DURING CY02, THE VALUE OF THESE 
SERVICES WAS APPROXIMATELY 500,000 USD. 
 
¶36. (U) PURSUANT TO A 1982 MOU BETWEEN ITALY AND THE UNITED 
STATES, ITALY PERMITS DOD TO CONDUCT RADIO AND TELEVISION 
BROADCASTING SERVICES TO US DOD PERSONNEL STATIONED IN ITALY. 
 AT PRESENT, ITALY PROVIDES 36 FREQUENCIES AT NO COST TO THE 
UNITED STATES TO SUPPORT DOD'S IN-COUNTRY TERRESTRIAL 
BROADCAST OPERATIONS.  BASED ON QUOTES OBTAINED IN CY02 BY 
DOD'S AMERICAN FORCES NETWORK SOUTH (AFNS) TO PURCHASE OR 
LEASE ADDITIONAL FREQUENCIES IN CASES WHERE NEEDED 
FREQUENCIES COULD NOT BE OBTAINED FROM THE ITALIAN 
GOVERNMENT, WE ESTIMATE THE ANNUAL LEASE COST, ON THE OPEN 
MARKET, FOR AFNS'S EXISTING 36 FREQUENCIES WOULD BE 2.5 
MILLION USD.

¶37. (U) -- RECOGNITION OF ITALY,S CONTRIBUTION TO COMMON 
DEFENSE IS BEST ILLUSTRATED THROUGH NO-COST SAVINGS FOR THE 
RENTAL OR LEASE PROPERTY TO US FORCES, UTILIZATION OF FIXED 
STRUCTURES, UTILITY CONNECTIONS TO BASE PERIMETERS (ALTHOUGH 
THE US PAYS LOCAL ACCESS FEES,) EXTERNAL SECURITY FOR 
INSTALLATIONS, AND TRAINING RANGES. 
-- USG COST SAVINGS OF RENTAL OR LEASE OF PROPERTY ARE 
MAXIMIZED THROUGH CLOSE COORDINATION AND COOPERATION OF 
US/GOI MIXED COMMISSION BOARD. 
-- HIGHLIGHTS OF NO-COST SAVINGS BENEFITS ARE REFLECTED 
THROUGH A FAIR MARKET VALUE COMPARISON OF SIMILAR PROPERTIES 
SOLD IN 2002.  USING THIS COMPARISON, THE USG SAVED A TOTAL 
OF ABOUT 8.8 MILLION DOLLARS IN 2002 IN FOREGONE RENT. 
-- NO-COST SAVINGS ARE FURTHER BROKEN DOWN INTO RESPECTIVE 
MILITARY SERVICES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE TREMENDOUS BENEFIT: 
USNAVEUR HAS ACCESS TO 4 SITES THAT ENCOMPASS 577 ACRES OF 
LAND, USAREUR UTILIZES 10 SITES COMPRISED OF 3,184 ACRES, AND

IMPORTS INTO ITALY FOR OFFICIAL/INSTITUTIONAL PURCHASES, 
INCLUDING PERSONAL PROPERTY DOD PERSONNEL SHIP UNDER DOD 
TRAVEL ORDERS WHEN ENTERING COUNTRY ON PCS OR TDY/TAD. 
ADDITIONALLY, APPROXIMATELY 220 MILLION USD OF GOODS AND

STATEMENT OF THE INCREASE TO 0.7 PERCENT OF GDP IT IS 
UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT THAT ITALY WILL EVER BE ABLE TO KEEP UP 
WITH THE NORTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHICH MEET AND EXCEED 
OECD TARGETS. ITALY,S LIMITED FOREIGN ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE

ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.  BILATERAL ASSISTANCE (PROVIDED BY THE 
MINISTRIES OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TREASURY) FOR 2002 (REVISED 
BUDGET) WAS USD 475 MILLION, BUT THE 2003 BUDGET CALLS FOR A 
2.7 PERCENT INCREASE TO USD 488 MILLION, 0.1 PERCENT OF TOTAL 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING, THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF 2000 AND 2001. 
 
¶43. (U) ITALY PREFERS, WHEN POSSIBLE, TO WORK THROUGH 
MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS TO MANAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, 
RATHER THAN SELF-MANAGE AS USAID DOES.  ITALIAN BILATERAL 
ASSISTANCE IS ALWAYS IN THE FORM OF PROJECTS, RATHER THAN 
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS FINANCING OR CASH.  ITALY RARELY FUNDS AN 
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT, AND IS MOSTLY INTERESTED IN 
ENVIRONMENT, AGRICULTURE, AND EDUCATION.  RECIPIENT COUNTRIES 
PROPOSE PROJECTS, WHICH ARE THEN CONSIDERED BY THE FOREIGN 
MINISTRY FOR FUNDING.  ON THE GROUND, ITALIAN AID WORKERS 
COLLABORATE (WHICH DOES NOT IMPLY THEY ALWAYS AGREE) WITH 
THEIR COUNTERPARTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES TO ENSURE THAT 
OVERALL AID PROJECTS WORK WELL.  IN ROUGHLY TWENTY RECIPIENT 
COUNTRIES OF BILATERAL ASSISTANCE, ITALY USES 'TECHNICAL 
LOCAL UNITS' WHICH CONSIST OF ONE OR TWO ITALIANS AND OTHER 
LOCAL STAFF.  THESE UNITS ARE HEADQUARTERED WITHIN ITALIAN 
EMBASSIES ABROAD.  IN OTHER COUNTRIES, PROGRAMS ARE OVERSEEN 
DIRECTLY BY THE EMBASSY, WITHOUT THE HELP OF A TECHNICAL 
LOCAL UNIT. 
 
¶44. (U) FOLLOWING THE MONTERREY CONFERENCE IN JULY IN THE 
2003-2006 BUDGET PLANNING DOCUMENT THE GOI TOOK THE 
COMMITMENT TO INCREASE THROUGH 2003 THE AID/GDP RATIO TO 0.33 
PERCENT. THIS COMMITMENT, LIKE THAT ON DEFENSE, CONFLICTS 
WITH THE CONSTRAINTS RELATED TO THE CRITICAL BUDGET SITUATION.

COALITION REMAIN IN FIRM CONTROL OF THE PARLIAMENT.  DESPITE 
CONTINUED CRITICISM FROM THE CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION, 
THIS COALITION IS LIKELY TO ENDURE THROUGH ITS FULL TERM INTO 
THE 
SPRING OF 2006 (THE FIRST POST-WAR ITALIAN GOVERNMENT TO DO 
SO).  ITS MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT IS SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE THAT 
IT CAN WIN VOTES NOT ONLY ON CONTROVERSIAL DOMESTIC ISSUES, 
BUT ALSO ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES OF CONCERN TO THE US, SUCH 
AS THE DEPLOYMENT OF ITALIAN LAND FORCES TO AFGHANISTAN. 
THE PRIME MINISTER REMAINS PUBLICLY SUPPORTIVE OF U.S. 
POLICY, MOST NOTABLY IN HIS STATEMENTS CONCERNING POTENTIAL 
MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ.

¶4. (U) THE EU: GOI PREPARATIONS FOR ITS EU PRESIDENCY, 
FROM JULY THROUGH DECEMBER 2003, BEGAN TO DOMINATE ITALY'S 
FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITIES TOWARDS EUROPE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT 
RETURNED TO WORK IN SEPTEMBER.  ITALY IS PLAYING AN ACTIVE 
ROLE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION'S ONGOING CONVENTION.  WHETHER THE 
PRODUCT OF THIS PROCESS IS A "CONSTITUTION" AS SOME IN THE EU 
HAVE CALLED FOR, OR A LESS AMBITIOUS TREATY BASED DOCUMENT, 
THE GOI AGREES WITH ALMOST ALL ITS EU PARTNERS THAT IT MUST 
ADDRESS STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE EU'S INSTITUTIONS THAT WILL 
MAKE IT MORE DEMOCRATIC AND EFFICIENT, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF 
ENLARGEMENT.  THE ITALIANS ARE HOPING TO HAVE THE CONCLUDING 
SESSION OF AN INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE, PRESIDED OVER BY 
HEADS-OF-STATE, ADOPT THE FINAL DOCUMENT BY THE END OF ITS 
PRESIDENCY.   ITALY IS A STRONG PROMOTER OF ESDP.  NOW THAT 
BERLIN PLUS (NATO/ESDP COORDINATION) ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN 
AGREED BETWEEN NATO AND THE EU, ITALY CAN BE EXPECTED TO BE A 
MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE FIRST EU PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS IN 
MACEDONIA AND (POTENTIALLY) BOSNIA. 
 
¶5. (U) NATO-RUSSIA: ITALY IS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF 
IMPROVED NATO-RUSSIA TIES.  PM BERLUSCONI WAS THE MAIN DRIVER 
BEHIND THE MAY 27-28 NATO-RUSSIA ROME SUMMIT WHICH 
ESTABLISHED THE NATO-RUSSIA COUNCIL.  HE IS AN ACTIVE 
BOOSTER OF RUSSIA'S RAPPROCHEMENT WITH THE WEST.  ITALY PLAYS 
AN ACTIVE ROLE -- 
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE US AND OTHER KEY ALLIES -- IN 
SUPPORTING FINANCIALLY THE DESTRUCTION OF RUSSIAN CW, AND IS 
WEIGHING PROVISION OF SIMILAR SUPPORT FOR THE DECOMMISSIONING 
OF RUSSIAN NUCLEAR SUBMARINES.

GOI INTERLOCUTORS AT ALL 
LEVELS.  EUROPE, INCLUDING ITALY, IS TAKING MORE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS OWN BACKYARD BY TAKING OVER POLICING 
FUNCTIONS IN BOSNIA POST IPTF.  AS NOTED ABOVE, ITALY WILL BE 
A KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO THE FOLLOW-ON MISSION TO NATO'S TASK 
FORCE FOX. THE GOI CONTINUES TO PARTICIPATE IN SFOR AND KFOR 
(INCLUDING ANOTHER KFOR COMMAND STARTING OCTOBER 2002.) 
ITALY IS ALBANIA'S "BIGGEST BOOSTER," LARGEST BILATERAL 
DONOR, INVESTOR, PROVIDER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE, AND 
GENERAL BIG BROTHER.  THIS ENGAGEMENT HELPS PROVIDE A 
RELATIVELY STABLE ANCHOR IN A VOLATILE REGION. 
 
¶7. (U) ITALY'S PARTICIPATION IN PFP:  ITALY IS A STRONG 
SUPPORTER OF THE PFP PROGRAM, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON 
IMPROVING THE CAPABILITIES AND QUALITY OF PFP COUNTRIES IN SE 
EUROPE.  ITALY HAS CLOSE AND EXTENSIVE TIES WITH ALBANIA, 
CROATIA, ROMANIA, BULGARIA, FYROM, SLOVENIA AND SLOVAKIA AND 
REGULARLY CONDUCTS BILATERAL MILITARY TALKS.  DURING THE 
CURRENT ROUND OF NATO ENLARGEMENT, ITALY SOUGHT TO HAVE

BETWEEN ITALIAN ALPINI TROOPS AND MOUNTAIN UNITS FROM 
MACEDONIA, SLOVENIA, AND ROMANIA.  ITALIAN DIVERS AND

BERLUSCONI HAS INDICATED THAT STRENGTHENING THE DIALOGUE WILL 
BE A GOI PRIORITY DURING ITALY'S EU PRESIDENCY IN 2003. 
 
¶10. (U) NATO ENLARGEMENT: ALL THROUGHOUT 2002, ITALY HAS BEEN 
IN FAVOR OF A ROBUST NATO ENLARGEMENT, PARTICULARLY AFTER 
RUSSIAN CONCERNS ABOUT ENLARGEMENT WERE ADDRESSED.  THE 
ITALIANS FAVORED A "BALANCED ENLARGEMENT" OF NATO, ONE THAT 
WOULD INCLUDE ROMANIA AND BULGARIA.  ON DECEMBER 11, IN THE 
PLENARY SESSION OF THE SOUTHEAST EUROPEAN DEFENSE MINISTERS, 
MINISTER MARTINO EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF ALBANIA, 
CROATIA, AND MACEDONIA SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF FUTURE NATO

MILITARY ASSETS FOR OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM.  THE GOI 
OFFERED A SUBSTANTIAL PACKAGE CONSISTING OF HER SOLE AIRCRAFT 
CARRIER, 8 HARRIER AIRCRAFT, EIGHT HELICOPTERS, TWO FRIGATES, 
A SUPPLY SHIP, 8 TORNADO AIRCRAFT, AN NBC UNIT, SIX EOD 
TEAMS, ONE ENGINEER UNIT, AND AN ARMOURED REGIMENT WITH 
EQUIPMENT.  NOT ALL ASSETS WERE CALLED UPON, HOWEVER THE 
AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND FRIGATES WERE AMONG THOSE THAT OPERATED 
IN THEATER FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. ITALY'S PARLIAMENT VOTED 
OVERWHELMINGLY IN NOVEMBER 2001 TO APPROVE ITALIAN 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO OEF, AND AGAIN IN OCTOBER 2002 WHEN 
ADDITIONAL ASSETS WERE MADE AVAILABLE.  THE GOI HAS ALSO 
OFFERED TO BACKFILL US TROOPS SERVING WITH NATO MISSIONS IN 
THE BALKANS AS ANOTHER MEANS OF SUPPORTING OEF. 
 
¶12. (U) THE GOI RECENTLY AGREED TO OUR REQUEST TO DEPLOY A 
LIGHT INFANTRY BATTALION (APPROXIMATELY 1000 SOLDIERS) TO 
SERVE AS A MANEUVER FORCE IN AFGHANISTAN BEGINNING IN MARCH, 
¶2003.  AT THAT POINT, ITALY WILL BE SECOND ONLY TO THE US IN 
GROUND FORCES AND TOTAL FORCES COMMITTED TO OEF.  IN 
ADDITION, TWO ITALIAN C-130J AIRCRAFT BEGAN OPERATING OUT OF 
MANAS AIR BASE IN OCTOBER.

ESTIMATED 0.3 PERCENT IN 2002 AND 1.5 PERCENT IN 2003, WAS 
SLIGHTLY BELOW THE AVERAGE OF THE 12 MEMBER STATES OF THE 
EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNIONS (EMU). 
 
¶14. (U) THE GOI PRESENTED ITS 2003 BUDGET TO PARLIAMENT ON 
OCTOBER 2.  REVISIONS ARE EXPECTED BEFORE PARLIAMENT APPROVES 
THE BUDGET IN LATE DECEMBER.  THE 2003 BUDGET TOTALS USD 
639.7 BILLION (OR 49.0 PERCENT OF GDP), WITH A DEFICIT OF USD 
19.6 BILLION (OR 1.5 PERCENT OF GDP.) A PACKAGE OF USD 20 
BILLION (OR 1.5 PERCENT OF GDP) IN SPENDING CUTS IS PARTLY 
OFFSET BY A STIMULUS PACKAGE OF USD 7.5 BILLION (OR 0.4

COMBINED WITH CONCERN THAT POSSIBLE ACTION IN IRAQ COULD DRAG 
THE WORLD ECONOMY DOWN EVEN FURTHER, HAS COMPLICATED MATTERS. 
TAX REVENUES ARE DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY, WHILE THE GOI HAS FOUND 
IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CUT SPENDING. 
 
¶16. (SBU) THE 2003 BUDGET IS THEREFORE A DIFFICULT 
COMPROMISE.  FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI IS SEEKING TO COMBINE 
FISCAL STIMULUS (TO AVOID A FURTHER SERIOUS DOWNTURN) WITH 
SMALL CUTS IN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND POLITICALLY 
DIFFICULT CAPS ON REGIONAL AND MUNICIPAL SPENDING.  THE FACT 
THAT THIS BUDGET PLEASES ALMOST NO ONE MAY BE THE BEST

INCREASE IN REAL TERMS OVER 2002.

MODERNIZATION PROJECTS (INVESTMENTS.) THE OPTIMAL 
DISTRIBUTION OF DEFENSE FUNCTION SPENDING IS 70 PERCENT FOR 
THE FUNCTIONING OF DEFENSE AND 30 PERCENT FOR DEFENSE 
MODERNIZATION.  THE 2003 BUDGET DEVOTES 76.1 PERCENT OF 
OVERALL DEFENSE FUNCTION SPENDING FOR DEFENSE OPERATIONS

IL-76 IN SUPPORT OF ISAF.  ITALY PROVIDED ITS ONLY CARRIER 
BATTLE GROUP TO SUPPORT COMBAT OPERATIONS IN THE NORTH 
ARABIAN SEA.  IT DEPLOYED MORE THAN 13 PERCENT OF ITS ENTIRE 
NAVAL FORCE FOR USE IN OEF.  THE "DE LA PENNE" GROUP (ONE 
DESTROYER AND ONE FRIGATE) RELIEVED THE CARRIER BATTLE GROUP 
ON MARCH 15, 2002.  THE ITALIAN FRIGATE "EURO" TRANSITED THE 
SUEZ CANAL ON MAY 8, 2002 TO RELIEVE BOTH COMBATANTS ON 
STATION.  CURRENTLY THE "EURO" IS STATIONED IN THE GULF OF 
OMAN WITH THE CANADIAN TG 50.04.  IT TOOK PART IN THE CAPTURE 
OF TWO ALLEGED AL QAEDA ELEMENTS ON JULY 13, 2002 (THE FIRST 
EPISODE OF EFFECTIVE LIO IN OEF.)  ITALY MOVED MORE THAN 
17,000 LBS. (27 CUBIC METERS) OF SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT FROM 
BRINDISI TO ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN ON MARCH 19, 2002. 
SUPPLIES/EQUIPMENT INCLUDED A FORKLIFT AND EQUIPMENT FROM THE 
WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP).  ON APRIL 18, 2002, ITALIAN AIR 
FORCE AIRCRAFT AND A SECURITY FORCE FROM THE CARABINIERI 
TRANSPORTED FORMER AFGHANISTAN KING MOHAMMED ZAHIR SHAH AND 
AIA LEADER HAMID KARZAI FROM ROME TO KABUL WITHOUT INCIDENT. 
 
¶23. (U) ITALY HAS ALREADY SENT 2,700 TROOPS IN SUPPORT OF 
OEF, IN DEPLOYMENTS THAT ARE NOW COMPLETED.  THE GOI IS NOW 
PREPARING FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF A 1,000 MAN ALPINI TASK FORCE 
INTO AFGHANISTAN IN MARCH 2003.  ITALY ALSO HAS 15 PERSONNEL 
DEPLOYED IN SUPPORT OF OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM IN THE 
COALITION COORDINATION CENTER (CCC) OF USCENTCOM AT MACDILL 
AFB, TAMPA, FL. 
 
¶24. (U) ITALY'S COMMITMENTS TO OEF AND ISAF HAVE COST IT USD 
170 MILLION AND USD 80 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  ADDITIONALLY, 
ITALY HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN THE FINANCIAL WAR ON TERRORISM, 
FREEZING ACCOUNTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES CONNECTED TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  00353  05 OF 12  291712Z 
TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  IN OCTOBER, ITALY BECAME ONLY THE SECOND 
COUNTRY WHICH JOINED THE U.S. IN JOINTLY DESIGNATING ENTITIES 
FOR ASSET FREEZE. 
 
25.(U) ITALY VOLUNTEERED TO SERVE AS THE LEAD NATION IN 
COORDINATING INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO ASSIST IN THE REFORM OF 
AFGHANISTAN'S JUDICIAL SECTOR, ONE OF FIVE AREAS OF REFORM 
CONTRIBUTING TO AFGHANISTAN'S LONG-TERM SECURITY.  IN THIS 
CAPACITY, THE GOI HAS SPONSORED A NUMBER OF MEETINGS AND 
HOSTED A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL DONOR CONFERENCE DECEMBER 19-20, 
AS WELL AS A SEMINAR FOR AFGHAN JURISTS DECEMBER 16-17.  GOI 
STAFF AT ITS KABUL EMBASSY INCREASED TO ENABLE IT TO FULFILL 
THIS ROLE, AS DID THE ALLOCATION OF PERSONNEL TO THE MFA'S 
AFGHANISTAN DESK.  ITALIAN ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN REACHED 
47.5 MILLION EURO AS OF LATE NOVEMBER.

MILITARY REFORM 
--------------- 
 
¶26. (U) ITALY CONTINUES TO EXECUTE ITS PLAN TO ESTABLISH A 
PROFESSIONAL, ALL-VOLUNTEER FORCE.  THE GOI'S CURRENT TARGET 
IS A FULLY PROFESSIONAL FORCE OF 190,000 (APPROXIMATELY TEN 
PERCENT OF WHICH WILL BE WOMEN) BY THE END OF 2005.  DEFENSE 
MINISTER MARTINO HOPES TO HAVE THE PROFESSIONAL FORCE IN 
PLACE BY 2004 AS A COST-SAVING MEASURE.  LEGISLATION TO THAT 
EFFECT WAS INTRODUCED IN THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT IN MID-2002. 
 
¶27. (U) ARMY:  THE ITALIAN ARMY, WHICH CONSISTED OF 
APPROXIMATELY 120,000 PERSONNEL IN 2002, IS UNDERGOING 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AS IT STRIVES TO COMPLETE ITS TRANSITION 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  00353  05 OF 12  291712Z 
TO A SMALLER, MORE DEPLOYABLE, AND COMPLETELY PROFESSIONAL 
FORCE.  APPROXIMATELY 60,000 CONSCRIPTS REMAIN IN SERVICE AS 
THE ARMY DOWNSIZES TO 112,000 VOLUNTEERS BY THE END OF 2005. 
WHILE 13 BRIGADES ARE STILL LISTED AS COMPRISING THE BULK OF 
FORCES, ONLY TEN BRIGADES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE FINAL 
STRUCTURE FOR CRISIS REACTION OR HOMELAND DEFENSE MISSIONS. 
THESE BRIGADES ARE EMPLOYED MUCH LIKE THE US ARMY'S 
DIVISIONS.  THEY ARE ALL ASSIGNED NATO MISSIONS AND MANY 
COULD ALSO BE USED BY THE EU.  A LITTLE OVER 6,500 ARMY 
PERSONNEL ARE DEPLOYED OVERSEAS, MOSTLY IN THE BALKANS, AND 
AFGHANISTAN.  MAJOR ISSUES ARE:  THE EXPANDING NUMBER OF 
PEACEKEEPING AND OTHER TYPES OF MULTINATIONAL OPERATIONS, THE 
COMPLETE INTEGRATION OF WOMEN INTO MOST  OF THE UNITS, AND 
ASSURING SUFFICIENT PERSONNEL ARE RECRUITED IN THE COMING 
YEARS.  IF THE CURRENT PACE OF RECRUITMENT CONTINUES, THE 
ARMY MAY BE SHORT 15,000 PERSONNEL IN 2006.  THIS SHORTFALL 
DOES NOT APPEAR TO UPSET THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP, AS IT WILL 
ALLOW FOR A MORE GRADUAL INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS. 
MEANWHILE, THE ITALIAN ARMY IS MOVING FORWARD IN IMPROVING 
ITS CAPABILITIES.  ITS NEWLY CREATED MULTINATIONAL CORPS 
LEVEL HIGH READINESS FORCE (LAND) HEADQUARTERS WAS OFFERED TO

NATO AS AN ALLIED RAPID DEPLOYABLE CORPS AND UNDERWENT FULL 
OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY TESTING WITH A MAJOR EXERCISE IN 
DECEMBER 2002.  THE ITALIAN ARMY ALSO CONTINUES TO ACQUIRE 
MODERN WEAPONS AND COMBAT VEHICLES SUCH AS THE ARIETE TANK 
AND THE DARDO ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER. 
 
¶28. (U) NAVY:  THE ITALIAN NAVY IS COMPRISED OF 34,000 MEN 
AND WOMEN.  THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE ITALIAN FLEET INCLUDE 
ONE AIRCRAFT CARRIER (HELICOPTERS AND AV-8B SEA HARRIERS), 
THREE AMPHIBIOUS SHIPS, APPROXIMATELY 25 FRIGATES/DESTROYERS, 
EIGHT DIESEL SUBMARINES, 10 PATROL BOATS, AND 10 
MINESWEEPERS.  CONSTRUCTION HAS BEGUN ON A LARGE AMPHIBIOUS 
SHIP,8 WHICH WILL BE CAPABLE OF ACTING AS A TROOP TRANSPORT 
AND ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO OPERATE  HELICOPTERS AND AV-8B 
SEA HARRIERS, AND, EVENTUALLY, V/STOL JSFS.  A TYPE 212 
SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM WILL 
WILL REPLACE OLDER SUBMARINES.  THE ITALIAN NAVY ALSO WANTS 
TO ENHANCE ITS AMPHIBIOUS CAPABILITY TO PROJECT POWER BY 
REFITTING ITS TWO LPDS, PROCURING NEW HELICOPTERS AND 
ENLARGING ITS SAN MARCO NAVAL INFANTRY GROUP.  IN 2002, THE 
ITALIANS CONTINUED CO-PRODUCTION, WITH THE FRENCH, OF THE 
HORIZON FRIGATE, A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO REPLACE SEVERAL OLDER 
FRIGATES.  THE ITALIANS HAVE A BILATERAL AMPHIBIOUS AGREEMENT 
WITH THE SPANISH NAVY, WHICH HAS LED TO THE CREATION OF A 
JOINT ITALIAN-SPANISH AMPHIBIOUS FORCE.  THEY ARE ALSO 
PROPOSING CREATION OF A NATO NAVAL HIGH READINESS FORCE USING 
ITALIAN UNITS AS THE CENTERPIECE. 
 
¶29. (U) AIR FORCE:  THE ITALIAN AIR FORCE PROVIDES 
SIGNIFICANT LOGISTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT TO THE US AND 
NATO FORCES.  HOWEVER, ITS ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE DIRECTLY IN

PAGE 03        ROME  00353  06 OF 12  291712Z 
A FORCE-PROJECTION ROLE IS  MODEST.  THE PRIMARY MILITARY 
LIMITATIONS TO OUT OF AREA OPERATIONS OF THE ITALIAN AIR 
FORCE ARE: PROHIBITION OF THE USE OF CONSCRIPTS OVERSEAS, 
LACK OF STRATEGIC LIFT, AND LACK OF ADEQUATE AIR REFUELING 
SUPPORT FOR MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF AIRCRAFT.  ADDITIONALLY, 
IN THE SURFACE ATTACK ROLE, THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT 
INVENTORIES OF PRECISION GUIDED WEAPONS TO SUSTAIN A BOMBING 
CAMPAIGN OF MORE THAN A FEW DAYS.  HOWEVER, SINCE THE END OF 
THE GULF WAR, ITALY HAS MADE DRAMATIC GAINS IN IMPROVING ITS 
CONVENTIONAL WAR FIGHTING ABILITY.  ITALY HAS INCREASED ITS 
PURCHASE OF PRECISION WEAPONS, SIGNED CONTRACTS TO PURCHASE 
US-MADE AIR REFUELING AIRCRAFT, LEASED EX-US F-16 FALCONS (34 
F-16A/B AIRCRAFT TO ARRIVE IN CY2003 FOR USE IN AUGMENTING 
ITS FIGHTER INTERCEPTOR FORCE UNTIL THE EUROFIGHTER TYPHOON 
COMES ON LINE,) PURCHASED 24 C-130J AIRCRAFT, MODIFIED SOME 
TORNADO AIRCRAFT FOR SUPPRESSION OF ENEMY AIR DEFENSE ROLES 
AND INCREASED TRAINING OF TORNADO FLIGHT CREWS IN THE 
EMPLOYMENT OF LASER GUIDED MUNITIONS. 
 
¶30. (U) THE EUROFIGHTER TYPHOON IS THE LARGEST PROCUREMENT 
ITEM IN ITALY,S DEFENSE BUDGET.  ALTHOUGH IT ENTERS SERVICE 
IN 2004, IT WILL NOT REACH FULL OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY UNTIL 
2007 OR 2008.  UNTIL IT REACHES FULL OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY, 
IT WILL NOT GREATLY INCREASE ITALY'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE AIR 
SUPREMACY AND DEPLOYABILITY.  AS A RESULT, A LARGE PART OF 
ITALY,S AIR COMBAT POWER WILL RELY ON OBSOLETE F-104 
STARFIGHTER AIRCRAFT (TO BE REPLACED BY THE EUROFIGHTER 
TYPHOON) AND THE SURFACE ATTACK 
AIRCRAFT, THE JOINT BRAZILIAN-ITALIAN AMX.  ITALY WAS THE 
SECOND FOREIGN CUSTOMER TO SIGN A CONTRACT TO HELP FUND, 
DEVELOP AND MANUFACTURE THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER (JSF), AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  00353  06 OF 12  291712Z 
THE SIZE OF ITS PARTICIPATION MAKES IT THE SECOND LARGEST JSF 
PARTNER(AFTER THE UK).  ITALY PLANS ON TAKING DELIVERY OF ITS 
FIRST JSF IN 2012 AND WILL USE THE AIRCRAFT TO REPLACE ITS 
AMX AND TORNADO AIRCRAFT IN THE SURFACE ATTACK ROLE AND 
REPLACE ITS AV-8B,S ONBOARD THE CARRIER GARIBALDI AND ITS 
SUCCESSOR.  WITH ITALY,S REPLACEMENT OF THE F-104 BY THE 
TYPHOON AND THE REPLACEMENT OF THE AMX WITH THE JOINT STRIKE 
FIGHTER, ITS EMPLOYABLE COMBAT POWER WILL SIGNIFICANTLY 
INCREASE. 
 
¶31. (U) CARABINIERI:  THE CARABINIERI ARE, TECHNICALLY, THE 
FOURTH ELEMENT OF THE ITALIAN ARMED FORCES, AND REPORT TO THE 
MINISTER OF DEFENSE.  WHILE MOST CARABINIERI RESPONSIBILITIES 
ARE FOR DOMESTIC SECURITY AND POLICE, CARABINIERI FORCES PLAY 
A LEADING ROLE IN MSU OPERATIONS IN THE BALKANS, AFGHANISTAN, 
AND ARE IN MANY RESPECTS THE MODEL FOR INTERNATIONAL FORCES 
BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN MILITARY PEACEKEEPING AND CIVILIAN 
POLICING FUNCTIONS.  ADDITIONALLY, PURSUANT TO A 
LONG-STANDING AGREEMENT WITH THE US ARMY, ITALY PROVIDES TWO 
CARABINIERI COMPANIES ON A FULL-TIME BASIS TO THE US ARMY'S 
SOUTHERN EUROPEAN TASK FORCE TO ASSIST IN FORCE PROTECTION

ITALY'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMMON DEFENSE 
------------------------------------------ 
HOST NATION SUPPORT: 
 
¶32. (U) -- ITALY PROVIDES FOR USG USE OF SEVEN PRINCIPAL 
MILITARY BASES AND NUMEROUS SMALLER LOCATIONS, ALL ON A 
NO-FEE BASIS, A UNIQUELY ADVANTAGEOUS ARRANGEMENT FOR THE US 
DEFENSE BUDGET.   THESE STRATEGICALLY LOCATED INSTALLATIONS 
PERMIT A FORMIDABLE US FORCE CAPABILITY VIA THREE AIRBASES, 
ONE STAGING BASE, ONE LARGE AMMUNITION AND EQUIPMENT BASE AND 
TWO HOMEPORTS - ONE WITH THE ONLY ATLANTIC REGION 
MAINTENANCE/REPAIR TENDER SHIP PRIMARILY FOR NUCLEAR POWERED 
SUBMARINES.  US FLEET AND SUBMARINE OPERATIONS IN THE 
MEDITERRANEAN WOULD BE SERIOUSLY HAMPERED WITHOUT THIS 
CAPABILITY. 
-- ITALIAN CIVIL AND MILITARY SECURITY FORCES PROVIDE 
INVALUABLE ANTI-TERRORIST PROTECTION TO US SHIPS TRANSITING 
ITALIAN PORTS AND MILITARY BASES UTILIZED BY USG ALONG WITH 
ARMED CARABINIERI SECURITY OF SENIOR US OFFICERS STATIONED OR 
TRANSITING ITALY AND OTHER DIGNITARIES, AS NECESSARY. 
-- A ROBUST TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCES US 
MILITARY DATA AND VOICE TRANSMISSION WHILE REDUCING 
REQUIREMENTS FOR US MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL THROUGH 
A SUSTAINED AVAILABILITY OF LEASED TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
CIRCUITS. 
-- HOST NATION ASSURANCES FOR SAFE LINES OF COMMUNICATIONS 
(AIRPORTS, SEA PORTS, RAILWAYS, HIGHWAYS, AIR ROUTES) 
FACILITATE THE SURGE OF US MILITARY PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT

PAGE 03        ROME  00353  07 OF 12  291713Z 
DURING TIMES OF CRISIS OR CONFLICT THROUGH THREE SHARED 
CIVILIAN/MILITARY AIRFIELDS WITH BASING OF US AIRCRAFT. 
-- UNPARALLELED AUTHORIZATION OF A US/NATO MUNITIONS STORAGE 
FACILITIES ON ITALIAN SOIL PERMITS INVALUABLE SOURCE FOR A 
PRE-POSITIONED STAGING MUNITIONS CAPABILITY TO EXERCISES AND 
CONTINGENCIES INCLUDING THE WAR ON TERRORISM. 
-- CONVENIENT ACCESS TO MILITARY TRAINING AND EXERCISE RANGES 
ALLOWS THE US MILITARY TO CONDUCT INDISPENSABLE LAND MANEUVER 
EXERCISES, LIVE-FIRE TRAINING, PARACHUTING, AND AIR TRAINING 
ACTIVITIES. 
-- NO-COST LOAN OF 16 ITALIAN ARMY "CENTAURO" WHEELED ARMORED 
VEHICLES TO THE US ARMY SIGNIFICANTLY AIDED THE 
TRANSFORMATION OF NEW INTERIM BRIGADE COMBAT TEAMS TO DEVELOP 
OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS, TACTICS AND PROCEDURES FOR A MOBILE GUN 
SYSTEM. 
-- ITALY HAS BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO SECURITY CONCERNS AS 
EXEMPLIFIED WITH A 10-20 PERCENT INCREASE OF ARMED FORCES TO 
SUPPLEMENT US AND CONTRACT GUARD PERSONNEL RESPONSIBLE FOR 
PERIMETER SECURITY OF US/NATO-UTILIZED INSTALLATIONS. 
-- PROVIDED ADDITIONAL VALUABLE LAND IN SUPPORT OF THE F-16 
BEDDOWN AT AVIANO AIR BASE. 
DEFENSE SPENDING: 
 
¶33. (U) -- ITALIAN CONTRIBUTION TO BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL 
COOPERATIVE PROGRAMS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW WEAPON 
SYSTEMS HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF OUTSTANDING.  THEIR 
PARTICIPATION REDUCES UNIT COSTS WHILE BOLSTERING A VITAL US 
DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASE AS EXEMPLIFIED THROUGH THE JOINT 
STRIKE FIGHTER PROGRAM (JSF), MEDIUM EXTENDED AIR DEFENSE 
SYSTEM, MINI-INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, F-16 FIGHTER 
AIRCRAFT LEASE, LIGHTWEIGHT 155MM HOWITZER DEVELOPMENT, AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

SEVERAL MISSILE UPGRADE PROGRAMS. 
-- DIRECT PROCUREMENT OF US MANUFACTURED MAJOR DEFENSE 
EQUIPMENT PROMOTES AMERICAN PRODUCTS AND INTEROPERABILITY 
WHILE LENGTHENING AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTION LINES AND 
PRESERVING A US INDUSTRIAL BASE AS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH THE 
PURCHASE OF 200 LOCKHEED-MARTIN JSF AIRCRAFT, FIVE GENERAL 
ATOMICS PREDATOR UNMANNED ARIEL VEHICLES, AND LARGE-SCALE 
PURCHASES OF FIVE TYPES OF RAYTHEON MISSILES. 
-- ITALY AGGRESSIVELY PROCURES US-BASED TRAINING VALUED AT 
OVER 60 MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR IN ORDER TO TRAIN ITS 
MILITARY PERSONNEL.  THIS IMMENSE EXPENDITURE SUBSIDIZES 
OPERATING COSTS AND HELPS SUSTAIN US MILITARY ACADEMIC 
INSTITUTIONS. 
 
ROLES AND MISSIONS: 
 
¶34. (U) -- INVALUABLE PRODUCT SHARING OF ITALIAN MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE WITH US COUNTERPARTS CONSTITUTES A NOTEWORTHY 
PORTION OF THE INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS WORKLOAD 
ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAINING FULL COVERAGE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN 
REGION.
