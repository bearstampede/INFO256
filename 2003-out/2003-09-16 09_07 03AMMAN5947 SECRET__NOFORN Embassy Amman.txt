¶1.  (S/NF)  Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) Deputy Governor 
Mohamed Said Shahin phoned ECON/C September 15 with the 
following bank account information for companies suspected of 
being linked to Uday Hussein (refs b and c).  Shahin said he 
was acting on the instructions of CBJ Governor Toukan at the 
request of Prime Minister Abul Ragheb. 
 
¶2.  (S/NF)  The following information resulted from the CBJ's 
search of Jordan National Bank records for the period January 
1, 2000 to December 31, 2001. 
 
Al-Huda Company for General Trade:  Shahin said only trivial 
amounts were found in accounts maintained by this company. 
 
Al-Handal Company:  No accounts in the name of this company 
were located. 
 
Elba House:  Shahin noted that this is a Jordanian company 
that did legitimate business in Jordan.  He said that the 
amounts in the companies accounts during the period were 
consistent with the requirements of normal business 
transactions.  No suspicious activity was evident. 
 
Nabil Karam Company:  No accounts in the name of this company 
were located. 
 
Alwasel and Babel Trading Company:   No accounts in the name 
of this company were located. 
 
Al Eman Commercial Investment Establishment and its 
subsidiaries:  Trivial or zero balances were held in accounts 
in the name of this company. 
 
¶3.  (S/NF)  Embassy Comment:  The CBJ no doubt acted quickly 
to provide this information before September 16 discussions 
between the Prime Minister and Treasury and State officials 
in Washington.  The scope of the  information provided seems 
only partially responsive to the request for broad company 
information made by Treasury investigators.  As is the case 
for requests for access to Jordanian individuals and 
government officials, such information would have to come 
from other Jordanian government authorities -- who would only 
be in a position to provide it at the instruction of the 
Prime Minister.  End Comment.
