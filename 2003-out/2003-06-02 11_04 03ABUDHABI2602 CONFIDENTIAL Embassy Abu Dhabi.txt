SUBJECT:  UAEG DISAPPOINTED WITH OIC MINISTERIAL 
STATEMENT AND WORRIED ABOUT KHATAMI'S 
MARGINALIZATION 
 
REF: FBIS GMP20030601000011 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) During the course of a 5/31 meeting with the 
Ambassador (other topics covered septel), MFA 
Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid noted UAE disappointment 
with the statement produced at last week's OIC 
meeting in Tehran.  Prior to receiving the 
Ambassador, Hamdan had just met with Moroccan 
Foreign Minister Ben Eissa and both agreed that the 
OIC declaration was "one hundred percent" Iranian 
and written prior to the event.  Reportedly, the 
Iranians refused to make any changes to the 
document.  Ben Eissa and Hamdan were both worried 
by the course of events inside Iran and Ben Eissa 
noted that Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi was 
noticeably stressed and unusually nervous during 
the summit.  (Note:  Hamdan's privately expressed 
disappointment is in contrast to ref official 
statement released by the UAEG at the OIC 
ministerial describing the outcome of the 
conference as "good."  End Note.) 
 
¶3. (C) Hamdan went on to reiterate UAE concerns 
about the internal struggle in Iran between the 
hardliners and the moderates.  In his view, Khatami 
has been completely marginalized and Rafsanjani and 
Khamenei are increasingly taking over the reins of 
power. 
 
¶4. (C) Comment:  The Emiratis had placed great hope 
in Khatami as an interlocutor and partner, both in 
terms of improving UAE-Iranian ties and enhancing 
regional security.  Khatami and confidant VP 
Muhammad Abtahi had worked closely with Hamdan and 
the UAE leadership to forge a possible settlement 
for the three decade-long dispute between the two 
countries over the Gulf islands of Abu Musa and the 
Greater and Lesser Tunbs.  With Khatami on the 
outs, the Emiratis fear that any opportunity to 
settle this longstanding bilateral irritant will be 
lost.  More importantly, they with extreme concern 
the destabilizing effect on the region of the 
hardliners' approach. End Comment.
