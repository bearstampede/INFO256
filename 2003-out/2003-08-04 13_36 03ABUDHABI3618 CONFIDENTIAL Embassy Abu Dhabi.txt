SUBJECT:  ORAL MESSAGE FROM SECRETARY POWELL TO 
ARAB LEAGUE FOREIGN MINISTERS 
 
REF:  State 224109 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, 
Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) The Ambassador used the opportunity of an August 4 
telcon with de facto Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamdan Bin 
Zayid Al-Nahyan, who is out of the country, to deliver a 
brief summary of the Secretary's oral message related to 
Iraq and the Roadmap to Arab League Foreign Ministers (see 
reftel). 
 
¶3. (C) Sh. Hamdan said the UAEG is doing everything 
possible to support the situation in Iraq, as well as to 
support the Iraqi Governing Council (GC) and the Coalition. 
He told the Ambassador that the international community 
should realize that there is no alternative to the current 
process in Iraq, but that there is a real need to work 
together to ensure a successful transition of power in 
Iraq.  The Ambassador urged the UAEG to back the current 
process, saying it would be helpful for public opinion if 
there were a public expression of UAEG support for the GC. 
Sh. Hamdan concurred, but added that such a public 
statement from the UAEG in support of the process would 
also convey the importance of moving as rapidly as possible 
to form a permanent form of government.  He asked the 
Ambassador if the US would have any problem with that 
approach.  The Ambassador told Sh. Hamdan that reference to 
a careful transition to a permanent government in Iraq, 
coupled with a public recognition of the GC's interim role, 
would be a balanced statement.  Sh. Hamdan requested that 
the Embassy send the Secretary's talking points to the MFA 
to allow his government to consult about issuing a public 
statement.  The points were delivered before COB Monday.
