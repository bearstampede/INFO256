Classified By: Ambassador E. Gnehm for reason 1.5 d 
 
¶1. (U) Ambasador, economic counselor and PolOff made an 
October 28 courtesy call on newly sworn-in Labor Minister 
Amjad al-Majali (biographic info septel). A former diplomat 
and long-term contact of the embassy, Minister Majali has 
been in office for four days and is new to his portfolio, but 
looks forward to continued cooperation with the U.S., 
particularly on poverty alleviation. 
 
¶2. (U) The Ambassador raised the importance of the Qualified 
Industrial Zones to job creation and the Ministry's key role 
in enforcing labor standards. He also expressed appreciation 
for Ministry efforts in cooperation with the ILO to combat 
child labor. Participants also briefly discussed the 
Ministry's steps to protect foreign domestic workers in 
Jordan. 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT: Majali, a political insider from the powerful 
Majali family of Kerak, displayed little knowlege of his 
portfolio. However, he appears willing to address USG 
concerns on labor standards, child labor, and trafficking in 
persons (although he needs to get up to speed first).
