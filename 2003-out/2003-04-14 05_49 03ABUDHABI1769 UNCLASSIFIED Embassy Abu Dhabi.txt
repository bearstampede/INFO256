SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: UAEG OFFERS MEDICAL TREATMENT TO 
INJURED IRAQIS 
 
REF: ABU DHABI 1662 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  The Office of the Chairman of the General Health 
Authority for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi Hamed bin Zayid 
Al-Nahyan publicly announced on April 13 that the UAE 
Red Crescent Authority (RCA) has been authorized to 
transport wounded Iraqi civilians to the UAE for 
medical treatment.  The spokesman said that the UAEG 
recognizes that Iraqi hospitals are simply overwhelmed 
by the number of patients, and the types of trauma 
encountered, since the onset of hostilities in Iraq. 
 
¶2.  According to press reports, each state-run hospital 
in Abu Dhabi Emirate reserves part of its facilities to 
treat foreign patients in extraordinary circumstances. 
The medical care would be provided free of charge, and 
the RCA would arrange for the transport of the wounded 
from Iraq.  Comment: The announcement is not unusual 
for the UAEG, which also offered free medical treatment 
to wounded Palestinians following the devastation of 
the Jenin refugee camp last year.  We will seek to 
coordinate this effort with the RCA through the 
Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) in Kuwait, and 
provide further details when we receive them.  End 
comment.
