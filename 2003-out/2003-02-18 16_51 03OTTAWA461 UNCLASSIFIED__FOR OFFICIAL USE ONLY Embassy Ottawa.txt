SUBJECT: CANADA ON REINFORCING THE NPT IN THE WAKE OF 
DPRK'S WITHDRAWAL ANNOUNCEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 42535 
 
(SBU) Canada shares our strong concerns (reftel) over North 
Korea's announced intention to withdraw from the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).  Foreign Minister Graham 
issued a press release on January 10 (available at 
www.dfait.gc.ca) deploring this announcement, underscoring 
the importance of the NPT, and urging the DPRK to reverse its 
decision.  Ron Stansfield of Foreign Affairs' Nuclear and 
Chemical Disarmament Agency told us that the GoC also has 
tried to contact the DPRK privately to encourage them not to 
follow through, but has gotten no response.  Stansfield said 
the GoC expected that after UN Security Council 
consideration, action would move back to the IAEA, and 
wondered what steps could be taken then.  He said the GoC 
will continue to work in multilateral fora to encourage the 
DPRK to step back before its NPT withdrawal becomes 
"official" on April 9.
