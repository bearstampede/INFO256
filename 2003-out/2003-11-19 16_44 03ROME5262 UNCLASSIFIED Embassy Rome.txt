SUBJECT: ITALY'S GDP GREW 0.5 PERCENT THIRD QUARTER 2003 
 
 
¶1. ON NOVEMBER 14, ISTAT, ITALY'S CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF 
STATISTICS, RELEASED PRELIMINARY DATA ON GDP GROWTH IN 
THE THIRD QUARTER 2003.  GDP GREW BY 0.5 PERCENT BOTH 
FROM THE PREVIOUS QUARTER AND COMPARED WITH THE 
CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2002.  THIS GROWTH FOLLOWS TWO 
DECREASES IN A ROW IN THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF THE YEAR 
AND IS THE BEST RESULT REGISTERED BY ITALIAN GDP SINCE 
THE FIRST QUARTER 2001. 
 
¶2. FINANCE MINISTER TREMONTI TRUMPETED THE RETURNS BY 
DECLARING, "THE WORST IS OVER NOW," ADDING LATER THAT NOT 
JUST THE DATA WAS IMPORTANT, BUT THAT IT INDICATED AN 
UPWARD TREND. OTHERS WERE LESS CERTAIN.  DEPUTY FINANCE 
MINISTER BALDASSARRI COMMENTED THAT 0.5 PERCENT (THIRD 
QUARTER 2003 GROWTH AND ALSO THE GOI OFFICIAL GDP GROWTH 
TARGET FOR 2003) STILL REPRESENTS MODEST GDP GROWTH IN AN 
ECONOMY THAT HAS A POTENTIAL YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH 
RANGING FROM 2.5 TO 3 PERCENT. OTHER ANALYSTS, SUCH AS 
THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT OF CONFINDUSTRIA, THE LEADING 
INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION, POINTED OUT THAT "THE RECOVERY 
APPEARS FRAGILE AND RELATIVELY MODEST."  THE RESEARCH 
DEPARTMENT OF UNICREDIT, ONE OF ITALY'S TOP FIVE BANKS, 
ALSO DECLARED THAT, "THE DATA REFLECTS GOOD INDUSTRIAL 
PERFORMANCE, BUT IT IS TOO EARLY TO TALK OF ECONOMIC 
RECOVERY, CONSIDERING THE NOT POSITIVE PERFORMANCE OF 
    FOREIGN TRADE." 
 
¶3. (NOTE: ACCORDING TO ISTAT, EXPORTS DECREASED BY 3.0 
PERCENT, WHILE IMPORTS INCREASED BY 0.8 PERCENT IN THE 
FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2003, COMPARED WITH THE 
CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2002.  ITALY'S FOREIGN TRADE 
THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2003 REGISTERED AN E600 MILLION 
DEFICIT, COMPARED WITH AN E6.8 BILLION SURPLUS DURING THE 
SAME TIME PERIOD IN 2002.  END NOTE). 
 
¶4.  IN ADDITION, OTHER ANALYSTS POINT OUT THAT THE THIRD 
QUARTER OF 2003 HAD FOUR WORKING DAYS MORE THAT THE 
PREVIOUS QUARTER AND THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2002. 
GIUSEPPE TURANI, AN ECONOMIC COMMENTATOR OF THE 
INFLUENTIAL LEFTIST DAILY "LA REPUBBLICA" COMMENTED THAT 
THIS LONGER REPORTING PERIOD MAKES THE ITALIAN DATA NOT 
FULLY COMPARABLE WITH THAT OF OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. 
TURANI ALSO DECLARED THAT THE DATA JUST PROVES THAT "WE 
ARE ALIVE, BUT NOTHING ELSE." 
 
¶5. STILL OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT WHILE THIS 
PRELIMINARY GDP GROWTH DATA DOES SHOW THAT INDUSTRY AND 
SERVICES WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GROWTH, THE DATA DOES 
NOT INDICATE WHETHER GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY CONSUMPTION OR 
EXPORTS OR MORE BY A SIMPLE INCREASE OF INVENTORIES (IN 
WHICH CASE THE GROWTH MAY NOT BE SUSTAINED). 
 
¶6. AS FOR COMPARISONS WITH OTHER EU MEMBER ECONOMIES, THE 
ISTAT DATA SHOWS THAT ITALY GREW MORE THAN FRANCE AND 
GERMANY. 
 
    ¶7.  COMMENT. IT IS STILL DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHETHER 
THIRD QUARTER DATA TRULY REPRESENTS THE FIRST SIGNS OF 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY.  TWO IMPORTANT ITALIAN RESEARCH 
INSTITUTES HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER 
DOWNTURN IN INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY MIGHT NEGATIVELY AFFECT 
OVERALL GDP GROWTH IN THE LAST QUARTER OF THE YEAR.  THAT 
SAID, A MODEST 0.25 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE LAST QUARTER 
2003 WOULD STILL ASSURE A 0.5 PERCENT GROWTH FOR THE 
YEAR.  END COMMENT.
