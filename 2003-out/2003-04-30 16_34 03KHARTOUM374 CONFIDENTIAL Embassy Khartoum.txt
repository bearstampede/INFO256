SUBJECT:    RETURN OF SUDANESE BA'ATHISTS 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 317 
 
CLASSIFIED BY LAUREL STEELE, POLITICAL OFFICER, REASONS 1.5 B, D 
 
¶1.  (C) OVER 80 MEMBERS OF THE SUDANESE BA'ATH PARTY HAVE 
RETURNED FROM IRAQ TO SUDAN IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS.  THE MOST 
PROMINENT SUDANESE BA'ATHIST AND FOUNDER OF THE PARTY IN SUDAN, 
BADR-ADDIN MUDATHIR, RETURNED, POST WAS TOLD, ON PRESIDENT OMAR 
AL-BASHIR'S PLANE FROM SYRIA, LANDING AT KHARTOUM'S MILITARY 
AIRPORT TEN DAYS AGO.  HIS RETURN WAS REPORTED IN THE PRESS, 
ALTHOUGH NO DETAILS WERE GIVEN. 
 
¶2.  (C) ANOTHER RETURNING SUDANESE REPORTED TO POST THAT SOME 
SUDANESE IN IRAQ HAD BEEN SHOT BY ANTI-SADDAM IRAQIS IN THE 
AFTERMATH OF THE US. INVASION.  OTHERS HAD FLED TO REFUGEE CAMPS 
ON THE IRAQ/SYRIA BORDER.  PRESIDENT BASHIR HAD VISITED SYRIA TO 
HELP FACILITATE THEIR DEPARTURE. 
 
¶3.  (C) THE GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTEDLY ALLOWED THE RETURN OF THE 
SUDANESE BA'ATHISTS ON THE CONDITION THAT THEY NOT TAKE PART IN 
ANY POLITICAL ACTIVITY HERE.  THE GOS IS LEERY OF PUBLIC 
EXPRESSION OF ANTI-US OR ANTI-BRITISH FEELINGS.  IN THE BUILDUP 
TO THE IRAQ WAR, BA'ATHISTS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANTI-GOVERNMENT 
GRAFFITI.  NINE LOCAL BA'ATHISTS WERE ARRESTED AND ARE STILL IN 
JAIL.  MUDATHIR HIMSELF IS IN HIS SEVENTIES AND ILL, AND 
PRESUMABLY PRESENTS LITTLE PROBLEM TO THE GOS. 
 
¶4.  (U) BACKGROUND:  THE BA'ATH PARTY IN SUDAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
SMALL, WITH PROBABLY NO MORE THAN 1,000 MEMBERS.  BUT BECAUSE 
IRAQ BACKED IT FINANCIALLY, THERE WAS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF 
THE SUDANESE BA'ATH PARTY HAVING AN IMPACT THAT BELIED ITS 
MEAGER NUMBERS.  THE PARTY RECRUITED HEAVILY AMONG STUDENTS 
(OFFERING SCHOLARSHIPS TO IRAQ) AND IN PERIPHERAL AREAS, LIKE 
NUBA, AND AMONG THE AFRICAN TRIBES.  IN 1990, 26 BA'ATHIST 
MILITARY OFFICERS WERE EXECUTED IN KHARTOUM AFTER AN 
UNSUCCESSFUL COUP ATTEMPT.
