SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION ON IMF, AUGUST 4, 2003 
 
 
Â¶1. Op-ed by Roberto C. Ordoez in Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily 
"La Tribuna" on 8/4 entitled "What does the Fund want?". "The 
last Letter of Intent of the Honduran government with the IMF was 
signed by the Carlos Flores administration. In September 2001, 
the IMF unilaterally broke the agreement when they proved that 
none of the promises we made to tighten our belt had been 
fulfilled. The current administration has been unable to sign any 
Letter because, according to key public officials, the figures 
the IMF used to reach the last agreement were inaccurate, which 
is yet to be proved." 
 
"The omnipotent IMF is the key to opening the gates of 
international funding.  Without their blessing, there's no debt 
relief or new loans. What it wants is to reinvent the 
governments. It's the only way to please it, because our current 
governmental model is about to collapse, but with a bureaucracy 
that still wants a large piece of the budget."
