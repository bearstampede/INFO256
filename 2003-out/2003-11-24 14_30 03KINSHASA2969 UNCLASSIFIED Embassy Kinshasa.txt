A) THE GDRC HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF U.S. REPRESENTATIONS ON 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM ISSUES THROUGHOUT 2003, BUT THE 
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN KINSHASA IS WEAK AND CONTROLS ONLY A 
PORTION OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.

TERRORISM-RELATED CASES ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN TRIED IN 2003.

IMPEDIMENTS TO DOMESTIC PROSECUTION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.

SEPTEMBER 2003 SPEECH HE DELIVERED AT THE UNGA.  HE AND TOP

DEATH OF U.N. OFFICIAL DE MELLO IN IRAQ IN AUGUST 2003. 
 
F) THE GDRC UNDERTOOK NO MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS IN

ELEMENTS WITHIN THE GDRC CONTINUED TO PROVIDE SOME ARMS AND
