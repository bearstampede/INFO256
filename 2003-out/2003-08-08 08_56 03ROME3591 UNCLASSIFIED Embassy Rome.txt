SUBJECT:  UN FLASH APPEAL FOR THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. AS PER RECENT UNITED NATIONS (UN) STATEMENTS, THE 
SITUATION IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC HAS STABILIZED 
SUFFICIENTLY TO ENABLE THE DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE.  THE U.S. DOLLARS (USD) 9.1 MILLION UN FLASH 
APPEAL, AVAILABLE ON RELIEFWEB (THE WEB SITE OF THE UN'S 
OFFICE FOR THE COORDINATION OF HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS), 
INCLUDES BOTH AN AGRICULTURAL LIVELIHOODS COMPONENT AND A 
REQUEST FOR FOOD AID.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------- 
BACKGROUND 
------- 
 
¶2. SINCE MARCH 2003, THE POLITICAL AND MILITARY PANORAMA IN 
THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC (CAR) HAS CHANGED WITH THE 
OVERTHROW OF THE FORMER REGIME.  AS PER THE UN, MEASURES 
TAKEN BY THE NEW POLITICAL AUTHORITIES HAVE NOW CREATED 
ACCEPTABLE CONDITIONS TO PERMIT DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE. 
 
¶3. MEANWHILE A SERIOUS HUMANITARIAN SITUATION HAS ARISEN. 
BECAUSE OF FREQUENT LOOTING, THE POPULATION IS DEPRIVED OF 
BASIC COMMODITIES AND BASIC SERVICES INCLUDING HEALTH 
INSTITUTIONS, PHARMACEUTICAL OUTLETS, SCHOOLS, AND SHOPS. 
 
¶4. CONTINUED FIGHTING BY REBEL AND LOYALIST FORCES IN 
    OUTLYING AREAS EXPOSE VILLAGERS TO PHYSICAL INSECURITY AND 
THE RISK OF DISEASE, MALNUTRITION, AND EPIDEMICS. 
 
¶5. THE AIM OF THE FLASH APPEAL IS TO OBTAIN RESOURCES TO 
ENSURE THE SURVIVAL OF 2.2 MILLION PEOPLE, INCLUDING 400,000 
CHILDREN.  THE APPEAL ALSO SEEKS TO PROVIDE UN SUPPORT FOR 
BASIC SERVICES.  THE UN'S FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION 
(FAO) WOULD PROVIDE SEEDS AND OTHER VITAL AGRICULTURAL 
INPUTS TO FARMERS.  APART FROM FOOD SECURITY-RELATED 
ACTIVITIES SPANNING 12 MONTHS, MOST OF THE OTHER ACTIVITIES 
IN THE APPEAL COVER A PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS. 
 
¶6. FINANCIAL NEEDS ARE ESTIMATED AT ABOUT U.S. DOLLARS (USD) 
9.1 MILLION, INCLUDING USD 3 MILLION FOR HEALTH CARE, USD 
4.8 MILLION FOR FOOD SECURITY (ABOUT USD 2.6 MILLION FOR FAO 
AND USD 2.2 MILLION FOR THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME), USD 220 
THOUSAND FOR HUMAN PROTECTION, AND USD 970 THOUSAND FOR 
COORDINATION REINFORCEMENT AND FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT. 
 
¶7. IN NOVEMBER 2003 THE UN WILL PREPARE AN INTER-AGENCY 
CONSOLIDATED APPEAL THAT PROVIDES FORECASTED REQUIREMENTS 
FOR 2004.  HALL
