SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI: 9/11 CEREMONY 
 
Â¶1. (U)  Post held a simple commemorative ceremony in the 
residence garden on the morning of September 11.  The event 
was widely attended by the diplomatic corps and the resident 
military leadership.  The Charge d'Affaires delivered 
portions of President Bush's Patriot Day message.  The 
Djiboutian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdi Farah, delivered 
a speach offering condolences to the U.S. people and 
reflecting favorably on the U.S. response to 9/11 and the 
increased U.S.-Djiboutian cooperation.  The resident catholic 
bishop and one of Post's local guards respected for his 
Koranic knowledge offered prayers to close the ceremony. 
Media did not cover the commemorative event but the state 
bi-weekly did run two positive pieces on the anniversary of 
9/11.
