SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
¶1. DESPITE THE MAOIST PLEDGE TO HALT ALL OFFENSIVE ACTIONS 
DURING OCTOBER 2 - 10 FOR THE DASAIN HOLIDAY, THE 
INSURGENTS CONTINUED TO TARGET NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
PROJECTS AND ATTACK SECURITY FORCES (REFTEL).  ACCORDING 
TO LOCAL PRESS ACCOUNTS, 19 MAOISTS, 2 POLICEMEN AND 2 
ROYAL NEPAL ARMY (RNA) SOLDIERS DIED IN CLASHES DURING 
THIS PERIOD.  INNOCENT CIVILIANS SUFFERED; SOME WERE 
KILLED IN THE CROSSFIRE WHILE SCHOOLS AND ACCESS TO 
GOVERNMENT SERVICES WERE DISRUPTED.  MAOISTS THIS WEEK 
LOOTED SEVERAL TONS OF GRAIN AND FOOD.  THE INSURGENTS 
ALSO CONTINUED THEIR RHETORIC AGAINST AMERICAN TOURISTS 
AND, ON OCTOBER 9, ATTACKED A PEPSI-COLA VAN.  ALTHOUGH 
MORE YOUNG MEN ARE SEEKING RECRUITMENT WITH THE GURKHA 
BATTALIONS IN INDIA AND THE U.K., MAOISTS REPORTEDLY ARE 
FORCIBLY PREVENTING APPLICANTS FROM TRAVELING TO 
RECRUITMENT CENTERS.  DESPITE ONGOING HOSTILITIES DURING 
THE SUPPOSED CEASEFIRE, MEMBERS OF CIVIL SOCIETY ARE 
URGING THE MAOISTS TO EXTEND THE CEASEFIRE THROUGH THE 
OCTOBER 25-27 TIHAR FESTIVAL.  END SUMMARY.

CIVIL SOCIETY CALLS FOR MAOISTS TO EXTEND CEASEFIRE 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. ON OCTOBER 9, MEMBERS OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND POLITICAL 
LEADERS URGED THE MAOISTS TO EXTEND THE CEASEFIRE THROUGH 
THE NATIONAL TIHAR HOLIDAY, WHICH TAKES PLACE ON OCTOBER 
25-27.  THEY ALSO PRESSED THE GOVERNMENT TO RECIPROCATE 
WITH A CALL FOR RENEWED DIALOGUE.  PADMA RATNA TULADHAR, A 
FACILITATOR DURING THE PEACE TALKS AND INFORMAL SPOKESMAN 
FOR THE MAOISTS, SAID, "AN EXTENSION OF THE CEASEFIRE UP 
TO TIHAR COULD CREATE A CONDUCIVE ATMOSPHERE FOR THE 
TALKS." 
 
------------------------------------------ 
CIVILIANS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE PAY A PRICE 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. VILLAGERS IN BAGLUNG DISTRICT IN WESTERN NEPAL HAVE 
COMPLAINED THAT VILLAGE DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE (VDC) 
SECRETARIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE EITHER IN THEIR VDC AREAS OR 
 
SIPDIS 
IN THE DISTRICT HEADQUARTERS.  LIKEWISE, THE INTERNATIONAL 
LABOR ORGANIZATION IN NEPAL REPORTS THAT MANY SCHOOLS HAVE 
CLOSED ACROSS THE COUNTRY SINCE TEACHERS ARE NOT WILLING 
TO RESIDE IN REMOTE, MAOIST-AFFECTED AREAS.  THESE SCHOOL 
CLOSURES ARE HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CHILD LABOR 
PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY. 
 
¶4. NEPALI CITIZENS REGULARLY ARE CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE 
OR ARE MISTAKENLY TARGETED BY THE MAOISTS AND SECURITY 
FORCES.  MAOISTS CONTINUE TO TARGET AND MURDER PROMINENT 
VILLAGERS WHO ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH THEIR MOVEMENT.  A 
FEW EXAMPLES OF INCIDENTS THIS WEEK ARE NOTED BELOW: 
 
-- ON OCTOBER 2, RNA SOLDIERS IN THE KATHMANDU VALLEY 
REPORTEDLY SHOT AND INJURED TWO NEPALI MEN AND ARRESTED 
THEIR THREE COMPANIONS AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO RUN AWAY FROM 
THE PATROL.  AN RNA INVESTIGATION LATER CONCLUDED THAT 
THOSE ARRESTED WERE NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE MAOISTS. 
 
-- ON OCTOBER 6, MAOISTS REPORTEDLY KILLED A SECONDARY 
SCHOOL HEADMASTER IN DADELDHURA DISTRICT IN THE FAR WEST 
OF NEPAL AFTER ABDUCTING HIM ON SEPTEMBER 2 FOR 
INTERROGATION. 
 
-- ON OCTOBER 7, SUSPECTED MAOISTS IN RAUTAHAT DISTRICT IN 
CENTRAL NEPAL SHOT AND KILLED A 10-YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS 
WASHING DISHES OUTSIDE HIS FATHER'S TEASHOP.  THE 
INSURGENTS ALLEGEDLY OPENED FIRE ON THE TEASHOP BECAUSE A 
GROUP OF SECURITY PERSONNEL WERE DRINKING TEA INSIDE. 
NONE OF THE SECURITY PERSONNEL WERE INJURED. 
 
-- THAT SAME DAY IN BAGLUNG DISTRICT, SECURITY FORCES SHOT 
AND INJURED A GIRL AFTER SHE STARTED RUNNING AWAY FROM 
THEM IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
MAOISTS STEAL FOOD FROM HOMES AND STORES 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. ON OCTOBER 7, MAOISTS IN UDAYAPUR DISTRICT IN THE 
EASTERN TERAI LOOTED APPROXIMATELY 2.5 TONS OF RICE FROM A 
PRIVATE HOUSE.  ON OCTOBER 8, MAOISTS IN GULMI DISTRICT IN 
WESTERN NEPAL ABDUCTED THE OWNERS AND SEIZED CONTROL OF A 
LARGE GENERAL PROVISION STORE.  THE INSURGENTS 
SUBSEQUENTLY LOOTED NRPS 150,000 (USD 2,000) AND ROUGHLY 
1.5 TONS OF RICE.  LOCALS REPORT THAT THE MAOISTS CONTINUE 
TO STEAL FOODSTUFFS FROM THE STORE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
MAOISTS SINGLE OUT AMERICAN TOURISTS AND PEPSI-COLA VAN 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶6. ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT MAOISTS IN SOME PLACES 
CONTINUE TO SINGLE OUT AMERICANS IN THEIR PUBLIC RHETORIC. 
A DUTCH TOURIST REPORTED SEEING GRAFFITI IN GHOREPANI, ON 
THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE ANNAPURNA CIRCUIT, SAYING IN 
EFFECT THAT TOURISTS ARE WELCOME, BUT AMERICANS SHOULD GO 
HOME.  OTHER TOURISTS ON A BUS HEADING TO KATHMANDU FROM 
TIBET REPORTEDLY WERE STOPPED BY MAOISTS WHO BOARDED THE 
BUS AND ASKED SPECIFICALLY WHETHER ANY AMERICANS WERE ON- 
BOARD (NONE WERE). 
 
¶7. ON OCTOBER 9, MAOISTS SET FIRE TO A VAN OWNED BY A 
DISTRIBUTOR OF PEPSI-COLA IN SINDUPALCHOWK DISTRICT IN 
CENTRAL NEPAL.  THE LOCAL DISTRIBUTOR WAS UNABLE TO 
PROVIDE FURTHER DETAILS AT THIS TIME.  POST WILL SEND MORE 
INFORMATION AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE.  THIS IS THE SECOND 
TIME, FOLLOWING AN ATTACK IN MAY 2002, THAT THE MAOISTS 
HAVE TARGETED TRUCKS CARRYING PEPSI-COLA.  [NOTE.  COCA- 
COLA, WHICH MAINTAINS TWO FACTORIES IN NEPAL, HAS BEEN 
SUBJECT TO THREE ATTACKS SINCE 2001.  END NOTE.] 
 
---------------------------------------- 
MAOIST IMPACT ON GURKHA ARMY RECRUITMENT 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. PRESS REPORTS INDICATE, AND MILITARY LEADERS BELIEVE, 
THAT THE INSURGENCY HAS CAUSED INCREASED NUMBERS OF YOUNG 
NEPALI MEN TO SEEK RECRUITMENT IN THE GURKHA BATTALIONS OF 
THE INDIAN AND BRITISH ARMIES.  HOWEVER, MAOISTS 
REPORTEDLY HAVE FORCIBLY PREVENTED MANY YOUNG MEN FROM 
TRAVELING TO RECRUITMENT CENTERS.  ONE ENGLISH DAILY 
REPORTED ON OCTOBER 10 THAT RECRUITMENT LEVELS FROM 
CERTAIN EASTERN DISTRICTS WERE DOWN 50 PERCENT FROM LAST 
YEAR.

¶9. ON OCTOBER 2, MAOISTS IN NAWALPARASI DISTRICT IN THE 
CENTRAL TERAI (SOUTHERN BELT), EXPLODED PRESSURE COOKER 
BOMBS AT TWO VACANT POLICE POSTS.  LIKEWISE, INSURGENTS IN 
DADELDHURA DISTRICT IN FAR-WESTERN NEPAL DESTROYED A 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS REPEATER STATION THAT HAD RECENTLY BEEN 
RESTORED AFTER A PREVIOUS MAOIST ATTACK.  ON OCTOBER 5, 
INSURGENTS IN TAPLEJUNG DISTRICT IN FAR-EASTERN NEPAL 
DESTROYED A SUSPENSION BRIDGE, ISOLATING TWELVE VILLAGE 
DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE (VDC) AREAS. 
 
¶10. ON OCTOBER 6, MAOISTS EXPLODED A BOMB IN THE 
POWERHOUSE OF A 250-KILOWATT HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT IN 
OKHALDHUNGA DISTRICT IN EASTERN NEPAL, SIGNIFICANTLY 
DAMAGING THE CONTROL PANEL AND DEPRIVING 800 FAMILIES OF 
ELECTRICITY.  THE COST OF THE CONTROL PANEL STANDS AT OVER 
NRS 1.2 MILLION (USD 16,000).  THE NEPAL ELECTRICITY 
AUTHORITY (NEA) REPORTED THAT THIS ATTACK IS THE SECOND 
MOST DESTRUCTIVE ACT EVER BY THE MAOISTS AGAINST THE 
COUNTRY'S ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE.  THAT SAME DAY, 
MAOISTS SET FIRE TO A VDC OFFICE IN MAKWANPUR DISTRICT IN 
CENTRAL NEPAL. 
 
¶11. ON OCTOBER 7, MAOISTS SET FIRE TO A SECONDARY SCHOOL, 
THE ONLY SCHOOL IN THAT PARTICULAR VDC IN UDAYAPUR 
DISTRICT.  ON OCTOBER 8, INSURGENTS IN KANCHANPUR DISTRICT 
IN FAR-WESTERN NEPAL SET FIRE TO A TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
EXCHANGE.

--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶12. ALTHOUGH MAOIST ACTIVITY WAS SOMEWHAT SUBDUED THIS

OCCURRED ACROSS THE COUNTRY: 
 
-- ON OCTOBER 2, ONE SUSPECTED MAOIST WAS KILLED IN A
