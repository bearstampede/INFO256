SUBJECT: (C) KUWAITI FM DISCUSSES IRAN/IAEA 
 
Classified By: AMB. RICHARD H. JONES; REASON 1.5 (B, D) 
 
¶1.  (C) Foreign Minister Shaykh Dr. Mohammed Sabah told the 
Ambassador September 30 that Kuwait has told Iran it must 
sign the NPT Additional Protocol (AP), and he expects the GCC 
states to press this point at the OIC Summit in Kuala Lumpur. 
 He also expects Iran to make a big push for support at that 
Summit.  Dr. Mohammed agreed with the Ambassador that the 
world is united on this issue, it is not just the US that is 
concerned.  He said IAEA DG El-Baradei has no hidden agenda. 
 
¶2.  (C) The FM was not sure whether Iran had managed to 
insert any language into the OIC Summit communique, which was 
being negotiated in New York, but he promised to try to find 
out. 
 
¶3.  (C) Dr. Mohammed wanted to know what exactly the US 
demands that Iran do by the October 31 deadline:   sign the 
AP, or persuade IAEA that it does not have a nuclear weapons 
program?  The Ambassador replied that signing the AP is 
important but not sufficient.  He emphasized that the burden 
of proof is on Iran to, inter alia, prove that it has not 
diverted nuclear material to non-peaceful purposes.  He 
shared with the Minister cleared NEA press guidance for the 
9/29 Noon Briefing.
