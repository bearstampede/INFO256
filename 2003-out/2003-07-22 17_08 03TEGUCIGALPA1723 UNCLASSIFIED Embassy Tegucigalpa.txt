SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION ON IMF, JULY 21, 2003 
 
 
Â¶1. Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La Tribuna" on 
7/21 entitled "IMF". "This is the fifth time this administration 
announces a national dialogue, but it has never taken place. Now 
it has come the time to get prepared to negotiate with the IMF." 
 
"Despite the previous economic measures taken by the government, 
there was no agreement with the IMF. Meanwhile, other serious 
problems came about, such as the escalation of violence, 
organized crime and drug trafficking, and the economy doesn't get 
going and unemployment becomes unbearable. Consequently, it is 
essential to have a national dialogue because it's imperative to 
reach an agreement with the IMF in a short term." 
 
"We hope this time the national dialogue isn't just a 
manifestation of good intentions. By now, the President should 
know that things get much better every time he takes care of them 
by himself."
