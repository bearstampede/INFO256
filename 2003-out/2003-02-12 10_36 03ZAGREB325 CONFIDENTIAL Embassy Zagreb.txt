¶4. (C) THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE GOTOVINA'S DISAPPEARANCE 
18 MONTHS AGO THAT THE CROATIAN INTERIOR MINISTRY HAS PASSED

THE GOC FINDS ITSELF UNDER MOUNTING PRESSURE FROM THE 
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE AT THE HAGUE TRIBUNAL TO DEMONSTRATE THAT 
IT IS TAKING ACTIVE MEASURES TO FIND GOTOVINA. 
 
¶5. (C) WE DEFER TO EMBASSY SARAJEVO AND OTHERS TO ASSESS THE 
QUALITY OF THE GOC INFORMATION AND WOULD WELCOME ANY ANALYSIS
