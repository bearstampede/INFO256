(U) Classified by Ambassador E. Ashley Wills. 
Reasons 1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (S/NF) The Ambassador spoke to Sri Lankan Foreign 
Secretary Nihal Rodrigo on April 11, and reviewed Ref B 
 
SIPDIS 
points re expulsion of post-Saddam official Iraqis and 
suspending the operations of its embassy.  Rodrigo 
replied that the situation was very "confusing" and that 
the GSL was "polling" the views of other South Asian 
countries.  He said that as far as the government was 
aware there were only two Iraqi officials left in the 
country:  Charge Wajdi Mardan Abbas and one other 
person.  (Note:  See Ref C regarding a recent 
communication by Abbas, a known Iraqi intelligence 
operative, to the U.S. Embassy.)  Two other officials 
had recently left the country.  As if he was feeling 
sorry for the Iraqis, Rodrigo commented that Abbas was 
here "with his wife and two children" and the other 
Iraqi official seemed to be a courier. 
 
¶2.  (S/NF) Ambassador also reviewed Ref A points re 
protecting Iraqi diplomatic property with Rodrigo. 
 
¶3.  (S/NF) COMMENT:  Rodrigo said the GSL would review 
the issues that the Ambassador raised and get back to us 
shortly.  The Ambassador was left with the strong 
impression that the government did not plan to expel 
Abbas, however.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶4.  (U) Minimize considered.
