¶1. Aristedes Crespo, Floor Leader for the ruling FRG party in 
Congress, used the visit of three Cuban legislators to 
announce in Congress that the FRG would press President 
Portillo to support Cuba at this year's UNCHR in Geneva. 
Crespo said his remarks were in response to Cuba's 
long-standing solidarity with the people of Guatemala and 
called for the Government of Guatemala not to vote against 
Cuba. 
 
¶2.  Crespo is the right-hand-man of Rios Montt, the FRG's 
leader and President of Congress.  The FRG holds a 
disciplined 63-seat majority among the 113 members of 
Congress.  The Guatemalan Congress passed a motion last year 
that called for Executive branch support for Cuba at the 
UNCHR.
