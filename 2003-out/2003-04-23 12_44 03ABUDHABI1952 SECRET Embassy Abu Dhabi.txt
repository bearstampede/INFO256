SUBJECT: UAE ON BOARD FOR GCC OBSERVER ATTENDANCE 
AT NASRIYAH FOLLOW-UP MEETING IN BAGHDAD APRIL 28 
 
REF:  STATE 102803 
 
¶1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA 
FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶2.  (S)  The Ambassador delivered reftel demarche 
April 23 to MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayed. 
Shaykh Hamdan said he had already heard from the 
Qataris on the issue of GCC representation at the 
April 28 meeting in Baghdad; the UAE was fully on 
board with this idea.  The Minstate said he thought 
that Qatari FM HBJ might attend as the GCC 
representative rather than GCC SecGen Al-Attiyah.
