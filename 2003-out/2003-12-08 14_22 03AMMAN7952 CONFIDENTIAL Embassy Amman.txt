SUBJECT: JORDANIAN REACTION TO POTUS IRAQ VISIT 
 
 
Classified By: CDA David Hale for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
------ 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) A sampling of Jordanian reaction to the POTUS visit to 
Iraq on November 27 indicates that many here believe the 
visit exposes low morale of U.S. forces in Iraq in need of a 
boost and pre-election posturing intended for U.S. 
consumption.  Press reaction was light yet critical, while 
military contacts were solidly behind the President's efforts 
and believe it will have a positive effect on the Iraqi 
people.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
POLITICAL "PRE-ELECTION" POSTURING 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) Jordanians outside of government whom we talked to 
viewed the President's Thanksgiving day visit to Iraq as a 
"public relations" pre-election ploy staged for U.S. voters. 
Many believed that the "stealthy" trip exposed the failure of 
U.S. forces to stabilize security in Iraq and their need for 
a "presidential" morale boost. 
 
---------------------------------- 
PRESS REACTION: LIGHT YET CRITICAL 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) On December 1, center-left daily Al-Dustour wrote that 
President Bush had to visit Iraq in total secrecy due to the 
"crisis and state of chaos" in the country.  The daily also 
criticized the President's  meetings with Americans while 
sidestepping average Iraqis.  It called the "American 
Thanksgiving in Iraq" a deception intended for the American 
people in contrast to the reality of the Iraqi street where 
U.S. soldiers are dying on a daily basis. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
MILITARY CONTACTS: ENCOURAGED BY VISIT 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Contrary to this editorial, contacts within the 
Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF) present an opposite opinion. 
JAF counterparts are solidly behind the efforts by the 
President, are encouraged by his willingness to visit Iraq, 
and believe the visit will have a positive effect on the 
Iraqi people.  Military interlocutors nearly unanimously 
state that it is an illustration of the courage of the 
Administration.  They believe that the visit showed the 
personal desire of the President to reach a solution to the 
conflict, and that his presence may illustrate to the Iraqi 
people that the U.S. is intent to see the political 
transition through to its conclusion.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5. (C) For those Jordanians who noticed the President's trip, 
most put it in the context of troop morale building and U.S. 
domestic politics, not an effort to help the rebuilding of 
Iraq. 
 
¶6. (U) CPA Baghdad minimize considered.
