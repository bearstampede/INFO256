SUBJECT: OSCE MEETING ON ANTI-SEMITISM: TURKISH MFA RESPONSE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 93197 
 
 
Poloff April 11 delivered reftel points to Omer Tuzel, head 
of the MFA OSCE Department.  Tuzel said the GOT in the past 
has been represented by its Permrep at one- or two-day OSCE 
meetings.  He said it would be difficult for the GOT to send 
a larger delegation to the Anti-Semitism Meeting under 
current austerity measures, though he did not rule it out. 
He said he will inform Embassy when the GOT determines who 
will represent it at the meeting.
