SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PROBLEMS CONTINUE WITH MPRI FUNDING 
 
REF: ABUJA 1310 
 
 
¶1.  (U) National Security Adviser Aliyu Mohammed Gusau told 
POLOFF August 11 that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had 
been unable to transfer the USD 1 million to fund the MPRI 
Civ/Mil program through December.  Embassy Abuja verified 
that the CBN had the correct account information on August 1, 
making it seem that the CBN cannot transfer the funds to this 
account.  The NSA said funding MPRI was a priority for him, 
but that every delay in completing the transfer increases the 
chances that the cash strapped GON will use the funds for 
another purpose. 
 
 
¶2.  (U) ACTION REQUESTED: With MPRI preparing to close down 
operations in Abuja, it is imperative that the transfer take 
place as soon as possible.  For whatever reason, the wire 
transfer from the CBN to the U.S. Treasury account is not 
working.  Post requests Washington,s guidance on how to 
proceed.  Post asks whether another account or transfer 
method could be used.  For example, NSA Mohammed stated he 
would be willing to transfer the funds directly to Embassy 
Abuja or perhaps issue a negotiable bank draft to the U.S. 
Government.
