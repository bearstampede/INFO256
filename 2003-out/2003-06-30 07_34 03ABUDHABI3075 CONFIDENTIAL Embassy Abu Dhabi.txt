SUBJECT:  (U) UAE SUPPORT FOR THE POLISH-LED 
MULTINATIONAL DIVISION IN IRAQ 
 
REF:  SECDEF 251715Z 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) The Ambassador raised the issue of UAE 
support for the Polish-led multinational division 
with UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff Muhammad bin 
Zayid Al-Nahyan (MbZ) via letter and a follow-up 
phone call on June 28.  Attached to the letter was 
the list of countries requiring transportation 
assistance detailed reftel.  MbZ's Special 
Assistant, Yousef Al-Otaiba, telephoned Polchief 
June 30 with the UAE's official response.  The UAE 
has agreed to provide transportation assistance to 
the eight European countries listed, i.e. Poland, 
Ukraine, Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia, 
Latvia and Romania.  Al-Otaiba said the UAE was 
prepared to offer two "roll-on, roll-off" ships and 
one hundred hours of an Aleutian 124 aircraft to 
ferry the troops and their equipment to Iraq.  He 
indicated that UAE GHQ Director of Operations 
Brigadier Ali Al-Kaabi would be in touch with the 
Embassy's Acting USLO Chief for specific 
arrangements. 
 
¶3. (C) On the approach to Dubai Crown Prince and 
UAE Defense Minister Muhammad bin Rashid Al-Maktoum 
(MbR) regarding vehicles for Iraq and Afghanistan, 
our Acting CG in Dubai has a meeting scheduled with 
Sayanta Basu of The Investment Office on Tuesday, 
July 1.  We will report on the details of that 
meeting as soon as they are available. 
 
¶4. (C) Comment:  Given the UAE's finite military 
transportation resources, we believe their pledge 
to support the mobilization of the Polish-led 
division based out of Europe is appropriate and, 
indeed, quite generous.  The UAE military would 
have been unable, in our opinion, to support the 
transportation needs of troops from some of the 
more far-flung areas of the globe.
