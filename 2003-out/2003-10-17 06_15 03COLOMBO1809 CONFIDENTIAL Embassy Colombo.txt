¶1.  (C) Ambassador Lunstead reviewed Secretary Powell's 
message on the upcoming Iraq Donors Conference with 
Foreign Minister Tyronne Fernando during their 
October 17 meeting.  Fernando listened intently to the 
Secretary's points and seemed genuinely interested in

the conference.  He noted, however, that the Spanish 
President had sent the original invitation letter for 
the conference directly to President Kumaratunga.  This 
potentially raised cohabitation problems given Sri 
Lanka's divided government.  Fernando said he would 
raise the matter with the President when they met 
immediately after the meeting with the Ambassador.  With 
the conference coming up next week, he promised he would 
get back to us as soon as possible. 
 
¶2.  (U) Minimize considered.
