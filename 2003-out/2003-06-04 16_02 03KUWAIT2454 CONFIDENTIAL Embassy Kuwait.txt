SUBJECT: BORDER FREE-FOR-ALL; GOK COMPLAINS ABOUT LACK OF 
COALITION BORDER CONTROL IN IRAQ 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para. 4. 
 
¶2. (C) During their June 4 meeting, Kuwaiti MinState for 
Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed al-Sabah informed the 
Ambassador that the Kuwaiti business community is becoming 
increasingly frustrated that coalition forces in Iraq are not 
controlling Iraq's borders.  Dr. Mohammed said the lack of 
control on the Iraqi side is forcing the GOK to keep its 
border crossings closed to most commercial activity, severely 
hampering the ability of Kuwaiti companies to conduct 
cross-border commerce.  This did not appear to be the case 
with Jordan and Turkey's borders, he said.  Dr. Mohammed 
asked the Ambassador to share any plans the coalition may 
have to control Iraq's borders with him as soon as possible. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment: Embassy has also received reports that GCC 
businessmen, including Kuwaitis, cannot get their goods into 
Iraq through Kuwait, but Iraqi borders with Turkey and Jordan 
are open and bustling.  While Kuwait continues to maintain 
close control of its borders, the fact that Kuwaiti 
businessmen have resorted to shipping goods to Iraq via 
points as distant as Aqaba is putting the GOK in a very 
difficult spot.  Dr. Mohammed's comments to the Ambassador 
are an obvious indicator that pressure on the GOK from 
Kuwait's business community is steadily mounting.  End 
Comment. 
 
¶4. Action Request:  Post requests Department guidance on how 
to best respond to Dr. Mohammed's inquiry about plans for 
further control of Iraqi borders.
