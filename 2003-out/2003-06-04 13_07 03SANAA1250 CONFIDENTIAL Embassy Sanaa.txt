¶1.  (U)  Pol/E Deputy Chief delivered reftel demarche to 
Ambassador Ahmed al-Wan Mulhi, Chief of the Legal and 
International Conventions Department at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs on June 3.  Dr. Mulhi agreed that instruments 
to protect children were an important international effort. 
He noted that Yemen's ratification of ILO Convention No. 182 
had resulted in the ROYG's strong cooperation with the ILO 
and IPEC on specific programs to combat child labor despite 
the widespread poverty in Yemen that causes it. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Mulhi asked for the protocols on children in armed 
conflict and sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography in Arabic to facilitate efforts in the ROYG to 
sign and ratify.  He said that because the parliament was new 
(constituted in May 2003), it could be some time before they 
could take up the protocols.  Post will follow-up and report 
as necessary. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Please advise if Arabic translations of the 
protocols are available.
