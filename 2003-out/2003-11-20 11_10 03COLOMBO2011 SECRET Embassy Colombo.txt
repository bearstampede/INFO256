¶1.  (SBU) We understand from AID that 04 global ESF levels 
are significantly lower than expected.  Any SA views on 
what this might mean?  (DCM)

GoRM has officially asked that their Guantanamo detainee be 
sent home.  (DCM) 
 
LATEST ON POLITICAL CRISIS 
-------------------------- 
¶3.  (C) FYI.  G.L. Peiris, key GSL peace process 
negotiator, reportedly made conciliatory remarks toward the 
President during his November 20 weekly press briefing.  He 
is quoted as stating that the President and her party 
should have a role in government decision-making.  In a 
separate conversation on November 20, Mano Tittawella, a 
presidential adviser, echoed Peiris' seemingly cooperative 
tone, saying that the both sides in the "Committee of 
Officials" have had friendly discussions.  The Ambassador 
and the DCM are scheduled to meet with Tittawella and Harim 
Peiris, her press spokesman, early next week and will check 
out how the discussions are faring at that time, a little 
longer into the committee process.  The fact that G.L. 
Peiris, who is usually a hard-liner toward the President, 
is speaking in such moderate tones could be a sign that the 
current crisis is abating.  (POL/ECON) 
 
SEIZURE OF UNMANNED SPY PLANES BY SL CUSTOMS 
------------------------------------------- 
¶4.  (C) FYI.  On November 20, the DAILY NEWS, an English 
language daily, reported that Sri Lankan customs officials 
had seized two unmanned spy planes and other sensitive 
radio equipment at the Colombo port.  Capable of either 
being fitted with photographic equipment or being loaded 
with explosives, the miniature aircraft were said to be the 
first to be detected in Sri Lanka.  The planes were 
unearthed in a container shipment sent by a firm that has 
been accused of smuggling goods in the past.  Although 
there is no indication of where the items were headed, the 
Tigers have attempted to gain airborne surveillance 
equipment in the past. (POL/DAO) 
 
EU COMMISSIONER TO VISIT HERE WEEK 
---------------------------------- 
¶5.  (C) FYI.  Chris Patten, the External Relations 
Commissioner for the European Council, will visit Sri Lanka 
from November 25-26.  According to the local EU mission, 
Patten is scheduled to meet with the President, PM, a host 
of MPs from the UNF, Opposition, and Muslim delegation, as 
well as the four co-chairs and civil society leaders. 
Patten is also slated to take a trip to Kilinochchi for a 
meeting with the Tigers.  At this point, he is slated to 
meet with Prabhakaran.  (POL)
