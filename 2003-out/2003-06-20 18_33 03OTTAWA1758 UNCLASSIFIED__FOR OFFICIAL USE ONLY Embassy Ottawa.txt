SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN FRIENDLY FIRE INCIDENT: CANADIAN 
REACTION TO DECISION NOT TO PROCEED WITH COURTS MARTIAL 
AGAINST U.S. PILOTS 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Canadian Government reacted very evenly to the 
June 19 decision by U.S. Air Force LTGEN Bruce Carlson not to 
proceed with courts martial against two pilots who mistakenly 
bombed Canadian troops in Afghanistan.  Prime Minister 
Chretien said the matter is now closed as far as the Canadian 
Government is concerned.  Canadian Chief of Defense Staff GEN 
Henault issued a statement expressing sympathy with the 
soldiers' families, reiterating the Canadian Forces' 
commitment to contributing to international peace and 
security (including in ISAF), and pledging to work with 
allies to mitigate the possibility of such incidents in the 
future. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The families of the four Canadian soldiers killed in 
the April 2002 incident said they had expected the decision, 
but most were upset that stronger action was not being taken 
against the two pilots.  A common refrain among the families 
was a concern that the pilots not be allowed to fly again for 
the U.S. Air Force.  One of the pilots will receive a 
reprimand and is leaving the Air Force.  The second pilot 
still faces disciplinary proceedings that could result in a 
reprimand, 30 days confinement to quarters, loss of one 
month's pay, and/or no longer being permitted to fly for the 
Air Force.  The family of one of the Canadian soldiers filed 
a wrongful death claim against the U.S. military earlier this 
year, and that case is ongoing. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: More than one year after the fact, there is 
a greater realization here now that the friendly fire 
incident, while tragic, is one of many affecting allied 
forces.  Canadians will continue to scrutinize disciplinary 
measures taken against the pilots, but most consider the Air 
Force's handling of the case thus far to have been 
even-handed.
