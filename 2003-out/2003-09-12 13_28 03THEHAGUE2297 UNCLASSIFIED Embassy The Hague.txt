SUBJECT: PASSENGER NAME RECORD DEMARCHE -- NETHERLANDS 
 
REF: STATE 253041 
 
¶1.     Post delivered reftel demarche on Passenger Name 
Record (PNR) data to Andre van Wiggen and Robert van Embden 
of the MFA's Division of Transport (Personenverkeer) on 
September 9.  Van Embden says the Dutch are working on 
answering our note, and he expects to have a "detailed" 
response to ref demarche during the week of September 15. 
Van Embden's office is leading a Dutch inter-agency process 
which involves the Ministries of Transport and Interior, and 
whose purposes are to study the implications of PNR and to 
develop the Netherlands' position. 
 
¶2.     Van Embden predicted that the European Council of 
Ministers transport committee will meet October 9 or 10 and 
it is likely that PNR/privacy issues will be on the agenda.
