Â¶1. Article in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El Heraldo" on 
9/18 entitled "Central America insists in protecting its 
agriculture against U.S. subsidies".  "The sensitive issue of 
market access was the main feature of the third day of the CAFTA 
round.  Once again, Central America insisted in protecting its 
sensitive industries against the `unfair competition' of U.S. 
products receiving subsidies from the U.S. government." 
 
"The concern of the Central American delegations increased after 
the WTO meeting in Cancun, where there was no agreement on the 
issue of subsidies to exports and other aid received by producers 
from rich countries, mainly in the U.S. and Europe." 
 
"Unknown sources stated that the U.S. has agreed to eliminate its 
subsidies to the exportation of agricultural products, but it's 
been reluctant to abolish other subsidies.  Apparently, this 
issue will not be addressed until the eighth and ninth rounds."
