SUBJECT: MEPI: POST PLAN TO SUPPORT GROWTH OF GOOD 
GOVERNANCE AND CITIZEN AWARENESS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 15081 
 
¶1.  POST'S INTERAGENCY MEPI COMMITTEE, CONSISTING OF USAID, 
POL, ECON AND PA HAS DEVELOPED THE FOLLOWING STRATEGY OVER 
THE NEXT YEAR TO ENCOURAGE GOOD GOVERNANCE IN JORDAN.  OUR 
PLAN AIMS TO STRENGTHEN CITIZEN AWARENESS AND ACTIVISM 
THROUGH NGO'S AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE 
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND THE COURTS.  GIVEN THE POLITICAL 
REALITIES OF JORDAN, WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO 
COOPERATE CLOSELY WITH THE GOJ, BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE CAN ONLY COME FROM AN ENLIGHTENED AND 
EMPOWERED JORDANIAN PEOPLE.  CONTINUED PROGRESS IN THE OTHER 
TWO MEPI PILLARS, ESPECIALLY ECONOMIC REFORM AND 
DEVELOPMENT, WILL ALSO HELP CREATE A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT 
FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE.  FOLLOWING IS OUR OVERALL PLAN, AND WE 
WILL REQUEST MEPI SUPPORT FOR SOME OF IT IN A "SCOPE OF WORK 
PROJECT FORMAT".   OTHER PROJECTS WILL BE FINANCED OUT OF 
THE PASA AGREEMENT RECENTLY SIGNED AT POST BETWEEN PUBLIC 
AFFAIRS AND USAID.  OUR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THESE 
ACTIVITIES WILL, OF COURSE, DEPEND VERY MUCH ON POLITICAL 
AND SECURITY CONDITIONS IN JORDAN.
