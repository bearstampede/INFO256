SUBJECT:  NUCLEAR PHYSICS LAB SHUT DOWN FOR ALLEGED 
POLLUTION 
 
 
    ¶1.  ON MAY 30, THE PRESS REPORTED THAT THE NATIONAL 
INSTITUTE OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS (INFN) GRAN SASSO LABORATORY 
WAS SHUT DOWN FOR ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION.  IN PARTICULAR, 
THE MAGISTRATE DECIDED TO KEEP THE HALL C SEALED, WHERE THE 
BOREXINO EXPERIMENT IS AND FROM WHERE PSEUDOCUMENE LEAKED 
INTO A RIVER LAST AUGUST.  NOTE.  THE LEAK WAS DUE TO A 
"HUMAN MISTAKE" - ACTUALLY TO LACK OF PERSONNEL BECAUSE OF 
THE SUMMER HOLIDAY - NOT A TO DAMAGED OR UNSAFE FILTERS. 
END NOTE. 
 
¶2.  HOWEVER, ON MAY 29 INFN DECIDED TO SUSPEND "ALL RESEARCH 
ACTIVITIES WHICH IMPLY THE USE OF ANY KIND OF LIQUID".  INFN 
PRESIDENT IAROCCI HAS ASKED THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY TO 
URGENTLY INSPECT ALL THE LABS AND FIX WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE 
REPAIRED SO THAT THE RESEARCH ACTIVITY COULD START AGAIN AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE.  ACCORDING TO IAROCCI'S ASSISTANT, THIS IS 
THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE CONTINUOUS ATTACKS AND ACCUSATIONS 
FROM SEVERAL GREEN NGO'S.  SKODON
