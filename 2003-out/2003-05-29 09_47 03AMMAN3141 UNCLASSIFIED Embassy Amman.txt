CANDIDATES FOR THE MIDDLE EAST REGIONAL JUSTICE FORUM IN 
BAHRAIN: 
- H.E. MOHAMMAD AL RAQQAD, HEAD OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL; 
- H.E. FARES NABULSI, MINISTER OF JUSTICE; 
- MS. REEM ABU HASSAN, LAWYER AND KEY PLAYER IN REFORM 
EFFORTS; 
 
PLEASE NOTE THAT THE ABOVE THREE WERE NOT APPROACHED PER 
YOUR REQUEST. 
 
¶2. POST HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN LEGAL REFORM EFFORTS IN JORDAN 
FOR THE PAST 8 YEARS AND IS INTERESTED IN HOSTING FOLLOW UP 
TRAINING SESSIONS AND ACTIVITIES.  AS A RESULT OF THIS 
EFFORT, JORDAN HAS RECENTLY ADOPTED CASE MANAGEMENT AND 
MEDIATION AS PART OF THEIR JUDICIAL SYSTEM WITH THE 
OBJECTIVE OF REDUCING THE COURTS' CASE LOAD AND TO ENCOURAGE 
FOREIGN INVESTMENT.  WE BELIEVE THAT JORDANIAN JUDGES AND 
LAWYERS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO SHARE THEIR EXPERTISE WITH 
OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION.
