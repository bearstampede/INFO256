End Report 
 
2.(C) Explanatory Comments: 
 
Wafra Joint Operations refer to onshore concessions in 
Saudi-Kuwait divided zone operated by Saudi Arabian Texaco 
(SAT).  R/B refers to the two producing reservoirs -- Ratawi 
and Burgan. 
 
KOC is Kuwait Oil Company 
KNPC is Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation 
 
KGOC is the Kuwaiti successor to Arabian Oil Company (AOC), 
which previously operated a concession in the offshore 
portions of the Saudi-Kuwait divided zone -- AOC still 
operates the fields under a service agreement. 
 
KEC refers to Kuwait Export Crude, the country's export 
blend.  Salt PTB appears to refer to pounds of salt per 
thousand barrels of crude oil; however, a senior KPC official 
tells us the 'T' is extraneous and the term refers to 'parts 
per billion.'
