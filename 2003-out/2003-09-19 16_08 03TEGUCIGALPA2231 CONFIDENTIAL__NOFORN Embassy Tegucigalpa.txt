(1-B.) Yes.  There have been more than seven demonstrations 
in Tegucigalpa since December 2002, either at the Embassy or 
nearby locations.  Demo dates:  12/5/02, 01/25/03, 01/30/03, 
02/15/03, 03/8/03 and 03/27/03. 
 
(1-C.)  Over half of the demonstrations have taken place at 
or near the Embassy. 
 
(1-D.)  The size of anti-American demonstrations at the 
Embassy varies from twenty to over three hundred 
participants.  The larger demos usually consist of supporters 
from six to more than twelve different organizations, which 
operate as a loosely structured coalition under the guidance 
of Bloque Popular. 
 
(1-E.)  While there are demonstrations based on local issues, 
such as civil service salaries, privatization, IMF 
requirements, etc.  U.S. actions in Iraq and the Central 
American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) have become the current 
focus.  The following statements/demands have been made 
repeatedly during past demos at the Embassy:  No to war in 
Iraq, No to war, Stop plan Colombia, Pro-Human rights, World 
Peace, Stop Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), 
U.S. Forces out of Honduras (Soto Cano AB), Burning US flags, 
U.S. Military out of Cuba, U.S. destroy your WMD, Stop 
intervention in Venezuela, Stop Standard Fruit exploiting the 
indigenous people, No to CAFTA, No to privatization. 
 
(1-F.)  Generally peaceful, but demonstrators have burned 
U.S. flags, painted slogans on Mission outer perimeter walls 
and utilized homemade mortars to detonate large fireworks 
charges that are propelled high into the air before exploding. 
 
(1-G.)  N/A. 
 
(1-H.)  N/A. 
 
(1-I.)  Yes. 
 
(1-J.)  Yes.  Occasionally they will pass by the Embassy. 
 
(1-K.)  The size varies from a few hundred to 5-10 thousand 
people. 
 
(1-L.)  Generally peaceful but fences, grillwork and windows 
have been destroyed near the National Congress and many tires 
burned.  At times suspected plain-clothes police have been 
held and beaten by hard-core protestors within the 
demonstrations. 
 
(1-M.)  N/A. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Macro Conflict Conditions: 
 
(2-A.)  NO. 
 
(2-B.)  N/A. 
 
(2-C.)  N/A. 
 
(2-D.)  N/A. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Host Country Capabilities: 
 
(3-A.)  No. 
 
(3-B.)  Yes.  Training by US Border Patrol(BorTac) Teams 
good, but GOH security infrastructure needs major 
improvements. 
 
(3-C.)  Yes. 
 
(3-D.)  No.  However, GOH intelligence units have an 
institutional awareness of and a modest capability of 
penetrating indigenous radical groups. 
 
(3-E.)  Yes. 
 
(3-F.)  No. 
 
(3-G.)  Yes. 
 
(3-H.)  Average/Below Average. 
 
(3-I.)  Average/Ineffective. 
 
(3-J.)  Average/Ineffective.  A new unit within the Ministry 
of Public Security called the Frontier Police has been 
established to handle border patrol duties.  The unit is 
making positive steps towards border control but lack of 
funding and manpower are limiting the effectiveness of the 
unit. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Indigenous Terrorism-Anti American Terrorist 
Groups: 
 
(4-A.)  No. 
 
(4-B.)  N/A.

(4-E.)  N/A. 
 
(4-F.)  N/A. 
(4-G.)  N/A.

(5-B.)  N/A. 
 
(5-C.)  N/A. 
 
(5-D.)  N/A. 
 
(5-E.)  N/A. 
 
¶6. (C/NF)  Transnational Terrorism-Transnational Terrorist 
Indicators: 
 
(6-A.)  No.  However, there are rumors that there are Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty (ETA), IRA, and Chiapas (Zapatistas) 
sympathizers in Honduras who could be involved in advising 
indigenous groups.  Some Hondurans are studying in Cuba and 
also conceivably could be receiving training in subversion 
and terrorism, although it is more likely they are being 
indoctrinated as agents of influence.   As this Cuban program 
for Hondurans is in its infancy, there have been no 
indications that such training is taking place. 
 
(6-B.)  N/A. 
 
(6-C.)  N/A. 
 
(6-D.)  N/A and NO. 
 
(6-E.)  N/A. 
 
(6-F.)  The only known hostile intelligence presence of note 
is Cuban.  While the Cuban mission appears to have extensive 
contacts with leftists and indigenous groups, there is no 
indication they are planning or supporting terrorism. 
 
(6-H.)  There is no shortage of weapons in Honduras.  It 
would also not be difficult for hostile terrorist elements to 
import weapons and/or explosives from neighboring countries.
