SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED TO JORDAN ON REORGANIZATION OF 
IRAQI MFA AND RECALL OF COM 
 
REF: (A) STATE 126507 (B) STATE 114629 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). 
 
¶1. (SBU) On May 14, A/DCM conveyed ref A points to Ali 
Al-Ayed, personal assistant to FonMin Muasher.  Al-Ayed took 
down all the information without offering any substantive 
comment. 
 
¶2. (C)  On May 15, al-Ayed contacted A/Polcouns inquiring how 
the information on the reorganized Iraqi MFA related to the 
status of Jordanian Embassy officials in Baghdad.  A/PolCouns 
noted that ref A message did not address that issue 
specifically and reiterated points contained in Ref B that, 
as of the latest guidance, diplomatic privileges/immunities 
of diplomatic or consular officials who have remained in 
Baghdad can no longer be honored.  Regarding practical 
coordination on specific issues, however, Jordanian diplomats 
currently in Baghdad should contact ORHA.
