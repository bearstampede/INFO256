SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION ON THE VISIT OF SECRETARY OF DEFENSE 
DONALD H. RUMSFELD TO HONDURAS, AUGUST 20, 2003 
 
Â¶1. Editorial in San Pedro Sula-based liberal daily "La Prensa" on 
8/25 entitled "The agenda".  "The fact that the issue of 
narcotrafficking came up during the recent visit of the U.S. 
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is undeniable.  What we 
 
SIPDIS 
don't know is the scope of these discussions and the proposals 
presented by Rumsfeld to the Maduro administration." 
 
"Despite the fact that President Maduro denied a future 
installation of an anti-drug base in our territory, there are 
still some doubts in the air, because Secretary Rumsfeld came to 
Honduras after he visited Colombia.  It's evident that the U.S. 
government makes a lot of demands, but doesn't always help to 
achieve what it wants."
