Â¶1.  The Ministry of Defense today officially indicated 
its intent to co-host, with the United States Army 
Pacific, the annual Peacekeeping Multi-Platoon Event 
(PKO-MPE) in 2004.  The Army Commander, LTG Balagalle has 
directed his staff to investigate establishment of a 
peacekeeping school for the Army and sought approval 
through MOD to host this event as a way of showing Sri 
Lanka's serious intent to participate in peacekeeping 
operations in the future.  The Army currently has four 
Military Observers serving on UNPKOs in the Near East and 
two officers attending the US-funded peacekeeping school 
in Bangladesh.  The MPE was held in years past in 
Bangladesh and Nepal and is attended by platoons from 
South Asian nations, the United States and the United 
Nations.
