Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
¶2. (C) On August 8, polmiloff passed reftel paper to Omur 
Yurdakul, First Secretary in the MFA's Disarmament 
Department. Yurdakul indicated that the GOT would likely 
support all three reftel proposals at the MTCR plenary. 
Yurdakul also noted that the GOT is working to implement 
catch-all controls officially, but that it already, in 
practice, acts as if such controls are on the books. 
 
 
¶3. (U) Yurdakul said that the head of the Turkish delegation 
to the MTCR plenary will be the Turkish Ambassador to 
Argentina. Yurdakul will attend for the MFA. Five other 
officials from Ankara will also attend: two from the Turkish 
General Staff, one from the Ministry of National Defense, one 
from the Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade, and one from the 
Customs department.
