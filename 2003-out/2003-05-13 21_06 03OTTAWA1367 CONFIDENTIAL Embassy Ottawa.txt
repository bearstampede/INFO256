SUBJECT: CANADA: STATUS OF LOCAL LAWS IMPLEMENTING IRAQ 
SANCTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 123640 
 
Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). 
 
1.(C) We raised the questions contained in reftel with 
Christopher Hull, Iraq political and trade relations officer 
in DFAIT's Middle East Division, on May 13. Hull indicated 
that Canada had regulations in place (known as the UN/Iraq 
regulations) to implement its obligations under UNSCR 661 and 
other Iraq UNSC resolutions. Hull said there are two options 
for undoing the regulations once the UNSC lifts the Iraq 
sanctions: the current regulations can either be modified, or 
the current regulations can be repealed altogether. He 
indicated that adoption of the sanctions-lift resolution 
would not be sufficient in itself to permit import and trade 
in Iraqi products; some action will have to be taken 
regarding Canada's UN/Iraq regulations. 
 
Â¶2. (C) As to the time required, Hull said that the repeal of 
the regulations could be accomplished fairly quickly. 
However, if the regulations are either modified or replaced 
with new regulations, this would take longer.  He noted that 
the process of repealing them would be initiated by DFAIT, go 
to the Privy Council for review, and then to the Governor 
General for formal approval.  Hull felt it would be difficult 
to begin the process before UNSC adoption of the 
sanctions-lift resolution, although he promised to  confer 
with DFAIT's legal division on this point.
