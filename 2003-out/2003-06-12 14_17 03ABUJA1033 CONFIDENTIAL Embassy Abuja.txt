CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) 
AND (D). 
 
 
¶1.  (C) During a June 11 meeting with President Obasanjo on 
Article 98 and security assistance issues (SEPTEL), 
Ambassador Jeter explained the ramifications of not 
concluding an Article 98 agreement by the July 1 deadline. 
Obasanjo said he was in favor of Article 98.  He thought 
such agreements were necessary to "protect" Nigerian 
soldiers and commented that Nigeria would "not participate 
in peacekeeping" operations without such agreements. 
 
 
¶2.  (C) These statements indicate that Obasanjo is thinking 
differently than some of his former Ministers.  Former 
Minister of Defense Danjuma told DCM June 7 that the inter- 
ministerial committee set up to examine Article 98 opposed 
the agreement (REF C).  During the Ambassador's 
conversation with the President, however, Obasanjo seemed 
uninformed about the inter-ministerial committee's 
recommendation.  Also, there was some confusion amongst the 
advisors present as to whether the inter-ministerial 
committee had actually met. 
 
 
¶3.  (C) COMMENT: Obasanjo's support for an Article 98 
agreement is welcome but it does put him at odds with many 
of his advisors.  Thus, this matter may not be settled 
despite the strong indication given by Obasanjo in his 
meeting with the Ambassador.  During a private aside at 
that meeting, Ambassador Jeter mentioned to Obasanjo that 
Danjuma had said Nigeria would follow South Africa's lead 
and not sign Article 98 (REF C AND D).  Obasanjo retorted 
that Nigeria was sovereign and would make its own decisions 
based on its interests, not South Africa's. 
 
 
¶4.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: In the final analysis, 
Obasanjo's meeting with this ad-hoc committee or his 
reaction to its report (should the meeting already have 
taken place but not yet reported to Obasanjo) will likely 
determine if Nigeria signs an Article 98 agreement.  While 
it would not be unprecedented for the Obasanjo to disregard 
the counsel of his advisors if he has his own strong 
convictions about an issue, it is too soon to predict.  END 
COMMENT.
