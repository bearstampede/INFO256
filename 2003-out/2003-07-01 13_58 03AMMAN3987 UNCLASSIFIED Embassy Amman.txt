SUBJECT: TRIAL OF ACCUSED IN FOLEY ASSASSINATION POSTPONED 
AGAIN 
 
Â¶1. (U) Local press reported on July 1 that the trial of five 
men (six additional suspects are being tried in absentia) 
accused of murdering US diplomat Laurence Foley has been 
postponed for a week.  One of the accused, Libyan national 
Salem Said Bin Sewid, requested the State Security Court 
release his current attorney and appoint him an attorney from 
the Jordan Bar Association (JBA).  The President of the JBA, 
who is representing co-defendant Yasser Fathi, asked the 
court for some time to examine Sewid's case to see if he 
might represent both defendants.  The Presiding Judge granted 
him a week.  The trial should resume on July 8.
