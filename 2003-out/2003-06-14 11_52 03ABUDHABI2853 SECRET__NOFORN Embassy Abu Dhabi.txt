¶1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA 
FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶2.  (S/NF) Ambassador used the opportunity of a 
June 10 meeting with de facto Foreign Minister 
Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayid (other topic septel, notal) 
to discuss the status of Human Appeal 
International.  The Ambassador noted that we would 
be providing an intel package on HAI to assist the 
UAEG with its own investigation.  Shaykh Hamdan 
reiterated his commitment -- reported Ref A -- to 
taking concrete action against HAI.  The Ambassador 
asked whether there had been any result as yet from 
the UAE's examination of HAI activities in 
Mauritania, following the GIRM's decision to close 
the HAI office in Nouakchott.  Shaykh Hamdan said 
the UAEG had deployed a fact-finding team to 
Nouakchott, but that the coup attempt in Mauritania 
had temporarily set back the investigation; he 
nonetheless reiterated his commitment to share with 
us the results of that investigation as soon as it 
is completed and once again noted that any 
ammunition the USG could provice regarding HAI's 
support for terrorism would help in the effort to 
thoroughly rehabilitate the charity.
