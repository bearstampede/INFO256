SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN UPDATE FOR CROATIA 
 
REF: STATE 259174 
 
¶1.  EMBASSY ZAGREB'S PRINCIPAL BLUE LANTERN CONTACT IS 
POL-MIL OFFICER ANTHONY GODFREY, TEL 385-1-661-2260, FAX 
385-1-661-2178, EMAIL: GODFREYA@STATE.GOV.  GODFREY IS 
EXPECTED TO DEPART POST IN LATE JUNE 2004. 

¶2.  EMBASSY ZAGREB USES A TEAM APPROACH AND TAKES BLUE 
LANTERN CHECKS SERIOUSLY.  OVERSIGHT OF THE BLUE LANTERN 
PROCESS IS CARRIED OUT BY THE DCM.  POST'S DEFENSE ATTACHE 
OFFICE AND OFFICE OF DEFENSE COOPERATION ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE 
IN BLUE LANTERN CHECKS, AS DOES THE FCS OFFICE, WHEN 
APPROPRIATE.  POST HAS A RECORD OF CARRYING OUT BLUE LANTERN 
CHECKS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AFTER RECEIPT. 
 
¶3.  THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH POST IMPLEMENTS THE BLUE LANTERN 
PROGRAM CONTINUES TO IMPROVE.  A LOOSELY-ENFORCED UN WEAPONS 
EMBARGO FORCED CROATIA TO SEEK SOURCES OF WEAPONS OUTSIDE 
NORMAL GOVERNMENT CHANNELS DURING ITS "HOMELAND WAR" THROUGH 
MID-1995.  CROATIA BEGAN TO IMPROVE CONTROLS OF DEFENSE TRADE 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WAR.  NOW, AS A SERIOUS ASPIRANT FOR AN 
INVITATION TO JOIN NATO, THE GOC HAS SHARPLY INCREASED 
GOVERNMENT CONTROLS OVER THE TRADE IN WEAPONS AND MUNITIONS. 
POST'S OFFICE OF DEFENSE COOPERATION MAINTAINS ACTIVE 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH MOST POTENTIAL RECIPIENTS OF U.S. - ORIGIN 
DEFENSE ARTICLES AND SERVICES SOLD COMMERCIALLY.  LEGITIMATE 
DEALERS AND SEVERAL OF CROATIA'S ARMS MANUFACTURERS HAVE 
ENTERED INTO COOPERATIVE COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH U.S. 
FIRMS AND ARE EAGER TO COOPERATE WITH BLUE LANTERN CHECKS.
