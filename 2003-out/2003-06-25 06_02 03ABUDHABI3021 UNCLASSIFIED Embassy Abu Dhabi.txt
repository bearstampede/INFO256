¶6. VIEWS AND COMMENTS: 
 
DESPITE THE MOUNTING TENSION IN THE REGION BECAUSE OF 
THE IMPENDING IRAQ WAR, MOST OF THE U.S. EXHIBITORS 
WERE PLEASED WITH THE SHOW AND EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT IDEX IN MARCH OF 2005.  IN 
GENERAL, THEY WERE VERY PLEASED WITH THE PAVILION 
ORGANIZATION BY AUSA AND CS STAFF SUPPORT AND 
ASSISTANCE.  FOLLOWING ARE EXCERPTS OF THE EXHIBITOR'S 
COMMENTS TAKEN FROM THE MISSION/EXHIBITION EVALUATION 
FORM: 
 
"EXCELLENT SHOW FOR CONTACTS AND FOLLOW-UP ON SALES 
OPPORTUNITIES" 
FIRE ARMS TRAINING SYSTEMS 
 
"THE US COMMERCIAL SERVICE STAFF EXTENDED THEIR FULL 
SUPPORT TO OUR ACTIVITIES DURING THE SHOW" 
HORTON EMERGENCY VEHICLES 
 
"SHOW ALLOWS DIRECT INTERFACE WITH UAE CUSTOMERS AND 
POTENTIAL MIDDLE EAST CUSTOMERS" 
GOODRICH CORPORATION 
 
"PROVIDED STRATEGIC MARKET CONTACTS AND CUT LEAD TIME 
FOR MARKET ENTRY" 
ATN 
 
THE MAIN COMPLAINT FROM SEVERAL EXHIBITORS WHO HAD 
ATTENDED PREVIOUS IDEXES WAS A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER 
OF HIGH-LEVEL DELEGATIONS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.  IN 
ADDITION, DEFENSE OBSERVERS NOTED THAT DEFENSE 
EXPENDITURES HAVE PEAKS AND VALLEYS, AND THIS COULD 
HAVE BEEN A "VALLEY" YEAR. 
 
¶7. RESULTS: 
 
U.S. PAVILION PARTICIPANTS OBTAINED OVER 1,000 SALES 
LEADS DURING THE 5 DAYS AND PROJECTED SEVERAL MILLION 
US DOLLARS IN SALES OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AS A RESULT 
OF SHOW CONTACTS. OVER $70 MILLION IN SALES WERE MADE 
PUBLIC BY LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES EXHIBITING 
AT IDEX 2003 DURING THE EVENT. 
 
¶8. COMMENTS: 
 
IDEX OFFERS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR U.S. DEFENSE 
FIRMS TO PURSUE EXPORT SALES AND DEVELOP BUSINESS 
CONTACTS NOT ONLY IN THE UAE BUT ALSO IN OTHER MARKETS 
OF THE REGION. IDEX HAS CARVED A DISTINCTIVE NICHE FOR 
ITSELF AMONG THE WORLD'S TOP DEFENSE EXHIBITIONS.  OVER 
150 PUBLICATIONS AND NEWS ORGANIZATIONS WERE COVERING 
THE SHOW. CS UAE SUPPORTS CONTINUED USDOC CERTIFICATION 
FOR IDEX. THE POTENTIAL RESULTS FOR A VARIETY OF U.S. 
COMPANIES, INCLUDING NTM FIRMS, MAKES THIS WELL WORTH 
THE CONSIDERABLE EFFORT EXPENDED BY CS UAE AND THE 
EMBASSY.
