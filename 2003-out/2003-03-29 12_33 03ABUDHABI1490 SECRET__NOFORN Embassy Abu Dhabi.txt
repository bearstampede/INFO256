SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCING:  POST VETTING OF 
MARCH 27 TARGET LIST 
 
REF:  STATE 79970 
 
¶1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA 
FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶2.  (S/NF) Post does not believe that the proposed 
listing of Pacha Wazir or Haji Wali Muhammad will 
pose any difficulties for the UAEG.  However, we 
are very concerned about the potential for a strong 
negative reaction from the UAEG with regard to 
Human Appeal International.  Human Appeal, based in 
Ajman, is one of the largest charitable 
institutions in the UAE and is closely associated 
(and operates under the patronage of) the ruling 
family of Ajman Emirate.  Any public listing of 
Human Appeal as a terrorist financing entity will 
create serious difficulties for the UAE Government 
and could result -- at minimum -- in a substantial 
reduction in our heretofore stellar partnership 
with the UAE on terrorist financing issues. 
 
¶3.  (S/NF)  We are aware that Human Appeal in the 
past provided assistance to certain Chechen 
organizations subsequently deemed to be 
inappropriate by the USG.  We took that matter to 
the UAE authorities and they promptly took action, 
promising that these activities would cease.  We 
are also aware of allegations by Bosnian officials 
with regard to the operations of the Bosnia office 
of Human Appeal.  However, we have not seen any 
evidence to suggest that Human Appeal as an 
organization is male fide or deliberately and 
primarily involved in terrorist financing; if there 
is such evidence we would like to see it.  Should 
such evidence exist and be compelling, we would 
still argue that, as in the past here, the UAE 
authorities would no doubt strongly prefer to act 
against the organization themselves -- forcefully, 
but quietly -- upon the presentation of our case. 
But to publicly embarrass such a prominent 
organization, and one with close connections to the 
rulers of Ajman, by publicly designating it would 
be an affront which Emirati authorities could not 
accept. 
 
¶4.  (S/NF)  We would note that, subsequent to the 
9/11 attacks, the Emirate of Dubai established a 
council tasked with vetting the activities of all 
the various charitable organizations based in the 
northern Emirates.  We have also been told that 
overseas transfers of funds by UAE-based charities 
are now closely scrutinized and that the boards of 
directors of charities have been subjected to 
background checks by the UAE's State Security 
Department.  Clearly, Emirati officials are well 
aware of the importance of preventing the misuse of 
charitable funds by terrorists and terrorist 
financers.  We suggest Human Appeal be dropped 
entirely from consideration for designation. 
However, should the Terrorist Financing PCC believe 
there to be a compelling, documentable case against 
Human Appeal, we believe a private approach to the 
UAEG will likely prove far more effective than 
public designation -- and will reflect the spirit 
of our ongoing cooperation on terrorist financing 
issues.
