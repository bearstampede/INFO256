SUBJECT: IAEA/IRAN: CANADIAN DEMARCHE TO EL-BARADEI 
 
REF: (A) OTTAWA 963 (B) STATE 79477

Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
(C) Further to reftel discussions, Foreign Affairs informed 
us that the Canadian Head of Mission in Vienna met with IAEA 
DG El-Baradei on April 7 to urge him to take a tough approach 
on Iran's nuclear program.  El-Baradei responded by defending 
his non-confrontational approach, and gave no indication that 
he intends to change course.  Foreign Affairs noted that the 
Canadian Head of Mission is still planning to host a luncheon 
on April 10 for like-minded IAEA member countries to discuss 
Iran.  Canada is trying to attract a more broadly 
representative group than the one that met on North Korea, 
and hopes that some NAM countries will join.
