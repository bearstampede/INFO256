SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. A TEAM LED BY AMBASSADOR TONY HALL AND AA/DCHA ROGER 
WINTER VISITED ETHIOPIA FEBRUARY 15-21 AND FOUND THE COUNTRY 
WITH THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 
STRUGGLING TO CONTAIN A MAJOR HUMANITARIAN DISASTER. IN 
2003, SOME 11.3 MILLION DROUGHT VICTIMS WILL REQUIRE ABOUT 
1.4 MILLION TONS OF FOOD ASSISTANCE AND AN ADDITIONAL 3 
MILLION WILL NEED TO BE CLOSELY MONITORED. WITH 20 PERCENT 
OF ETHIOPIA'S POPULATION AT RISK, UNLESS DEFTLY HANDLED, 
2003 COULD WELL BECOME A CRISIS OF SIMILAR MAGNITUDE TO THE 
CATASTROPHE OF 1984 WHEN ONE MILLION PEOPLE DIED. GIVEN THE 
DEPTH AND WIDE GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD OF THE HUNGER, GREATER

PAGE 03        ROME  00760  01 OF 06  241650Z 
LEADERSHIP AND INVOLVEMENT OF THE UNITED NATIONS AT THE 
COUNTRY LEVEL IS REQUIRED. AND DONOR CAPITALS NEED TO BE 
SEIZED WITH A HEIGHTENED SENSE OF URGENCY. END SUMMARY.

¶2. AMBASSADOR TONY HALL, US MISSION TO ROME; AA/DCHA ROGER 
WINTER; ROME HUMANITARIAN ATTACHE, TIM LAVELLE; AND SPECIAL 
ASSISTANT TO THE AA/DCHA, JENNY MARION - VISITED ETHIOPIA 
FEBRUARY 15-21. IN ADDITION TO MEETINGS IN ADDIS ABABA WITH 
U.S. EMBASSY/USAID, UNITED NATIONS, NON-GOVERNMENTAL 
ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) AND GFDRE FUNCTIONARIES, THE TEAM SPENT 
SEVERAL DAYS IN RURAL AREAS REVIEWING WORLD FOOD PROGRAM AND 
NGO IMMEDIATE RELIEF AND LONGER-TERM OPERATIONS. 
 
¶3. ETHIOPIA HAS THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION IN SUB-SAHARAN 
AFRICA AND AN ANNUAL PER CAPITA INCOME OF ONLY U.S. 100 
DOLLARS. THE COUNTRY IS ONCE AGAIN FACED WITH THE THREAT OF 
FAMINE. IN 2003, SOME 11.3 MILLION DROUGHT VICTIMS WILL 
REQUIRE ABOUT 1.3 MILLION TONS OF FOOD GRAINS AND 125,000 
METRIC TONS OF ENRICHED FOODS. AN ADDITIONAL 3 MILLION 
POTENTIALLY AT-RISK WILL NEED TO BE CLOSELY MONITORED. NOTE: 
AMBASSADOR HALL, WHO TRAVELED IN THE RURAL ETHIOPIAN 
HIGHLANDS IN 1984 AND A NUMBER OF TIMES SINCE THEN, FOUND 
THE PRESENT SITUATION "EVEN WORSE THAN I EXPECTED. THERE IS 
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MALNUTRITION, AND I AM NUMBED BY THE 
SHEER NUMBERS OF ACUTELY MALNOURISHED CHILDREN." END NOTE.

PAGE 04        ROME  00760  01 OF 06  241650Z 
 
¶4. SECURING A SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY OF FOOD FOR ITS PEOPLE HAS 
BEEN A PRIORITY OF THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT AND DONORS FOR 
20 YEARS. IN SPITE OF GOOD EFFORTS, FOOD INSECURITY REMAINS 
THE COUNTRY'S MOST DEEP-ROOTED PROBLEM. THE CATASTROPHIC 
FAMINE OF 1984-85 WAS FOLLOWED BY SERIOUS FOOD SHORTAGES IN 
1992, 1994, 2000 AND 2002. (THERE HAVE BEEN 15 DROUGHTS 
SINCE 1965.) NOTE: OF THE COUNTRY'S 67.2 MILLION, ALMOST 
HALF - 28 MILLION - LIVE IN DEEP AND LONG-TERM POVERTY, AND 
ARE VULNERABLE TO DROUGHT, ACUTE MALNUTRITION AND EVEN, AT 
EXTREME MOMENTS, TO STARVATION. END NOTE. 
 
¶5. A NOVEMBER 2002 MULTI-AGENCY PRE-HARVEST ASSESSMENT 
CONFIRMED WIDESPREAD CROP FAILURES IN LOWLAND AREAS IN THE 
NORTH, EAST, SOUTH AND CENTRAL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. SOME 
MIDLAND AREAS ARE ALSO BADLY AFFECTED. A NUMBER OF 
TRADITIONAL SURPLUS-PRODUCING AREAS OF THE COUNTRY HAVE ALSO 
BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED, REDUCING NATIONAL FOOD 
AVAILABILITY.

WORSE THAN I EXPECTED. ETHIOPIA IS ONCE AGAIN FACED WITH THE 
THREAT OF FAMINE." 
 
¶6. OVERALL, THE FOOD SECURITY SITUATION BOTH IN THE CROPPING 
AND PASTORAL AREAS IS POOR. RECOURSE TO MARKETS IS LIMITED 
BECAUSE OF LOW OR LACK OF PURCHASING POWER AND CEREAL PRICE 
HIKES (UP 20-30 PERCENT IN MANY AREAS COMPARED WITH A YEAR 
AGO) - AND FALLING LIVESTOCK PRICES. AND IT IS EVIDENT THAT 
THE 2000 AND 2002 DROUGHTS HAD FOR MANY A WITHERING IMPACT 
ON HOUSEHOLD ASSETS.

WHAT THE TEAM SAW 
----------------- 
 
¶7. AMBASSADOR HALL AND TIM LAVELLE TRAVELED TO THE EAST 
SHEWA (NAZARETH) ZONE AND ARSI, OROMIYA REGION 
(TRADITIONALLY A FOOD SURPLUS AREA) AND REVIEWED WFP- 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  00760  02 OF 06  241650Z 
SUPPORTED FOOD-FOR-ASSETS CREATION AND PROTECTION. WFP, 
WORKING THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, IS SUCCESSFULLY 
PROMOTING ACTIVITIES AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL FOCUSED ON 
BUILDING SKILLS AND INFRASTRUCTURE (PONDS, GULLY CONTROL, 
REFORESTATION, ETC) THROUGH PUBLIC WORKS SUPPORTED BY FOOD 
ASSISTANCE. DROUGHT-RELATED GENERAL DISTRIBUTIONS WERE ALSO 
OBSERVED. NOTE: TOO LITTLE INVESTMENT HAS BEEN MADE IN 
IRRIGATION OR OTHER SYSTEMS TO MANAGE WATER SUPPLY - ONLY 
ABOUT 5 PERCENT OF ETHIOPIA'S POTENTIALLY IRRIGABLE LAND IS 
PRESENTLY IRRIGATED. END NOTE. 
 
¶8. THE ENTIRE TEAM VISITED THE SOUTHERN, NATIONS AND 
NATIONALITIES, PEOPLES REGION (SNNPR) WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF 
ETHIOPIA'S (GFDRE) COMMISSIONER FOR DISASTER PREVENTION AND 
PREPAREDNESS (DPPC) AND REVIEWED ACTIVITIES OF WORLD VISION, 
THE IRISH-NGO PROJECT CONCERN AND AN ETHIOPIAN NON- 
GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION, PROJECT MERCY. THESE NGOS ARE 
PERFORMING IN A TRULY EXEMPLARY MANNER IN IDENTIFYING GAPS 
AND PROVIDING SUPPORT WHERE GOVERNMENT SERVICES ARE WEAK OR 
UNADAPTED TO LOCAL NEEDS. THEY ARE POWERFUL INSTRUMENTS IN 
PROMOTING PEOPLE'S PARTICIPATION IN DEVELOPMENT AND GIVING A 
VOICE TO THE POOR. AND WHILE THEY ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING 
WITH AND STRENGTHENING THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, IT 
WAS GRATIFYING TO SEE THAT THE GFDRE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS IS 
INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZING NGOS AS AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT 
FORCE AND PARTNER. NOTE: WORLD VISION'S OWN 2003 PLANNED 
CONTRIBUTION (RELIEF AND DEVELOPMENT) TO ETHIOPIA IS A TRULY 
IMPRESSIVE U.S. 17 MILLION DOLLARS. END NOTE. 
 
¶9. THE "INVESTMENTS" OF WORLD VISION AND LIKE-MINDED NGOS 
AND DONORS IN THE ENHANCEMENT OF PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  00760  02 OF 06  241650Z 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE CAN, IF PLANNED 
WELL, GO HAND-IN-HAND WITH THE DELIVERY OF LIFE-SAVING FOOD 
AID. THE PROJECTS THAT WE SAW AMPLY DEMONSTRATED THAT IT IS 
POSSIBLE TO BUILD A PLATFORM FROM WHICH PEOPLE CAN, WITH 
COMPLEMENTARY DEVELOPMENT INTERVENTIONS, GRADUATE OUT OF 
EMERGENCY RELIEF.

¶10. PROJECT MERCY, STARTED IN 1977 BY AN ETHIOPIAN REFUGEE 
COUPLE (MARTA GABRE-TSADICK AND DEMME TEKLE-WOLD) IS A FORT 
WAYNE, INDIANA REGISTERED NGO WHICH MINISTERS TO THE 
PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL NEEDS OF AFRICAN REFUGEES. IN YETEBON 
(GURAGUE ZONE, SNNPR), PROJECT MERCY IS FOCUSED ON HEALTH, 
AGRICULTURE, EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING OF THE LOCAL 
POPULATION. TO DATE, PROJECT MERCY'S ACTIVITIES IN YETEBON 
(1993-PRESENT) HAVE BEEN FUNDED (U.S. DOLLARS 4.43 MILLION)

¶11. TODAY, ETHIOPIA HAS THE THIRD LARGEST NUMBER OF HIV/AIDS 
POSITIVE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD - OVER 3 MILLION AFFECTED, 
250,000 ARE CHILDREN UNDER-FIVE AND THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 
ONE MILLION HIV/AIDS ORPHANS. THE TEAM WAS INFORMED THAT THE 
PRESENT DEVASTATING DROUGHT WILL ONLY SPIRAL THESE NUMBERS 
UPWARDS AS DROUGHT VICTIMS INCREASINGLY MIGRATE TO URBAN 
AREAS, EVEN IF ONLY TEMPORARILY. IN A COUNTRY WHERE 
POTENTIAL HEALTH SERVICE COVERAGE HOVERS AROUND 50 PERCENT, 
COMBATING THE SPREAD OF HIV/AIDS HAS TO BE TAKEN ON BOARD AT 
ALL LEVELS (GOVERNMENT, UN, NGOS, CIVIL SOCIETY) AS A 
FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE THAT IS POISED TO WIPE OUT THE LAST 
TWO DECADES OF DEVELOPMENT. A PROJECT MERCY DOCTOR WHO 
TRAVELED TO A CATHOLIC CHURCH-RUN HOSPITAL IN THE VALLEY 
BEYOND THE YETEBON HILL INFORMED THAT THE MAJORITY OF BEDS 
THERE WERE FILLED WITH AIDS PATIENTS. NOTE: PROJECT MERCY'S 
HOSPITAL WILL OPEN ITS DOORS THIS MAY. END NOTE. AMBASSADOR 
HALL INTERVIEWED A YOUNG MARRIED WOMAN AT A SNNPR FOOD 
DISTRIBUTION SITE. "HAVE YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND DISCUSSED 
HIV/AIDS?" "YES, WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT." "DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
CAUSES IT AND HOW IT CAN BE PREVENTED?" "NO, WE DO NOT."

¶12. WHILE THE UNITED STATES (WITH A COMMITMENT TO DATE OF 
289,000 MTS) HAS RESPONDED GENEROUSLY TO THE 2003 JOINT 
GFDRE/UN FOOD AID APPEAL FOR 1.44 METRIC TONS, GIVEN THE 
GRAVITY OF THE PRESENT SITUATION, A FURTHER COMMITMENT OF

PAGE 04        ROME  00760  03 OF 06  241651Z 
300,000 MTS IN GRAINS AND BLENDED FOODS IS STRONGLY 
RECOMMENDED. NOTE: SURVEYS IN THE AMHARA, OROMIA AND SOMALI 
REGIONS PRESENTLY RECORD GLOBAL ACUTE MALNUTRITION OF AROUND 
15 PERCENT, WHICH IS IN THE CRISIS RANGE BY INTERNATIONAL 
STANDARDS. END NOTE. A WOMAN AT A FOOD DISTRIBUTION SITE 
TOLD AMBASSADOR HALL: "I LEAVE THE HOUSE EARLY EVERY MORNING 
BECAUSE I CAN'T FACE MY CHILDREN WITH THE TRUTH THAT WE HAVE 
BARELY ENOUGH FOOD TO EAT ONCE A DAY." NOTE: THE HEIGHT OF 
THE "HUNGER SEASON" WILL OCCUR IN THE APRIL THROUGH JUNE 
PERIOD. END NOTE. (GIVEN THE SCARCITY OF GRAINS, THE RATION 
PER PERSON HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM THE NUTRITIONALLY 
RECOMMENDED 15 KILOGRAMS PER PERSON PER MONTH TO 12.5 
KILOGRAMS.) 
 
¶13. GREATER LEADERSHIP AND INVOLVEMENT OF THE UNITED NATIONS

THE PRESENT DROUGHT IN BOTH ETHIOPIA AND ERITREA; 
-PRIORITIZE ASSISTANCE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONWIDE 
NUTRITION SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM AND ASSIST THE GFDRE IN THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE NUTRITION POLICY; 
-PURSUE MORE VIGOROUSLY PROGRAMS THAT DELIVERS A COMBINATION 
OF SERVICES (FOOD SUPPLEMENTS, MICRO-NUTRIENTS, HEALTH 
INPUTS, IMMUNIZATIONS, ETC.) TARGETED TO THE MOST 
NUTRITIONALLY DISADVANTAGED GROUPS IN THE POPULATION (E.G., 
INFANTS AND PREGNANT WOMEN); 
-QUICKLY INTENSIFY AND EXPAND ACTIVITIES TO STRENGTHEN 
HIV/AIDS SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS, CARE FOR ORPHANS, AND 
TRAINING FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BETTER MANAGE

AND NUTRITION EDUCATION MESSAGES. IN PARTICULAR, FEEDING 
SITES COULD SERVE AS FOCAL POINTS FOR IMMUNIZATIONS AGAINST 
MEASLES AND OTHER CONTAGIOUS DISEASES SUCH AS TYPHUS, 
RELAPSING FEVER, MENINGITIS. 
 
NOTE: THE TEAM REPEATEDLY HEARD THAT IN THIS EMERGENCY, 
EXCEPTING WFP, THE REST OF THE UN ORGANIZATIONS IN ETHIOPIA 
ARE "NOT EVEN ON THE RADAR SCREEN." AA/DCHA WINTER COMMENTED 
THAT TO DATE "HE HAD NOT RECEIVED A SINGLE CALL FROM ANYONE 
IN THE UN-SYSTEM ON THE PRESENT ETHIOPIA CRISIS." AMBASSADOR 
HALL, WHEN WE MET WITH THE UN COUNTRY TEAM ON THE FINAL DAY 
OF OUR TRIP, REMINDED THEM THAT: "THE HARVEST IS PLENTIFUL 
BUT THE WORKERS ARE FEW." END NOTE. 
 
¶14. THE GFDRE, DONORS AND THE UN NEED TO REASSESS THE SIZE 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY FOOD SECURITY (EFSR) RESERVE 
(PRESENTLY 407,000 MTS). GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF RECENT 
DISASTERS, A RESERVE OF 650,000-750,000 MTS WOULD SEEM MORE 
APPROPRIATE. A LARGER RESERVE COULD ALSO SERVE AS A PRICE- 
STABILIZATION MECHANISM IN GOOD YEARS. NOTE: EVEN IN NON- 
DROUGHT YEARS, ABOUT 5 MILLION PEOPLE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE 
MONEY TO BUY FOOD. END NOTE. SPECIFICALLY, WFP IS ENCOURAGED 
TO UTILIZE THE INTERNATIONAL FOOD POLICY RESEARCH INSTITUTE 
(IFPRI), A PART OF THE CGIAR-NETWORK, TO CONDUCT A STUDY OF 
THE HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF LOCAL GRAIN PURCHASES BY DONORS 
WITHIN ETHIOPIA. 
 
¶15. ETHIOPIA CONTRIBUTED 100,000 MTS IN EMERGENCY FOOD 
ASSISTANCE TO THE EFSR FROM THEIR BUDGET IN 2000 AND 45,000 
MTS IN 2002. GFDRE SHOULD BE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO MATCH

AGRICULTURAL ATTACHE. NOTE: A TITLE I CONTRIBUTION COULD BE 
"EARMARKED" BY THE GFDRE FOR THE EFSR AS WAS DONE WITH 
USAID/TITLE III FOOD ASSISTANCE IN 1999. END NOTE. IN THE 
LONGER-TERM, GFDRE AND DONORS NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 
ETHIOPIA'S STRUCTURAL FOOD DEFICIT (APPROXIMATELY 700,000 
MTS/ANNUM) AND FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE NATIONAL CAPACITY TO 
IMPORT FOOD ON TIME TO WHERE IT IS NEEDED AND DIRECTLY 
ADDRESS THIS DEFICIT IN ITS DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES. 
MOREOVER, THE DPPC COMMISSIONER PROMISED A LETTER REQUESTING 
USDA TO SUPPLY 10,000 MTS OF SECTION 416(B) MILK POWDER FOR 
THE PRESENT EMERGENCY.

THREAT OF FAMINE." 
 
SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SHORT-TERM AIRLIFT 
OPERATION USING MILITARY ASSETS SHOULD ALSO BE EXPLORED. 
MOREOVER, USAID/OTHER DONORS SHOULD CONSIDER PROVISION (VIA 
AIRLIFT) OF BOTH F-75 AND F-100 FOR THERAPEUTIC FEEDING. 
UNICEF IS ENCOURAGED TO IMMEDIATELY INCREASE ITS CURRENT 
AVAILABILITY OF THESE SUPPLEMENTS AND TO BUILD UP A 
CONTINGENCY STOCK. 
 
¶18. CONTINGENCY PLANNING EFFORTS SHOULD BE EXPLORED IN CASE 
THE THROUGHPUT OF THE PORT OF DJIBOUTI IS REDUCED BECAUSE OF 
SECURITY ISSUES OR CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS (THE LATTER IS NOT 
ENVISAGED WITH THE CURRENT DELIVERY SCHEDULE).  A TRIAL 
SHIPMENT OF SOME 5,000 TO 10,000 MT OF CEREALS SHOULD BE 
DISPATCHED THROUGH PORT SUDAN.

¶19. USAID/WASHINGTON SHOULD EXTEND THE DURATION OF THE OFDA 
ASSESSMENT TEAM IN COUNTRY AND CONSIDER THE EXPANSION OF 
OFDA NON-FOOD SUPPORT COVERAGE, PRESENTLY ASSISTING 500,000 
VULNERABLE PEOPLE. FURTHER, USAID SHOULD PROVIDE (IF 
FEASIBLE) OFDA GRANT AUTHORITY IN COUNTRY TO BETTER ENSURE 
RAPID RESPONSE TO NON-FOOD REQUIREMENTS AND COUNTER-FAMINE 
MEASURES/INITIATIVES. 
 
¶20. USAID ETHIOPIA IS TO BE LAUDED FOR REPROGRAMMING U.S. 17 
MILLION DOLLARS IN UNUSED NON-PROJECT (NPA) ASSISTANCE FROM 
PRIOR YEARS FOR USE IN HEALTH AND NUTRITION INVENTIONS 
RELATED TO THE PRESENT CRISIS. USAID IS ENCOURAGED TO 
"SCRUB" FURTHER ITS IN-COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO TO 
ENSURE THAT ALL POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM "RESIDUES" HAVE 
BEEN IDENTIFIED. 
 
¶21. US MISSION/ROME WILL DEEPEN DIALOGUE WITH FAO RELATED TO 
INTENSIFICATION OF FAO EFFORTS IN ETHIOPIA ON ITS 
ACKNOWLEDGED AREAS OF "COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE" (SOIL AND 
WATER CONSERVATION, SPS CAPACITY BUILDING, REFORESTATION, 
TRANSBOUNDRY PESTS, GLOBAL EARLY WARNING, RIFT VALLEY FEVER 
CONTROL, ETC.). 
 
¶22. GFDRE AND DONORS SHOULD FOCUS PRIORITY ATTENTION IN THE 
MEDIUM AND LONGER-TERM TO THE 156 ALREADY IDENTIFIED MOST 
DROUGHT-PRONE WOREDAS IN THE FOUR LARGEST GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS 
AND ASK GFDRE TO SIMILARLY PRIORITIZE THE MOST VULNERABLE 
WOREDAS IN SOMALI AND AFAR REGIONS. 
 
¶23. THERE APPEARS TO BE A LOSS OF INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY AMONG 
SOME DONORS AND IN CERTAIN DONOR CAPITALS OF JUST HOW

PAGE 04        ROME  00760  05 OF 06  241651Z 
MASSIVE AND DEVASTATING WAS THE 1984-85 FAMINE. HIGH-PROFILE 
CRISES ELSEWHERE HAVE KEPT ETHIOPIA OFF THE TELEVISION 
SCREENS. AMBASSADOR HALL MET BY CHANCE WITH ONE DONOR WHO 
(WHILE ADMITTING BEING UNABLE TO TRAVEL BEYOND ADDIS ABABA) 
ASSURED THAT "THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION IS 
UNDOUBTEDLY EXAGGERATED" AND "THE MATTER IS WELL IN HAND." 
HEREIN LIES THE PROBLEM. WE ALL NEED TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS 
TO BROADCAST THE NEED FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION TO AVERT IMMINENT 
TRAGEDY. THE MEDIA NEEDS TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVELY ENGAGED. AS 
PER THE U.S. CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC) (PRESENTLY 
ASSESSING THE NUTRITIONAL AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASE STATUS IN 
FOUR ETHIOPIAN GEOGRAPHIC ZONES), THEY ESTIMATE (FEBRUARY- 
JUNE 2003) 32,000 EXCESS DEATHS DUE TO DROUGHT WILL OCCUR IN 
THE REVIEWED AREAS. IF THIS TREND IS PROJECTED NATIONALLY, 
(AND FACTORING IN THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO E.G., SUB-STANDARD 
BELG RAINS), EXCESS DEATHS COULD REACH AS HIGH AS 300,000 TO 
500,000 PEOPLE BY THE END OF 2003. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT 
ACCEPTABLE.

A PERSONAL NOTE FROM AMBASSADOR HALL 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶24. MY HEARTFELT GRATITUDE AND THANKS TO AMBASSADOR BRAZEAL 
AND STAFF FOR BRINGING TO FRUITION (ON FEBRUARY 20) A 
MONUMENT ON EMBASSY GROUNDS HONORING U.S. CONGRESSMAN MICKEY 
LELAND AND USAID/STATE DEPARTMENT STAFF, BOTH AMERICAN AND 
ETHIOPIAN - WHO TRAGICALLY DIED ON A HUMANITARIAN MISSION TO 
A REMOTE AREA OF WESTERN ETHIOPIA ON AUGUST 7, 1989. BOTH 
MICKEY AND I SERVED TOGETHER FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS ON THE 
HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON HUNGER WHERE HE WORKED TIRELESSLY 
TO MAKE OTHER LIVES BETTER. AND WHILE MICKEY TRAVELED ALL 
OVER THE WORLD TO ASSIST THE HUNGRY POOR, HE HAD A SPECIAL 
LOVE FOR ETHIOPIA. HE REMAINS FOR ME (AND FOR ALL WHO KNEW 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  00760  06 OF 06  241652Z 
HIM) A LIVING EXAMPLE OF THE DEEP COMPASSION AND GENEROSITY 
OF AMERICA. 
 
¶25. AS AA/DCHA WINTER WENT ON DIRECTLY TO SUDAN, HE DID NOT 
HAVE A CHANCE TO CLEAR THIS CABLE.   HALL
