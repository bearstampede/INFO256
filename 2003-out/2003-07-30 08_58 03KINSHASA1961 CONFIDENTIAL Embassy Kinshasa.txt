¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  On 25 July, GDRC President Joseph Kabila 
named eminence grise Augustin Katumba Mwanke 
Secretary-General of the DRC's transitional government. 
Kabila officially suspended Katumba in October 2002 following 
publication of the UN panel report on illegal exploitation of 
the DRC's wealth; however, Katumba's influence continued 
unabated.  The role of the Secretary-General is unclear, and 
will doubtless be a subject of debate between ex-rebel 
movements and members of Kabila's camp.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
A Suspension in Name Only 
------------------------- 
¶2. (C) On 25 July, GDRC President Joseph Kabila named 
Augustin Katumba Mwanke as Secretary-General of the 
transitional government.  Considered a hardliner, Katumba is 
a longtime Kabila associate and former governor of Katanga 
province.  He served as Minister of the Presidency until 
October 2002, when Kabila suspended him and several other 
members of the GDRC's ruling elite who were cited in a report 
by the U.N. Panel on Illegal Exploitation of Natural 
Resources and Other Forms of Wealth. 
 
¶3. (C) Despite the suspension, Katumba continued to play a 
major role, exerting influence personally as well as through 
allies such as Guillaume Samba Kaputo, Kabila's deputy chief 
of staff.  He was intimately involved with the 
Inter-Congolese Dialogue political negotiations until their 
conclusion in December 2002 and has a hand in the ongoing 
negotiations on military-security integration.  In the months 
leading up to the formation of the DRC's transitional 
government, it was rumored that he was bucking to replace 
Jean Mbuyu as Kabila's Special Adviser on security matters. 
 
 
What Responsibilities? 
---------------------- 
¶4. (C) The transitional constitution is azy on the 
Secretary-General's role and responsibilities.  It merely 
says that he "...assists the resident and Vice-Presidents in 
coordinating govrnmental action" by "preparing meetings, 
works ad all dossiers requiring the concerted attention o 
the President and Vice-Presidents and at the cabinet level." 
(Note:  Informal poloff translation. End note.)  According 
to Kabila's 25 July decre, four Executive Secretaries will 
assist Katumba one per vice-presidential "commission."  The 
for are: 
 
--Political, Defense and Security Commission - Shadrac 
Baitsura Musowa of the RCD-Goma.  H is a Nande from South 
Kivu, has a background inintelligence work, reportedly an 
associate of Biima Karaha. 
 
--Economic and Financial Commission- Tshimanga Mwadi of the 
MLC.  (Details unknown.) 
 
--Reconstruction and Development Commission - Jlien Bukasa 
Kashama of the Kinshasa government. A Luba from Eastern 
Kasai, former career civil srvant in Ministry of Finance and 
Budget. 
 
--Soial and Cultural Commission - Egide Ngokoso of the 
political opposition.  From Bandundu, a leader inAndre 
Boboliko's PDSC political party. 
 
 
Reacton to Katumba's Return 
--------------------------- 
¶5. (C) RCD-Goma official Jean-Marie Emungu wa circumspect in 
a 28 July telcon with poloff, sayng only that the RCD-Goma 
had "taken note" of the announcement.  MLC official Thomas 
Luhaka told poloff on 29 July that it is better to have 
Katumba in an official position, where he will face public 
scrutiny.  The Secretary-General's role should be strictly 
administrative; however, undoubtedly Katumba and his allies 
will seek to expand it. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶6. (C) Having Katumba down amongst the vice-presidents will 
help Kabila maintain his image of being above the fray, and 
at the same time answers the question of where Katumba will 
fit into the new system.  There will likely be a struggle 
over his exact role, with VP's Azarias Ruberwa of the 
RCD-Goma and Jean-Pierre Bemba of the MLC seeking to limit 
Katumba's powers.  The International Committee to Support the 
Transition (CIAT) may be drawn into the debate, as CIAT 
members will need to decide whether they will want to deal 
with the transitional government through Katumba or interact 
directly with the four vice-presidents.  END COMMENT.
