SUBJECT: IRAQI FINANCIAL DEBT TO ITALY 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (SBU) DESPITE ITALIAN MEDIA CLAIMS THAT IRAQI DEBT 
TO ITALY IS E7 BILLION, GOI OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD US THAT 
THE AMOUNT IS CLOSER TO E1.3 BILLION.  MOST OF THE DEBT 
RELATES TO A MID-1980S IRAQI ORDER OF FOUR FRIGATES, 
WHICH WERE NEVER DELIVERED BECAUSE OF A SUBSEQUENT UN 
EMBARGO.  THE GOI ASSUMED THE COST OF THESE FRIGATES. 
WHILE NO OFFICIAL DECISION HAS BEEN MADE, GOI OFFICIALS 
INDICATE THAT THIS DEBT WILL LIKELY BE FORGIVEN WHEN A 
NEW IRAQI GOVERNMENT IS IN PLACE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) IN A MARCH 20TH ARTICLE, THE ITALIAN FINANCIAL 
DAILY MF CLAIMED THAT IRAQI DEBT TO ITALY TOTALED E7 
BILLION, A CLAIM AND FIGURE THAT WERE PICKED UP BY MOST 
MAJOR ITALIAN NEWSPAPERS. THE MF JOURNALIST APPARENTLY 
LUMPED TOGETHER TWO OUTSTANDING DEBTS  ONE RELATING TO 
THE ORDER OF FOUR WARSHIPS, THE SECOND TO THE VALUE OF 
A FUND ILLEGALLY GRANTED TO IRAQ BY A MAJOR ITALIAN 
BANK, BANCA NAZIONALE DEL LAVORO (BNL).  REGARDING THE 
LATTER, THE ATLANTA OFFICE OF BNL ISSUED A FUND VALUED 
AT E2.6 BILLION FOR THE FINANCING OF ARMS PURCHASES TO 
IRAQ IN 1986. U.S. COURTS RULED THE FUND ISSUANCE WAS 
ILLEGAL. ITALY ALSO RULED THAT THE CREDIT WAS ILLEGAL 
SINCE AT THAT TIME, ITALY HAD PLACED AN EMBARGO ON IRAQ 
UNTIL OUTSTANDING DEBT FOR THE FOUR FRIGATES WAS PAID. 
IRAQ NEVER RE-PAID THE FUND.  BNL WROTE OFF THIS DEBT 
    MANY YEARS AGO (1993-1995). 
 
¶3. (SBU) THE MORE SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF IRAQ DEBT 
RELATES TO FOUR LUPO FRIGATES (SMALL WARSHIPS) 
S) 
ORDERED BY IRAQ IN 1981 BUT NEVER DELIVERED BECAUSE OF 
IRAN/IRAQ WAR FIRST AND THE UN EMBARGO LATER.  THE 
FRIGATES REACHED ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT AND TUNIS, BUT NEVER 
REACHED THE IRAQI PORT OF UM QASR. IRAQ REFUSED TO PAY 
FOR THE FRIGATES.  AS A RESULT OF THIS DISPUTE, 
FINCANTIERI (THE GOI-CONTROLLED SHIPYARD COMPANY THAT 
BUILT THE FRIGATES) SUFFERED A NET LOSS OF TWO TRILLION 
LIRE  (APPROXIMATELY USD 1.5 BILLION).  THE COST OF 
MAINTAINING THE FOUR FRIGATES IN THE ITALIAN PORT OF LA 
SPEZIA FROM 1986-1991 REACHED 660 MILLION LIRE 
(APPROXIMATELY USD 500,000), WHICH WAS BORNE BY THE 
GOI.  IN 1991, THE SIX WARSHIPS WERE SOLD TO THE 
ITALIAN NAVY, WHICH MEANT AN ADDITIONAL BUDGETARY 
BURDEN. 
 
¶4. (SBU) THE IRAQ GOVERNMENT ALSO WAS SUPPOSED TO PAY 
ONE TRILLION LIRE (APPROX. USD 770 MILL) TO COMPANIES 
(SUCH AS OTOMELARA, AGUSTA, BREDA MECCANICA, AND 
IDICIMA) THAT PROVIDED WEAPONS AND SOPHISTICATED 
TELECOM EQUIPMENT ON THE FRIGATES.  THE OVERALL LOSS 
WOULD BE ESTIMATED AT ABOUT 5 TRILLION IN 1986 LIRE 
(APPROXIMATELY USD 3.3 BILLION) OR ABOUT E4.5 BILLION 
IN TODAYS TERMS.  THIS COMBINED WITH THE E2.6 BILLION 
BNL CREDIT TO IRAQ WOULD CORRESPOND TO AN OVERALL DEBT 
POSITION OF E7 BILLION, THE FIGURE CLAIMED BY THE 
FINANCIAL PAPER MF. 

¶5. (SBU) GOI OFFICIALS ARGUE THAT THE E7 BILLION FIGURE 
IS ERRONEOUS.  CARLO GUARINONI, HEAD OF STUDIES AND 
ECONOMIC RESEARCH OF SACE (ITALIAN FOREIGN TRADE 
INSURANCE SERVICES AGENCY) TOLD US THAT IRAQS OFFICIAL 
IRAQI DEBT POSITION TO ITALY IS 1.4 BILLION EURO (USD 
1.35 BILLION DOLLARS).  FILIPPO GIANSANTE, DIRECTOR OF 
INTERNATIONAL DEBT AT THE FINANCE MINISTRY CORROBORATED 
THIS OFFICIAL FIGURE. GUARINONI TOLD US THAT ITALY, AS 
A SIGN OF GOOD WILL WITH A NEW IRAQI ADMINISTRATION, 
WOULD LIKELY FORGIVE THE OUTSTANDING DEBT RELATED TO 
THE FRIGATES.
