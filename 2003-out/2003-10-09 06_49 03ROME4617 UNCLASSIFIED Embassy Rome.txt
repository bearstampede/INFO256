DELEGATION TO THE EU-U.S. CIVIL AVIATION NEGOTIATIONS,

IN CONTROL OF IMPLEMENTING THE EU'S AIRPORT NOISE DIRECTIVE 
DESCRIBED IN REFTELS.

MEETING, IN WHICH ANY REMAINING DOUBT ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE 
MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT WAS ERASED.  THE ROLES DESCRIBED 
IN REFTEL (A) ARE REVERSED - THE MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT 
IS NOW REDUCED TO AN ADVISORY ROLE, WITH THE MINISTRY OF 
TRANSPORTATION ASSUMING PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
IMPLEMENTING THE AIRPORT NOISE DECREE. 
 
¶3. COMMENT: THIS SHIFT IN IMPLEMENTATION RESPONSIBILITY IS 
GOOD NEWS FOR U.S. CARGO AIR TRAFFIC TO ITALY.  SANSONE 
EXPLAINED THAT A BAN ON NIGHT FLIGHTS IN ITALY HAD BEEN A 
POSSIBILITY WHEN THE ISSUE WAS STILL UNDER THE MINISTRY OF 
THE ENVIRONMENT.  SANSONE AND THE VISITING FAA DIRECTOR 
AGREED THAT THIS ISSUE WAS BEST MANAGED BY THE MINISTRY OF 
TRANSPORTATION, SINCE "IT KNOWS AVIATION" AND CAN GRASP THE 
    IMPLICATIONS OF ANY SUCH REGULATORY STEP UPON THE INDUSTRY AT 
LARGE.  END COMMENT.
