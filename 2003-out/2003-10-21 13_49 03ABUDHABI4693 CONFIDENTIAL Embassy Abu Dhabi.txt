SUBJECT:  UAEG AND THE MADRID DONORS CONFERENCE 
 
 Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, Reasons 
 1.5(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) UAE Deputy Prime Minister and MinState 
for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al- 
Nahyan (HBZ) told the Ambassador October 19 that 
his country will reveal its pledge for Iraq 
reconstruction in Madrid.  Shaykh Hamdan said 
that the UAEG has spent over $70 million to date 
on Iraq, and that figure is expected to rise to 
$100 million by the end of this year.  HBZ said 
that the package will include considerable 
assistance in kind, and he cited power 
generation equipment the Iraqis have requested 
as an example.  Meanwhile, he said, the UAEG is 
consulting with all GCC countries regarding 
their pledges, though he added that the Qataris 
are not participating in the Donors Conference. 
 
¶2. (C) Shaykh Hamdan said that the UAEG is working 
closely with the Germans on Iraq and wants to bring 
them, as well as the French, into the process of 
reconstruction, believing their involvement is 
important.  HBZ was closely following the pledging 
plans of other countries and asked us for any 
further detail we could provide.  He and the 
Ambassador compared notes on several major donors. 
 
¶3. (C) Shaykh Hamdan told the Ambassador that Vice 
President Cheney's call to Abu Dhabi Crown Prince 
Shaykh Khalifa on October 16 regarding Iraq 
reconstruction went well, and that the Vice 
President had reiterated his invitation to Shaykh 
Khalifa to visit the United States.  The Ambassador 
noted that if the visit takes place this year, it 
needs to be sooner rather than later because of the 
2004 U.S. presidential campaign season.  Shaykh 
Hamdan told the Ambassador that a letter from 
Shaykh Zayed responding to the POTUS letter on Iraq 
would be forwarded to the Embassy in the next few 
days.
