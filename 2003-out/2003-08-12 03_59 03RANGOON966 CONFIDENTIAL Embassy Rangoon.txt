¶1. (C) We received a letter dated July 29, addressed to 
President Bush and signed by sixteen rank and file Rangoon 
Division members of the National League for Democracy (NLD). 
A translation of the letter and a copy of the original has 
been pouched to EAP/BCLTV. 
 
¶2. (C) The letter offered thanks to the President, the 
Congress, and the Senate for "keeping a conscientious watch 
over the democratic forces of Burma..." and expressed 
wholehearted support for the Burmese Freedom and Democracy 
Act and the Executive Order.  The letter also promised that 
the signatories would "join hands in democratic activities 
not only for Burma, but also for the world." 
 
¶3. (C) This seemingly independent and brave move by local NLD 
members to show their support for the sanctions reflects the 
general support for sanctions expressed to us by most average 
Burmese.  Most educated Burmese, not involved in business, 
with whom we spoke have agreed that this government cannot 
understand anything but pressure, and that a certain amount 
of pain is acceptable in the pursuit of democratic change. 
Even businesspeople facing the full brunt of economic 
sanctions privately accede that the SPDC is fully to blame 
for the country's economic and political mess and they can 
understand the U.S. policy to take strong action.  The 
beleaguered merchants add, though, that they sincerely hope 
the U.S. policy objectives can soon be attained before too 
much damage is done to the economy and Burmese workers.
