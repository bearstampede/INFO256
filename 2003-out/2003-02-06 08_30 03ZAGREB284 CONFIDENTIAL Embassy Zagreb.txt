SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) FROM FEBRUARY 3-5, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE MIRA RICARDEL LED A TEAM OF U.S. POLICY MAKERS FROM 
OSD, THE JOINT STAFF, MINNESOTA NATIONAL GUARD AND US 
EUROPEAN COMMAND IN BILATERAL DEFENSE CONSULTATIONS WITH 
CROATIA.  IN MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT MESIC, PRIME MINISTER 
RACAN, DEFENSE MINISTER ANTUNOVIC AND CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF 
LUCIC, RICARDEL URGED FURTHER PROGRESS ON DEFENSE REFORM AND 
PRESSED FOR RESOLUTION OF LEGAL ISSUES OBSTRUCTING CLOSER 
U.S.-CROATIAN MILITARY COOPERATION.  RICARDEL PRAISED 
CROATIA'S COMMITMENT AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GLOBAL WAR ON 
TERRORISM AND URGED GOC LEADERS TO PRESS FORWARD ON 
PRIORITIES RAISED DURING THE RECENT REVIEW OF CROATIA'S FIRST 
ANNUAL NATIONAL PROGRAM UNDER NATO'S MAP PROGRAM.  ON 
FEBRUARY 4, DASD RICARDEL AND DEFMIN ANTUNOVIC SIGNED AN 
AGREEMENT TO HELP CROATIA DEVELOP ITS CAPABILITY TO COMBAT 
PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. 
 
¶2.  (C) PM RACAN EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR U.S. ASSISTANCE 
TO TIGHTEN CONTROL OVER CROATIA'S BORDERS AND TO COMBAT WMD 
PROLIFERATION.  HE DESCRIBED THE KEY REFORMS HIS GOVERNMENT 
HAS IMPLEMENTED SINCE IT CAME TO POWER IN 2000, MOST OF WHICH 
HAVE COME AT A HIGH PRICE, BUT ALL OF WHICH MAKE CROATIA A 
LEADING CANDIDATE FOR INTEGRATION INTO EURO-ATLANTIC 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00284  01 OF 05  060851Z 
INSTITUTIONS.  BOTH RACAN AND DEFMIN ANTUNOVIC ASSERTED THAT 
THE CABINET WILL PASS A MEASURE ON FEBRUARY 6 WHICH WILL 
ALLOW USN SHIPS VISITING CROATIAN PORTS TO IMPLEMENT 
NECESSARY FORCE PROTECTION PRACTICES, WHICH SHOULD CLEAR THE 
WAY FOR U.S. SHIP VISITS TO RESUME. 
 
¶3.  (C) CROATIA IS SERIOUS ABOUT ITS NATO ASPIRATIONS AND HAS 
BECOME A NET CONTRIBUTOR TO SECURITY IN THE REGION.  BUT 
CROATIA'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP MUST FIRST IDENTIFY AS A 
NATIONAL PRIORITY AND THEN ALLOCATE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES 
TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES NEEDED IN THE DEFENSE 
MINISTRY AND THE CROATIAN ARMED FORCES.  IT MUST ALSO BEGIN 
TO ADDRESS THE SERIOUS POLITICAL AND SOCIETAL ISSUES 
ADDRESSED IN ITS RECENT NATO REVIEW.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶4.  (C) FROM FEBRUARY 3-5 DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE MIRA RICARDEL VISITED ZAGREB FOR THE FIRST FORMAL 
BILATERAL DEFENSE CONSULTATIONS (BDC) WITH THE CROATIAN 
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE.  WITH DASD RICARDEL WERE GENERAL EUGENE 
ANDREOTTI, ADJUTANT GENERAL OF THE MINNESOTA NATIONAL GUARD 
(CROATIA'S STATE PARTNER), REAR ADMIRAL RICHARD JASKOT OF US 
EUROPEAN COMMAND'S J5, AND ALAN VAN EGMOND, DOD'S DIRECTOR OF 
WESTERN EURASIA AND BALKANS AFFAIRS.  DASD RICARDEL MET 
SEPARATELY WITH PRESIDENT STIPE MESIC, PRIME MINISTER IVICA 
RACAN, DEFENSE MINISTER ZELJKA ANTUNOVIC AND WITH THE NEWLY 
APPOINTED CHIEF OF CROATIA'S GENERAL STAFF, JOSIP LUCIC. 
THREE BDC WORKING GROUPS DISCUSSED INTEROPERABILITY WITH 
NATO, DEFENSE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION, AND BORDER SECURITY 
AND COUNTER - PROLIFERATION.

BILATERAL DEFENSE CONSULTATIONS 
=============================== 
 
¶5.  (C) THE FORMAL STRUCTURE OF THE BDC CONSISTED OF AN 
OPENING PLENARY SESSION FOLLOWED BY THREE WORKING GROUP 
MEETINGS TO FOCUS ON KEY ISSUES OF BILATERAL CONCERN.  IN HER 
OPENING STATEMENT, DASD RICARDEL RECOGNIZED CROATIA'S 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WAR ON TERRORISM, HIGHLIGHTING THE 
INTERDICTION OF THE M/V BOKA STAR, THE CONTRIBUTION OF 
WEAPONS AND MUNITIONS TO THE AFGHAN NATIONAL ARMY AND THE 
IMMINENT DEPLOYMENT OF A MILITARY POLICE PLATOON TO 
AFGHANISTAN IN SUPPORT OF ISAF.  EUCOM'S RADM JASKOT GAVE A 
BRIEFING ON THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM, HIGHLIGHTING THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY PARTNERS.  DASD RICARDEL FOLLOWED WITH 
A HARD-HITTING PRESENTATION ON THE CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGERS 
PRESENTED BY THE PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION, PARTICULARLY THE NEXUS BETWEEN TERRORIST GROUPS, 
STATES WHICH SPONSOR TERRORISM AND WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION. 
 
¶6.  (C) CROATIAN PRESENTATIONS TO THE PLENARY SESSION COVERED 
CROATIA'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE WAR ON TERRORISM AND TO OTHER 
PEACE SUPPORT OPERATIONS.  DASD RICARDEL WELCOMED CROATIA'S 
EAGERNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN SO MANY OPERATIONS, BUT 
QUESTIONED IF CROATIA HAS A FISCAL PLAN OR HAS IDENTIFIED 
SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO CONDUCT SUCH OPERATIONS.  ASSISTANT

DEFMIN JELENA GRCIC POLIC, NOTING AN INTERAGENCY PAPER IN 
PROGRESS, RESPONDED THAT THE ISAF DEPLOYMENT WILL BE THE 
FIRST INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY WHICH THE MOD'S BUDGET WILL NOT 
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ABSORBING; THE CABINET TOOK A DECISION TO 
FINANCE THIS ACTIVITY WITH A SEPARATE LINE ITEM.  THE MOD 
HOPES TO REPLICATE THIS PRACTICE FOR OTHER PEACE SUPPORT 
OPERATIONS AND FOR FUNDING DEFENSE REFORMS LIKE DOWNSIZING, 
WHICH ARE FAR BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE MOD'S BUDGET. 
 
WORKING GROUPS PRODUCE CONCRETE RESULTS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) THE THREE WORKING GROUPS DISCUSSED THE BROAD RANGE OF 
ISSUES RELATING TO U.S. - CROATIA BILATERAL DEFENSE 
RELATIONS.  FOLLOWING SUBSTANTIVE PRESENTATIONS OF CROATIA'S 
REFORM PLANS, U.S. PARTICIPANTS PROPOSED SEVERAL CONCRETE 
AREAS WHERE USG EXPERIENCE AND ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS MIGHT BE 
ABLE TO HELP ACHIEVE MOD GOALS.  WORKING GROUPS REVIEWED 
CROATIA'S PROGRESS IN NATO'S MAP PROGRAM, DISCUSSED THE USE 
OF U.S. ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT CROATIA'S DEFENSE REFORM, 
MODERNIZATION AND TRAINING GOALS, AND BORDER SECURITY AND 
COUNTER-PROLIFERATION.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE WORKING 
GROUPS AGREED: 
 
- TO FORM AN INFORMAL BILATERAL LEGAL WORKING GROUP BETWEEN 
EUCOM AND CROATIAN MOD EXPERTS (AUGMENTED AS NECESSARY) TO 
MOVE QUICKLY TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING IMPEDIMENTS TO MILITARY 
COOPERATION, AND 
 
- THAT THE GOC WOULD FORM A JOINT CIVILIAN-MILITARY 
INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP TO ADDRESS EXPORT CONTROL AND 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00284  02 OF 05  060851Z 
BORDER SECURITY ISSUES.  THIS GROUP WILL SERVE AS THE GOC'S 
INTERFACE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND WOULD HELP 
COORDINATE AND DIRECT ASSISTANCE EFFORTS. 
 
¶8.  (U)  THE BDC CONCLUDED BY DECIDING TO MEET AGAIN IN A 
YEAR'S TIME WITH THE U.S. HOSTING. 
 
================== 
BILATERAL MEETINGS 
================== 
 
PM RACAN: PROGRESS TOWARD NATO AND EU MEMBERSHIP 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶9.  (C) IN A MEETING WITH DASD RICARDEL AND THE AMBASSADOR, 
PM RACAN DESCRIBED IN DETAIL HOW CROATIA'S PROGRESS ON 
REFORMS  MAKES IT A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR INTEGRATION INTO 
EURO-ATLANTIC INSTITUTIONS.  DESPITE THE INTRA-COALITION 
BRINKSMANSHIP THAT SO OFTEN CROWDS THE HEADLINES, RACAN SAID 
HIS GOVERNMENT IS STABLE AND WILL SERVE OUT ITS FULL TERM. 
COMMITMENT TO ECONOMIC REFORM HAS PRODUCED DURABLE RESULTS, 
THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATION IS STABLE, GDP GROWTH IS EXPECTED 
TO REACH 5 PERCENT THIS YEAR, AND UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN 
DECREASING FOR THE PAST TEN MONTHS.  RACAN STATED THAT HIS 
GOVERNMENT WILL NOT SLACK OFF THE PACE OF REFORMS IN ITS LAST 
YEAR, AND PLEDGED HIS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD 
WITH REFORMS IN THE MILITARY. 
 
¶10.  (C) ACCORDING TO RACAN, CROATIA IS SUCCESSFULLY 
ADDRESSING THE POLITICAL CONDITIONS OF NATO AND THE EU.  HE 
CLAIMED CROATIA SHOULD HAVE "SOLVED" THE PROBLEM OF MINORITY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00284  02 OF 05  060851Z 
RIGHTS WITH PASSAGE OF A PROGRESSIVE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON 
NATIONAL MINORITIES, BUT ADMITTED THAT IMPLEMENTATION IS 
INCOMPLETE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.  RACAN DEFENDED GOC ACTION ON 
REFUGEE RETURN; CROATIA'S POST-WAR "ETHNIC MOSAIC" WILL NEVER 
BE THE SAME AS IT WAS BEFORE 1991, BUT THE GOC IS COMMITTED 
TO SUPPORTING THE RETURN OF ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO COME BACK. 
FULLY 100,000 HAVE ALREADY RETURNED SINCE 2000, HE EXPECTS 
ANOTHER 20,000 WILL SEEK TO RETURN IN 2003.  THE GOC HAS 
COMMITTED 300 MILLION EUROS IN ITS 2003 BUDGET TO 
RECONSTRUCTION AND RETURN; ALL THOSE WHO FORMALLY EXPRESSED A 
DESIRE TO RETURN TO CROATIA BY THE END OF 2002 WILL BE 
ACCOMMODATED BY THE END OF 2003, RACAN CLAIMED. 
 
¶11.  (C) RACAN TOUTED CROATIA'S STRONG RECORD OF REGIONAL 
COOPERATION AND SAID THE GOC WAS STRONGLY INCLINED TO LIFT 
ITS VISA REQUIREMENT FOR CITIZENS OF YUGOSLAVIA, THOUGH THIS 
WAS POLITICALLY QUITE SENSITIVE.  HE REMARKED THAT SUCH 
CROATIAN LIBERALIZATION WOULD, IRONICALLY, COME JUST AS 
HUNGARY IMPOSES A VISA REQUIREMENT ON THE FRY. 
 
¶12.  (C) ON CROATIA'S RELATIONS WITH ICTY, RACAN ASSERTED 
THAT CROATIA IS IN FULL COMPLIANCE AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S 
COMMITMENT TO CLOSE COOPERATION HAS BEEN VALIDATED BY ITS 
APPROACH TO THE BOBETKO CASE.  FIRST, THE VERY PUBLIC 
DISCUSSION OF HOW LACK OF COOPERATION WITH ICTY WOULD AFFECT 
CROATIA'S CHANCES TO ENTER THE EU AND NATO HAVE SHORED UP

PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE GOC POSITION,  SECOND, THE 
OPPOSITION'S ATTEMPTS TO DESTABILIZE THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL 
SCENE FAILED, AND THIRD, CROATIA'S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULED 
THAT ICTY IS THE COURT OF JURISDICTION FOR ALL FUTURE 
APPEALS, CUTTING OFF OPPOSITION LEGAL MANEUVERS.  HE CLAIMED 
THAT ICTY IS NOW "OFF OF THE EU AGENDA," AND HIS UPCOMING 
VISIT TO THE UK WILL TAKE PLACE IN THAT CONTEXT.  RACAN ADDED 
THAT WITH THE BOBETKO CASE SOON TO REACH FINAL RESOLUTION, 
"NOW GOTOVINA HAS BECOME TOPICAL," BUT HE STRESSED THAT 
"CROATIA WILL NOT BE HELD HOSTAGE BY GENERAL GOTOVINA." 
 
¶13.  (C) AS IN ALL HER BILATERAL MEETINGS, DASD RICARDEL 
THANKED CROATIA FOR ITS SUPPORT TO AND CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE 
GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM.  WITH RACAN, SHE ALSO LAID DOWN A 
MARKER FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE REQUESTS FOR LANDING RIGHTS AND 
TRANSIT OF U.S. PERSONNEL EN ROUTE TO THE MIDDLE EAST REGION 
FOR MOVEMENT OF FORCES RELATED TO IRAQ; WHILE HE MADE NO 
COMMITMENTS, HE EXPRESSED OPTIMISM THAT SUCH REQUESTS WOULD 
BE FAVORABLY REVIEWED.  DASD RICARDEL TOLD RACAN THAT SHE HAD 
GIVEN THE BDC PLENARY SESSION A BLUNT BRIEFING ON THE THREATS 
OF PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION; THE USG 
APPRECIATES PAST GOC SUPPORT IN REFRAINING FROM SALES OF 
WEAPONS OR DUAL-USE ITEMS TO STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM AND 
URGED CONTINUED ADHERENCE TO THIS POLICY OF NOT SELLING 
WEAPONS TO LIBYA AND SIMILAR STATES. 
 
¶14.  (C) RICARDEL PRESSED RACAN TO MOVE FORWARD WITH DEFENSE 
REFORMS AND EXPRESSED UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFICULT ROAD 
AHEAD; THE U.S. WOULD CONTINUE TO ASSIST WHERE IT CAN. 
RICARDEL SAID THE U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT CROATIA'S 
RESTRUCTURING EFFORTS AS IT MAKES ITS BID FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00284  03 OF 05  060852Z 
AND URGED RACAN TO SUPPORT THE REFORMS IDENTIFIED IN THE MAP 
ANP REVIEW PROCESS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO CIVIL 
SOCIETY ISSUES LIKE REFUGEE RETURN. 
 
¶15.  (C) DASD RICARDEL TOUCHED ON THE ISSUE OF THE USG'S 
OUTSTANDING REQUEST TO SIGN AN ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT WITH 
CROATIA.  SHE EXPLAINED U.S. LEGISLATION MAKING PROVISION OF 
MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO ALL NON-NATO STATES CONTINGENT ON 
SIGNING SUCH AN AGREEMENT BY JULY 1, 2003; USG MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE IS ESSENTIAL FOR CROATIA TO ACHIEVE ITS 
MODERNIZATION AND INTEROPERABILITY GOALS.  RACAN EXPLAINED 
THAT CROATIA IS CAUGHT BETWEEN THE EU'S INSISTENCE THAT 
CANDIDATES TOE THE EU LINE AND THE USG'S INSISTENCE ON AN CIC 
EXEMPTION.  HE CONTINUES TO WAIT FOR A CLEAR SIGNAL FROM 
BRUSSELS BEFORE MOVING FORWARD.  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD RACAN 
THAT USG-EU DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE, BUT THE EU HAS ALREADY 
STATED IT DOES NOT OBJECT TO ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENTS, BUT HAS 
SIMPLY SET A LIST OF CRITERIA WHICH SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. 
STRESSING THE APPROACHING DEADLINE UNDER U.S. LEGISLATION, 
THE AMBASSADOR POINTED OUT TO RACAN THAT THE GOC EVENTUALLY 
MAY HAVE TO DECIDE BASED ON CROATIA'S GOALS AND NEEDS, NOT 
THOSE OF THE EU. 
 
PRESIDENT MESIC: CROATIA WILL CONTINUE DIFFICULT REFORMS 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶16.  (C) DASD RICARDEL THANKED PRESIDENT MESIC FOR HIS MORAL 
LEADERSHIP ON REFORM ISSUES AND FOR HIS INSISTENCE THAT 
CROATIA MUST CONTINUE TO COOPERATE WITH THE HAGUE.  SHE URGED 
THAT HE LEND HIS LEADERSHIP IN SUPPORT OF THE ISSUE OF 
DEFENSE DOWNSIZING AND RESTRUCTURING.  LIKE RACAN, MESIC 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00284  03 OF 05  060852Z 
OUTLINED THE STRONG ECONOMIC PROGRESS THE GOC CONTINUES TO 
MAKE, BUT EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION AT THE GOVERNMENT'S INABILITY 
TO GET ITS MESSAGE OUT TO THE PUBLIC.  HE PLEDGED CROATIA'S 
COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WITH NECESSARY REFORMS, BUT EXPLAINED 
THE POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT IN WHICH THE MOD 
MUST CARRY OUT DOWNSIZING EFFORTS.  MESIC HAILED THE USG 
COMMITMENT TO ASSIST CROATIA TO COMBAT THE PROLIFERATION OF 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.  DASD RICARDEL REQUESTED 
CROATIA'S CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR IRAQI COMPLIANCE WITH UN 
RESOLUTIONS NOTING THAT CROATIA EXPERIENCED FIRST-HAND THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF STATES' NON-COMPLIANCE WITH UN RESOLUTIONS. 
 
CHOD LUCIC:  U.S. COOPERATION ALREADY BEARS RESULTS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶17.  (C) DASD RICARDEL CONGRATULATED CHIEF OF CROATIA'S 
GENERAL STAFF JOSIP LUCIC ON HIS RECENT APPOINTMENT AND 
EMPHASIZED THE USG DESIRE TO CONTINUE WITH STRONG BILATERAL 
MILITARY COOPERATION.  LUCIC STRONGLY SUPPORTED U.S. 
ENGAGEMENT, AND PARTICULARLY HAILED IMET TRAINING PROGRAMS AS 
AN OUTSTANDING EXAMPLE OF U.S. INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE OF 
CROATIA'S ARMED FORCES.  A RECENT AND ENTHUSIASTIC GRADUATE 
OF AN IMET ENGLISH LANGUAGE TRAINING PROGRAM, LUCIC ASSERTED 
THAT A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF CROATIA'S OFFICERS HAVE BENEFITED 
FROM THE PROGRAMS.  RICARDEL PRESSED LUCIC TO ENSURE THAT 
CROATIAN MILITARY PERSONNEL TRAINED BY U.S. PROGRAMS ARE

DEFMIN ANTUNOVIC: COMMITTED TO REFORMS, LOTS OF WORK AHEAD 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
¶18.  (C) DEFMIN ANTUNOVIC EXPRESSED HER STRONG SATISFACTION 
WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. - CROATIAN BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP.  SHE EXPRESSED REGRET AT NOT BEING ABLE TO BE 
MORE INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH THE WORK OF THE BDC, BUT 
EXPLAINED THAT HER MOD IS SIMULTANEOUSLY HOSTING A PARP 
REVIEW LED BY NATO ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL ALTENBURG. 
ANTUNOVIC DESCRIBED U.S. ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN CAF 
MODERNIZATION, ENHANCED INTEROPERABILITY AND TRAINING AND 
EDUCATION AS ESSENTIAL FOR CROATIA'S PROGRESS.  SHE THANKED 
DASD RICARDEL FOR THE NEW USG COMMITMENT TO HELP CROATIA 
DEVELOP ITS COUNTER-PROLIFERATION ACTIVITIES. 
 
¶19.  (C) DASD RICARDEL PRESSED ANTUNOVIC TO ADDRESS LEGAL 
ISSUES WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY LIMITING U.S. - CROATIA 
BILATERAL MILITARY COOPERATION, SPECIFICALLY FORCE PROTECTION 
AND VISITS OF U.S. NUCLEAR VESSELS.  ANTUNOVIC DESCRIBED GOC 
PLANS TO RESOLVE CURRENT LEGAL LIMITS PREVENTING 
IMPLEMENTATION OF POST-USS COLE FORCE PROTECTION STANDARDS 
ABOARD USN SHIPS IN CROATIAN PORTS.  DEFMIN ANTUNOVIC 
ASSERTED THAT THE CABINET WILL PASS A MEASURE ON FEBRUARY 6 
WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR EXECUTIVE BRANCH APPROVAL OF FORCE 
PROTECTION PRACTICES, WHICH SHOULD CLEAR THE WAY FOR U.S. 
SHIP VISITS TO RESUME.   SHE EXPLAINED THE GOC INTENTIONS TO

PRESENCE OF NUCLEAR POWERED VESSELS IN CROATIA'S INLAND

ACHIEVE. 
 
¶20.  (C) DASD RICARDEL THANKED DEFMIN ANTUNOVIC FOR HER 
POLICY LEADERSHIP IN SUPPORTING THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM. 
ANTUNOVIC ASSERTED THAT THE WAR ON TERROR IS BOTH A CHALLENGE 
AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CROATIA TO SHOW WHAT IT STANDS FOR.
