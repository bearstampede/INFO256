¶1. WASHINGTON AGENCIES APPRECIATE POSTS' EFFORTS TO WALK 
BACK SADC'S DECISION NOT TO ACCEPT USG FUNDS FOR PROJECTS 
THAT PRECLUDE ZIMBABWEAN PARTICIPATION. WE REGRET THAT 
SADC COULD NOT ARRIVE AT A TIMELY DECISION THAT WOULD ALLOW 
USAID'S REGIONAL CENTER FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA (RCSA) TO 
OBLIGATE $22.5 MILLION IN FY03 THROUGH THE SADC 
SECRETARIAT. 
 
¶2. DEPARTMENT CONCURS IN EMBASSY GABORONE'S PROPOSAL TO 
SEND THE FOLLOWING LETTER TO THE SADC EXECUTIVE SECRETARY, 
SIGNED BY THE AMBASSADOR AS THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S 
SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE TO SADC. 
 
DEAR DR. RAMSAMY: 
 
AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED ON MANY OCCASIONS, ONE OF THE UNIQUE 
POSITIVE ASPECTS OF THE U.S.-SADC RELATIONSHIP WAS THE 
PRACTICE BY THE REGIONAL CENTER FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA 
(RCSA) OF OBLIGATING ITS ANNUAL PROGRAM BUDGET OF 
APPROXIMATELY $22 MILLION/YEAR THROUGH THE SADC 
SECRETARIAT. 
 
THIS EXERCISE, UNPRECEDENTED IN OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHER 
REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN AFRICA, HIGHLIGHTED THE SHARED 
GOALS OF SADC AND THE USG FOR THE REGION. 
 
WHILE WE HOPED VERY MUCH TO CONTINUE THIS PRACTICE, WE 
UNDERSTAND THE SECRETARIAT IS UNABLE TO CONFIRM SADC'S 
WILLINGNESS TO DO SO. BECAUSE OF TIME CONSTRAINTS RELATED 
TO THE CLOSING OF OUR FISCAL YEAR, WE ARE UNABLE TO WAIT 
ANY LONGER FOR A SADC DETERMINATION. I AM THEREFORE 
INFORMING YOU THAT RCSA WILL OBLIGATE ITS FUNDS IN A 
DIFFERENT MANNER THIS YEAR AND IN THE FUTURE. THIS 
DECISION MAY ALSO AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE 
TECHNICAL AND OTHER SUPPORT TO THE SADC SECRETARIAT. 
 
WE DEEPLY REGRET THAT SADC HAS BEEN UNABLE TO FIND, AS WE 
HAVE DISCUSSED IN THE PAST, A WAY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH 
THE UNITED STATES IN SPITE OF THE DIFFICULTIES POSED BY THE 
SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE. WHILE THIS HAS CONSTRAINED THE 
WORKING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE USG AND SADC, WE HOPE TO 
CONTINUE OUR POSITIVE DIALOGUE WITH THE SADC SECRETARIAT IN 
SUPPORT OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICA'S REGIONAL GOALS. 
 
                       SINCERELY. 
 
                       JOSEPH HUGGINS 
                       SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE 
                       OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO SADC
