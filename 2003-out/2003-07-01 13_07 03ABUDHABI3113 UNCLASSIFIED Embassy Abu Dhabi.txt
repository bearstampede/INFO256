¶1.  SUMMARY:  AN EDITORIAL IN "AL-BAYAN" STRONGLY CRITICIZED AN 
ALLEGED STATEMENT BY SENATOR GAY GLODIS (SIC) IN WHICH HE 
ALLEGEDLY CALLED FOR BURYING MUSLIMS WITH THE INTESTINES OF PIGS. 
THE EDITORIAL URGED ARAB AND MUSLIM GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE 
RETALIATORY MEASURES AGAINST U.S. INTERESTS TO FORCE WASHINGTON 
TO CHANGE ITS POSITION AND FULLY RESPECT ARABS AND MUSLIMS.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  COMMENTING ON SENATOR GAY GLODIS'S (SIC) ALLEGED REMARKS ON 
THE NEED TO BURY MUSLIMS WITH PIG'S INTESTINES, AN EDITORIAL IN 
THE DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" 6/30 
EDITORIALIZED: 
 
"THE IMAGE OF ARABS AND MUSLIMS IN THE U.S. IS WORSENING.  THE 
ZIONIST-AMERICAN MEDIA HAVE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING THE WORD 'ISLAM' 
EQUIVALENT TO 'TERRORISM,' WHERE EVERY ARAB AND MUSLIM HAS BECOME 
SUSPECT UNLESS HIS BEHAVIOR PROVES HIM INNOCENT...YESTERDAY A 
SHAMELESS SENATOR OPENED FIRE AGAINST MUSLIMS AND RUDELY DEMANDED 
THAT THEY BE BURIED WITH PIGS' INTESTINES.  THE FANATIC 
SENATOR...DISTRIBUTED A MEMORANDUM TO HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE U.S. 
CONGRESS REVEALING THE EXECUTION OF THE SO-CALLED MUSLIM 
EXTREMISTS IN THE PHILIPPINES BY GENERAL JOSEPH PERSHING IN 1913. 
THE EXECUTIONS WERE DONE WITH BULLETS THAT HAD BEEN DIPPED IN 
PIG'S BLOOD, AND THE DEAD WERE LATER BURIED WITH PIGS' 
INTESTINES.  THE SENATOR DEMANDED THAT HISTORY REPEAT ITSELF WITH 
WHAT HE CALLED THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACKS IN IRAQ, MEANING 
THE MEN OF THE IRAQI RESISTANCE.  THIS IS THE VISION THAT 
REFLECTS THE MENTALITY OF THOSE WHO INFLUENCE AMERICAN DECISION- 
MAKING..." 
 
¶3.  "DECISION-MAKERS IN THE U.S. ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH PAMPERING 
ISRAELI TERRORISM BUT ALSO REFUSE TO DEAL OBJECTIVELY AND 
NEUTRALLY WITH THE ARAB AND MUSLIM WORLDS. IT IS DISGRACEFUL TO 
JUST BLAME THE ZIONIST LOBBY ALLIED WITH THE AMERICAN CHRISTIAN 
RIGHT REPRESENTED BY BUSH AND HIS AIDES, AND NOT DO ANYTHING THAT 
WOULD FORCE THE AMERICANS TO RESPECT ARABS AND MUSLIMS.  THE U.S. 
IS USED TO INSULTING ARABS AND MUSLIMS, SO WE MUST INSULT IT 
STRONGLY IN ORDER TO RESTORE ITS SANITY AND MAKE IT UNDERSTAND 
THAT OUR NATION IS NOBLE AND WILL NOT ACCEPT INSULT AND DISDAIN. 
THEN WE MUST STOP THE CALLS FOR CORRECTING OUR IMAGE AND REPLACE 
THIS SHALLOW TALK WITH POLICIES THAT HARM U.S. INTERESTS IN THE 
ARAB AND MUSLIM WORLDS, SO WASHINGTON WILL UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE 
SERIOUS IN FORCING IT TO RESPECT US, OUR RELIGION AND RIGHTS. 
THIS IS THE DUTY OF EACH AND EVERY ARAB AND MUSLIM, BUT FIRST AND 
FOREMOST IT IS THE DUTY OF GOVERNMENTS."
