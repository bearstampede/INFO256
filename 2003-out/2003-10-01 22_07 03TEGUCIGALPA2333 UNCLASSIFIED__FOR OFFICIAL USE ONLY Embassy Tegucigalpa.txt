REF: TEGUCIGALPA 2289 
 
¶1. (U) On September 30 in the Department of Colon on the 
Caribbean coast, Honduran Frontier Police seized another 201 
kilos of cocaine.  This time, the drugs were hidden aboard a 
truck in multiple secret compartments.  Police were alerted 
to the drug's presence by a local source of information who 
reported the truck contained drugs. 
 
¶2. (U) As the vehicle approached a makeshift police 
checkpoint, Honduran authorities motioned the truck to stop. 
The driver refused and continued onward.  Police then pursued 
the vehicle on foot and opened fire, knocking out a tire. 
The driver then stopped and fled on foot with another 
passenger.  Police gave chase but were unable to apprehend 
the suspects.  The police then searched the vehicle and found 
the hidden cocaine. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Honduran press has reported the seized cocaine is 
packaged with similar markings to the approximately 1,026 
kilos police confiscated in Roatan on September 24 (reftel), 
although Post does not believe the shipments to be related. 
This brings the total amount of cocaine seized this year in 
Honduras to 4,949 kilos, more than the last five years 
combined.
