BANDH WELL-OBSERVED, 
USAID VEHICLE DAMAGED BY BRICK 
------------------------------ 
 
¶1.  An April 28 general strike, or bandh, called for the 
Kathmandu Valley by several student groups (reftel) was 
generally well-observed.  A few public and private vehicles 
were seen on the streets, but most Nepalis chose to walk or 
ride bicycles.  Approximately sixty to sixty-five percent of 
shops were closed on the main north-south route through the 
city, though more shops appeared to be open on smaller side 
streets.  One USAID shuttle bus driven by local staff and 
displaying USAID license plates was damaged by a thrown 
brick.  A rear window of the vehicle was broken, but there 
were no passengers at the time and the driver was not hurt. 
Sporadic rock throwing took place in isolated locations 
throughout the city, and there were reports of damage to 
Nepali vehicles.   There were no reports of threats or 
injuries to American Citizens. 
 
STUDENTS CANCEL SECOND DAY OF BANDH, 
MAOIST STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE PROTEST 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Student groups protesting the postponement of school 
elections and the recent hike in petroleum prices canceled 
the second day of the bandh, ostensibly in deference to 
higher secondary school examinations, which start on April 
¶29.   However, the student wing of the Maoists released a 
statement on the morning of April 28 announcing its intention 
to continue with the planned strike.  The Maoist students are 
protesting the recent killings of two of their comrades by 
unknown assailants, and demanding the release of others held 
in government custody.  Embassy-affiliated Lincoln School was 
closed on April 28, and will remain closed on April 29. 
 
GON PROHIBITS PROTEST PROGRAMS 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  On April 27, the Government of Nepal (GON) announced a 
ban on protest programs including processions, sit-ins, and 
hunger strikes in several areas around the capital.  The 
areas designated are near the Royal Palace or GON facilities.
