¶1. (SBU) IN THE COURSE OF A COURTESY CALL BY THE NEW USAID 
DIRECTOR AND THE AMBASSADOR ON MARCH 27, THE AMBASSADOR 
DISCUSSED WITH PLANNING MINISTER BASSAM AWADALLAH THE 
PROPOSED $400,000 MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE (MEPI) 
ELECTION ASSISTANCE. THE PROJECT IS TO BE CARRIED OUT IN 
COOPERATION WITH THE CONSORTIUM FOR ELECTORAL AND POLITICAL 
PROCESS STRENGTHENING (CEPPS).  THE MINISTER, WHOSE SUPPORT 
IS ESSENTIAL FOR THIS PROJECT BECAUSE OF ITS POTENTIAL 
POLITICAL SENSITIVITY IN THIS DIFFICULT PERIOD, AGREED WITH 
THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE, BUT EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
CONSULTING CLOSELY WITH THE GOJ ON ITS IMPLEMENTATION. 
 
¶2. (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR AND THE MINISTER AGREED THAT THEY 
WOULD MEMORIALIZE THEIR AGREEMENT BY COUNTER SIGNED 
IMPLEMENTATION LETTER EARLY NEXT WEEK TO ENSURE THAT THE 
MISSION AND THE PLANNING MINISTRY ARE KEPT FULLY APPRISED OF 
THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELECTION PROJECT. THE 
PROJECT WILL CONSIST OF TRAINING FOR CANDIDATES AND CAMPAIGN 
MANAGERS, PARTICULARLY FOR FEMALE CANDIDATES, AS WELL AS THE 
STRENGTHENING OF POLITICAL PARTIES AND NGO'S INVOLVED IN 
ADVOCATING ISSUES AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE ELECTION PROCESS. 
 
¶3. (SBU) THE MISSION LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH 
NEA AND CEPPS, THE GRANTEE, IN THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION 
OF THIS PROJECT.  WE SUGGEST THAT IF THE    $400,000 IS 
APPROVED, THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS AMMAN, 
IN COORDINATION WITH THE MISSION'S INTERAGENCY MEPI 
COMMITTEE, TO WORK WITH THE GRANTEE CEPPS TO DRAW UP A 
WORKPLAN LEADING UP TO THE JUNE ELECTIONS. 
 
¶2.   WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH NEA ON THIS IMPORTANT 
FORM OF SUPPORT FOR JORDAN'S ELECTIONS, POSSIBLY THE FIRST 
MAJOR ELECTIONS IN THE REGION AFTER THE LIBERATION OF IRAQ 
AND AN IMPORTANT BENCHMARK FOR THE MEPI INITIATIVE.
