SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  MEETING OF IRAQI LEADERS NEAR AL 
NASSERIYA SYRIA'S NEXT 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  THE MEETING OF IRAQI LEADERS NEAR AL NASSERIYA, 
IRAQI DEMONSTRATIONS IN BAGHDAD, MOSUL, AND AL NASSERIYA, AND 
U.S. WARNINGS TO SYRIA DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE MEDIA. 
SECRETARY POWELL'S FOREIGN PRESS CENTER REMARKS AND INTERNATIONAL 
 
SIPDIS 
CONDEMNATION OF THE LOOTING OF BAGHDAD'S MUSEUMS AND LIBRARIES 
ALSO RECEIVED PROMINENT COVERAGE.  MEANWHILE, THE POTENTIAL ROLE 
OF ARAB COUNTRIES IN REBUILDING IRAQ WAS THE MAJOR THEME OF 
TODAY'S EDITORIALS.  AN "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL URGED ARABS TO 
RECOGNIZE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR IRAQ.  IN "AL KHALEEJ," 
COLUMNIST KAMEL ZUHAIR ASSERTED THAT SECRETARY RUMSFELD WAS THE 
ONLY PERSON TO DEFEND THE LOOTING IN IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" CARRIED 
A FRONT-PAGE ARTICLE THAT REPORTED DONALD RUMSFELD'S STATEMENTS 
COMPARING THE LOOTING OF BAGHDAD'S MUSEUMS AND LIBRARIES TO 
LOOTING OCCASIONALLY OCCURRING AT OR AFTER SPORTING EVENTS. 
 
¶3.  COMMENTING ON U.S. WARNINGS TO SYRIA AND URGING AN ARAB ROLE 
IN CONFRONTING THESE THREATS, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL- 
KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 4/16: 
 
"... THE EARTHQUAKE IN IRAQ CREATED AN UNBALANCED SITUATION, BUT 
THERE IS A CHANCE TO REUNITE ALL THAT HAVE BEEN SCATTERED, ALSO 
THERE ARE ABILITIES AND CAPABILITIES FROM WHICH THEY CAN BENEFIT. 
THE ARABS MUST REALIZE THAT SYRIA IS NOT THE ONLY TARGET, AND 
THAT PROTECTING IT IS PROTECTING WHAT REMAINS ON A LONG AMERICAN- 
ZIONIST LIST, REGARDLESS OF THE VIOLENT AND BRUTAL ATTACKS ... 
OTHERWISE, THE IMPRISONING OF ARABS THAT BEGAN IN PALESTINE AND 
CONTINUED TO IRAQ WILL NOT BE LIMITED TO ANY BORDERS." 
 
¶4.  DESCRIBING SECRETARY RUMSFELD AS "THE ENGINEER OF WAR," 
COLUMNIST KAMEL ZUHAIR WROTE IN "AL KHALEEJ" ON 4/16: 
 
"... THE ONLY PERSON DEFENDING THE LOOTING AND STEALING IN IRAQ 
WAS THE ENGINEER OF WAR, RUMSFELD, WHO FOR THE FOURTH TIME GOT 
FED UP WITH THE MEDIA AND ITS TRANSMISSION OF NEWS AND PICTURES 
... RUMSFELD STATED THAT IRAQ WILL MOVE FROM A POLICE STATE TO A 
LIBERATED COMMUNITY THAT EXPRESSES ITSELF THROUGH LOOTING AND 
STEALING.  THE STRATEGIC THINKER RUMSFELD KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT 
WARS OF OCCUPATION AND NOTHING ABOUT WARS FOR LIBERATION ..." 
 
¶5.  URGING AN ARAB ROLE IN REBUILDING IRAQ, SEMI-OFFICIAL ABU 
DHABI-BASED ARABIC DAILY "AL-ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED 4/16: 
 
"... IF ARAB COUNTRIES AND THEIR LEADES DON'T FAMILIARIZE 
THEMSELVES WITH THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES, TO WHICH THEY ARE OBLIGED 
BY BLOOD, RELIGION, LANGUAGE, AND HISTORICAL CONNECTIONS WITH 
THEIR BROTHERS (IN IRAQ), THEN THE REBUILDING OF IRAQ 
POLITICALLY, ECONOMICALLY, AND SOCIALLY IS IN DANGER.  THIS 
DANGER THREATENS NOT ONLY THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ BUT ALSO SYMBOLIZES 
A GREAT ADVERSARY TO ARAB POWER AND ARAB CAPABILITIES, AT A TIME 
WHEN ARABS ARE TRYING TO RISE IN THESE DARK MOMENTS FROM THEIR 
STUMBLINGS THAT THREATENS THEIR PRESENT AND FUTURE." 
 
¶6.  IN A CLOSING STATEMENT, SALEM WROTE IN "AL-KHALEEJ" ON 4/16: 
 
"BURNING THE 'DAR AL HEKMA' NATIONAL LIBRARY IN IRAQ, IN ADDITION 
TO LOOTING AND BURNING THE REST OF THE LIBRARIES IN MOSUL AND 
BASRA, IS NOT A RECKLESS ACTION AND SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE 
LIST OF LOOTING DONE BY BURGLARS AND THIEVES.  THESE FIRES WERE 
MEANT TO ERADICATE A CIVILIZATION AND CULTURE THAT GOES BACK 
THOUSANDS OF YEARS ... IT IS A GREAT CRIME COMMITTED BY THE NEW 
OCCUPIER IN ORDER TO DESTROY THE CULTURE AND HISTORY OF 
MESOPOTAMIA AND GIVING BIRTH TO A NEW CULTURE FROM THE WOMB OF 
OCCUPATION.  WHAT HAPPENED MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IN THIS CONTEXT." 
 
¶7.  "AL KHALEEJ" CARRIED A FRONT-PAGE ARTICLE UNDER THE HEADLINE 
"NEW AMERICAN CURRICULUM IN IRAQ ENDS PRIMACY OF THE ARABIC 
LANGUAGE."  DESPITE THE HEADLINE, THE ARTICLE EMPHASIZED THAT THE 
PRIMARY U.S. AIM IS TO SEPARATE POLITICS FROM EDUCATION AND "DE- 
BA'ATHIFY" THE CURRENT SYSTEM.  THE ARTICLE REPORTED THAT THE NEW 
U.S. SYSTEM WILL UTILIZE MULTIPLE LANGUAGES FOR INSTRUCTION AND 
WILL REFORM CURRENT TEACHING METHODS AND CURRICULA.  THE ARTICLE 
ALLEGED THAT IRAQI STUDENTS WILL BE DEPRIVED FROM LEARNING THEIR 
LINGUISTIC AND CULTURAL HISTORY.
