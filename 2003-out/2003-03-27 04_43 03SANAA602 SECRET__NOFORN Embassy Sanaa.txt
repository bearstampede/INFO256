¶1.  (S/NF)  SUMMARY:  On March 26 Italian Ambassador to Yemen 
called on AMB Hull stating that he had information regarding 
an Iraqi plot to bomb the U.S. Embassy on March 27.  Italians 
arranged for an alleged IIS operative responsible for the 
plot to come to Embassy Sanaa for interview by ORCA.  Subject 
was cooperative and provided credible information on the 
planned attack, which he said he did not/not wish to carry 
out.  Embassy arranged with Yemeni Political Security 
Organization for other members of the attack cell, with their 
explosive devices, to be seized evening of 3/26.  Post is 
considering appropriate follow-on security steps. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (S/NF)  On March 26, 2003, at approximately 1700, Italian 
Ambassador to Yemen Giacomo San Felice visited Embassy Sanaa 
and called on AMB Hull.  Ambassador San Felice stated that he 
had information regarding an Iraqi IIS operative who intended 
to bomb the U.S. Embassy the following day, March 27. 
 
¶3.  (S/NF)  Following discussion in a meeting including ORCA, 
DCM and RSO, Italians arranged for the suspected IIS 
operative and a friend to come to Embassy Sanaa.  They 
arrived at approximately 1800.  After thorough security 
screening procedures, they entered the Chancery and were 
separately interviewed by ORCA. 
 
¶4.  (S/NF)  RSO provided walk-ins' cellular phones to Embassy 
assets for exploitation.and will forward the information 
separate channel. 
 
¶5.  (S/NF)  The walk-in claims to be an IIS asset in command 
of an operational cell.  ORCA finds his claim convincing. 
The man stated he had orders to attack Embassy Sanaa using 
multiple IEDs comprised of 6.8 kg of TNT rigged for timed or 
command detonation.  The Iraqi operative stated that the 
explosives were to be delivered in unspecified packages, 
three with timers and two built for detonation by remote 
control.  The cell realized that the explosions would have 
limited physical effect on the well-fortified Embassy, but 
desired a political effect from the attempt.  The cell also 
undertook surveillance of DATT and PAO residence and Egyptian 
consulate.  The individual has agreed to cooperate, terminate 
the attack and turn over cell members and explosives. 
Further details will be provided via ORCA reporting, 
including knowledge of attacks in 11 other countries. 
 
¶6.  (S/NF)  Based on information provided by the walk-in, 
ORCA arranged with ROYG Political Security Organization (PSO) 
to seize the explosive devices and the three other members of 
the attack cell evening of March 26.  Accordingly, RSO 
believes the attack plan outlined in this report has been 
thwarted. 
 
¶7. (S/NF)  RSO will brief Embassy security assets to be 
vigilant regarding methods of explosive delivery with use of 
timers or remote control devices.  Post will decide on 
appropriate follow-on security measures.
