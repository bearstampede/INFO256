SUBJECT: MEPI - ARABIC BOOK TRANSLATION PROGRAM 
 
REF: SECSTATE 145089 
 
¶1.  POST HAS DISCUSSED SUBJECT PROGRAM WITH RELEVANT  JORDAN 
MINISTRY  OF EDUCATION OFFICIALS. THE MOE IS INTERESTED,  IN 
PRINCIPAL,  IN  PARTICIPATION. HOWEVER, THE  FINAL  DECISION 
MUST  BE MADE BY THE MINISTER HIMSELF, WHO WILL ONLY RESPOND 
TO  A WRITTEN PROPOSAL, AND WHO WOULD WANT TO PERSONALLY VET 
THE  BOOKS BEFORE SENDING THEM TO CLASSROOMS. THAT SAID, THE 
INITIATIVE  TRACKS WELL WITH THE MINISTRY'S OWN EFFORTS  AND 
WOULD MOST LIKELY BE A WELCOME ADDITION TO THEIR PROGRAM FOR 
IMPROVING  CHILDHOOD EDUCATION, PROVIDED THAT THE BOOKS  ARE 
INDEED  CULTURALLY SENSITIVE AND APPROPRIATE  FOR  JORDANIAN 
STUDENTS. 
 
¶2.  SHOULD THE MOE EVENTUALLY DECIDE NOT TO PARTICIPATE,  WE 
EXPECT  THAT A NUMBER OF JORDANIAN PRIVATE SCHOOLS WOULD  BE 
INTERESTED. 
 
¶3.  THERE REMAINS GREAT REGIONAL ANXIETY OVER PERCEIVED U.S. 
INTENTIONS  TO  "INFILTRATE" THE EDUCATION SYSTEMS  OF  ARAB 
COUNTRIES  AND  "CORRUPT" ARAB VALUES.  WITH THIS  IN  MIND, 
JORDANIAN  OFFICIALS WOULD DOUBTLESS BE MORE AMENABLE  TO  A 
LOW  KEY  PROGRAM THAT PRODUCES SOLID BENEFITS TO  CHILDREN, 
BUT WHICH FORGOES HIGH PROFILE MEDIA COVERAGE. 
 
¶4. IF MOE APPROVES, A PILOT PROJECT ON A LIMITED SCALE COULD 
CONCEIVABLY BE LAUNCHED BY JANUARY 2004. 
 
¶5.  WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT THIS INITIATIVE.
