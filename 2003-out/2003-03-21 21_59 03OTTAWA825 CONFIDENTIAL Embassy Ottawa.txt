SUBJECT: CANADA OPPOSES CHR SPECIAL SITTING 
 
REF: A. GENEVA 811 B. STATE 74016 
 
Classified By: POL/MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C)  POL/MC spoke on March 21 with Susan Gregson, Director 
of DFAIT's Human Rights, Humanitarian Affairs and 
International Women's Equality Division, concerning efforts 
to place a special sitting on Iraq on the CHR59 agenda. 
Gregson assured us Canada does not believe a special sitting 
on Iraq is a good idea, and will not support such a proposal. 
Gregson further said that Canada will try to persuade other 
Commission members not to support the special sitting. 
 
¶2. (C)  Gregson's message tracks with what the Canadian 
delegation is saying in Geneva.  We understand, from e-mail 
communications with our delegation, that the Canadian 
delegation  has given assurances they will side with us 
should this proposal comes to a vote.
