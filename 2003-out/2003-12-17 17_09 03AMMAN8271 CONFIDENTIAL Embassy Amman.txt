¶1.  (C)   PolCouns on December 17 delivered to Foreign 
Minister Muasher's private office director Ali al-Ayed and 
deputy director Basheer Zoubi ref A points about the 
Palestinians' intention to introduce a new resolution on 
Palestinian representation to the General Assembly. 
Following up earlier discussions on the matter (ref B), 
PolCouns asked that Jordan attempt to convince the 
Palestinians not to submit such a resolution.  Al-Ayed said 
he understood the U.S. position, and confirmed that Jordan 
had privately discussed this matter with the Palestinians and 
the Egyptians.  He noted that Jordan may not be in a position 
to break Arab consensus supporting the resolution if it is 
brought for a vote, but promised to follow up on the matter.
