SUBJECT:  Former Palestinian PM Abbas visits the UAE 
 
 
(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, Reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.(C) Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for 
Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayed Al-Nahyan (HbZ) 
told the Ambassador October 19 that former Palestinian 
Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) had visited with 
him the previous day and they had had a long discussion. 
Abbas reported that most of the changes he had made to 
the Palestinian security hierarchy and procedures within 
the Palestinian Authority had been reversed by President 
Arafat.  In Abbas' view, new Prime Minister Ahmed Qorei 
is completely under Arafat's control and cannot  and 
will not -- work independently. 
 
2.(C) Abbas and HbZ discussed two possible ways to deal 
with Arafat.  One would be to isolate him in his 
compound, remove his telephones and deny any meetings. 
Eventually, he would give up and leave.  The other way 
would be to grant him the freedom to move about and 
travel in and out of the West Bank/Gaza, but with 
conditions.  Inevitably, one of the conditions would not 
be met and then Sharon could prevent him from returning. 
HbZ told the Ambassador that it is very unlikely that 
Sharon will actually eliminate Arafat because he is too 
valuable for him where he is.  Arafat and Sharon help 
each other out and enable one another, HbZ said. 
 
3.(C) HbZ confirmed to the Ambassador that the UAE would 
be granting UAE citizenship to Abbas' children, but not 
Abu Mazen himself.  Abbas told HbZ that he had no 
intention of leaving the West Bank/Gaza.
