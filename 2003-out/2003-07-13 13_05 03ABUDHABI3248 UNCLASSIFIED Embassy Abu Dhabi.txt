SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  AL KHALEEJ EDITORIAL ON IRAQ 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  AN EDITORIAL IN THE SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY 
"AL-KHALEEJ" DESCRIBED THE SITUATION OF U.S. TROOPS IN IRAQ AS "A 
COSTLY DILEMMA."  THE EDITORIAL CLAIMED THAT THE US LAUNCHED THE 
WAR BASED ON "DECEPTION, FORGERY, AND LIES" AND THAT THE U.S. HAS 
"BEGUN TO HARVEST THE RESULT OF ITS DEEDS."  THE EDITORIAL 
FURTHER ASSERTED THAT THE UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS IN IRAQ EXPLAIN 
IS WHY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION WANTS "TO GET OTHER NATIONS 
INVOLVED IN THIS QUAGMIRE."  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "A QUAGMIRE OF LIES," SHARJAH-BASED PAN- 
ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" 7/12 EDITORIALIZED: 
 
"THREE AMERICAN SITUATIONS IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS CONFIRM 
THAT THE U.S. IS BEGINNING TO FEEL ITS OCCUPATION OF IRAQ HAS 
BECOME A COSTLY DILEMMA ... THE FIRST SITUATION WAS PRESIDENT 
BUSH'S DECLARATION THAT HIS NATION IS FACING A SECURITY PROBLEM 
IN IRAQ.  THE SECOND SITATION WAS SECRETARY POWELL'S ANNOUNCEMENT 
THAT HIS COUNTRY IS DISCUSSING WITH ITS ALLIES A ROLE THAT NATO 
CAN PLAY IN IRAQ.  THE THIRD SITUATION WAS THE UNANIMOUS APPROVAL 
BY THE U.S. SENATE OF A RESOLUTION ENCOURAGING THE AMERICAN 
ADMINISTRATION TO SEEK NATO AND UN'S ASSISTANCE TO MAINTAIN PEACE 
AND SECURITY IN IRAQ ..." 
 
"... THE AMERICAN DILEMMA HAS BEGUN TO TAKE ON A DOMESTIC 
DIMENSION FOLLOWING THE REVELATION OF A SCANDAL OF LIES USED BY 
U.S. ADMINISTRATION TO JUSTIFY ITS AGGRESSION AGAINST IRAQ BASED 
ON CLAIMS THAT IRAQ POSSESSES WMD.   ALSO, THE BAD PLANNING OF 
THE WAR AND ITS CONSEQUENCES HAVE ELICITED SHARP CRITICISMS FROM 
CONGRESS AND SENIOR AMERICAN OFFICIALS .... THOSE WHO LAUNCHED 
THEIR WAR THROUGH DECEPTION, FORGERY, AND LIES HAVE BEGUN TO 
HARVEST THE RESULT OF THEIR DEEDS.  THEY ARE DROWNING IN A 
QUAGMIRE OF LIES AND ARE TRYING TO GET OTHERS INVOLVED IN THIS."
