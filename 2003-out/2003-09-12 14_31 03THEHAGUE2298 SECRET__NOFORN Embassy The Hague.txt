THE HAGUE RESPONSE, INCLUDING AMSTERDAM, TO REFTEL IS AS 
FOLLOWS: 
 
POLITICAL VIOLENCE 
 
¶1. (SBU) DEMONSTRATIONS 
 
¶A.    ARE THERE ANY ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN COUNTRY 
THAT ARE CAPABLE OF CARRYING OUT SIGNIFICANT ANTI-AMERICAN 
DEMONSTRATIONS? 
 
-YES, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MUSLIM IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES, 
TURKS (300,000), MOROCCANS (280,000), IRAQIS (33,000), 
SOMALIS (29,000) AND IRANIANS 23,000) IN THE NETHERLANDS THAT 
WOULD 
CARRY OUT ANTI-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATIONS IF SUITABLY STIMULATED 
BY THEIR COMMUNITY LEADERS.  THE NETHERLANDS IS HOME TO THE 
LARGEST AFGHAN REFUGEE COMMUNITY IN WESTERN EUROPE, PERHAPS 
30,000 PERSONS.  THERE ARE ALSO NON-MUSLIM GROUPS THAT WOULD 
CARRY OUT ANTI-MILITARY DEMONSTRATIONS (ANTI-WAR, PRO-PEACE, 
ANTI-DEATH PENALTY, ETC) AT MILITARY FACILITIES OF US, NL, OR 
NATO. ANTI-GLOBALIZATION GROUPS ARE ACTIVE, ESPECIALLY IN 
AMSTERDAM. 
 
¶B. HAVE THERE BEEN ANTI-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE 
COUNTRY WITHIN THE LAST 12 MONTHS? 
 
-YES 
 
¶C. HAVE THESE DEMONSTRATIONS TAKEN PLACE NEAR OR IN FRONT OF 
U.S. DIPLOMATIC FACILITIES? 
 
-YES-BOTH IN THE HAGUE AND AMSTERDAM. 
 
¶D. WHAT IS THE AVERAGE SIZE OF AN ANTI-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATION? 
 
-ANTI-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATIONS ARE USUALLY COMPRISED OF A FEW 
(4 OR 5) PERSONS WITH LARGE-SCALE DEMONSTRATIONS RANGING FROM 
200 TO 300 PERSONS. THERE WAS AN ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATION ON 
FEBRUARY 15, 2003 DURING THE WORLD-WIDE DEMONSTRATION, THAT 
WAS COMPRISED OF APPROXIMATELY 30,000 TO 50,000 PERSONS THAT 
TOOK PLACE IN AMSTERDAM BUT WAS NOT IN THE VICINITY OF THE 
CONSULATE GENERAL. THE MAYOR OF AMSTERDAM HAS FORBIDDEN 
DEMONSTRATORS IN THE VICINITY OF THE CONSULATE. 
 
¶E. ARE THESE ANTI-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATIONS USUALLY TRIGGERED 
BY U.S. FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVES OR MILITARY ACTIONS OR BY 
DOMESTIC ISSUES? 
 
-DEMONSTRATIONS ARE USUALLY TRIGGERED BY U.S. FOREIGN POLICY 
INITIATIVES OR MILITARY ACTIONS. CURRENTLY, THE MOST COMMON 
TRIGGER IS THE WAR WITH IRAQ. OPPOSITION TO THE DEATH PENALTY 
IS WIDESPREAD IN THE NETHERLANDS AND MEMBERS OF THESE GROUP 
HAVE PROTESTED AT THE EMBASSY AND CONSULATE GENERAL IN THE 
PAST. 
 
¶F. ARE THESE DEMONSTRATIONS GENERALLY VIOLENT OR PEACEFUL? 
 
-GENERALLY PEACEFUL.  DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE HAGUE ARE OFTEN 
 MORE POLITICALLY FOCUSED WHILE THOSE IN AMSTERDAM ARE OFTEN 
 "MEDIA EVENTS/STREET THEATER". 
 
¶G. IF VIOLENT, HAVE ANY DEMONSTRATIONS RESULTED IN DAMAGE TO 
USG PROPERTY OR INJURIES TO USG EMPLOYEES? 
 
-USG EMPLOYEES HAVE NOT SUSTAINED INJURIES AS A RESULT OF 
DEMONSTRATIONS. AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE HAS SUSTAINED DAMAGE THAT 
INCLUDED SPRAY PAINT ON THE EMBASSY FAADE AND A BROKEN 
ROLL-DOWN SHUTTER AS A RESULT OF A DEMONSTRATION ON MARCH 1, 
¶2003. ROCKS, BRICKS AND BOTTLES HAVE BEEN THROWN AT THE 
CONSULATE GENERAL NUMEROUS TIMES, RESULTING IN DAMAGE TO 
VEHICLES AND CONSULATE WINDOWS, BUT THESE INCIDENTS DID NOT 
OCCUR DURING DEMONSTRATIONS. 
- IN EARLY 2003, DEMONSTRATORS CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO 
ANTENNAS AT A US AIR FORCE COMMAND AND CONTROL FACILITY 
LOCATED ON THE VOLKEL AIR BASE IN SOUTHERN NETHERLANDS. 
 
 
¶H. IF VIOLENT, HAVE ANY DEMONSTRATORS EVER PENETRATED OUR 
PERIMETER SECURITY LINE? 
 
-YES, ON MARCH 1, 2003, SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS OUT OF A 300 
PERSON DEMONSTRATION, ENTERED THE NEW TEMPORARY PERIMETER 
FENCE AT U.S. EMBASSY IN THE HAGUE, SPRAY PAINTED ANTI-WAR 
AND ANTI-US SLOGANS ON THE EMBASSY FAADE, THREW BOTTLES AND 
SPONGES, AND PLACED PICKET SIGNS IN THE FENCE, WHILE POLICE 
WATCHED AND FAILED TO INTERVENE. THE  GOVERNMENT IS 
CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE 
PROMISED NON-RECURRENCE. 
-DEMONSTRATORS FREQUENTLY ENTER VOLKEL AIR BASE IN SOUTHERN 
NETHERLANDS, A BASE USED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE, BY CUTTING 
THE FENCE ALONG THE BASE PERIMETER. THE DEMONSTRATORS USUALLY 
AVOID USG FACILITIES ON THE BASE PREFERRING TO DEFACE AND 
CAUSE MINOR DAMAGE TO NL PROPERTY. IN EARLY MAR 2003, 
DEMONSTRATORS AGAIN RETURNED TO THE US AIR FORCE COMMAND AND 
CONTROL FACILITY (SEE PARAGRAPH I ABOVE) AND PAINTED GRAFFITI 
ON ALL FOUR WALLS AFTER CUTTING THROUGH THE FENCE SURROUNDING 
THIS BUILDING.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO INJURIES TO USG PERSONNEL 
AS A RESULT OF THESE DEMONSTRATIONS AT VOLKEL. 
 
 ¶I. HAVE THERE BEEN ANTI-GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE 
COUNTRY WITHIN THE LAST 12 MONTHS? 
 
-YES, ALTHOUGH THESE ARE FREQUENT, THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS 
PEACEFUL. 
 
¶J. HAVE THESE DEMONSTRATIONS TAKEN PLACE NEAR OR IN FRONT OF 
U.S. DIPLOMATIC FACILITIES? 
 
-YES.  WHILE THE DEMONSTRATIONS TAKE PLACE AT THE DUTCH 
PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS ABOUT 0.5 KM AWAY, THE ASSEMBLY POINT 
FOR MOST DEMONSTRATIONS IS IN A FIELD LOCATED A BLOCK AWAY 
FROM THE EMBASSY. THE ROUTE OF MARCH FOR MOST DEMONSTRATIONS 
GOES DIRECTLY PAST THE SIDE OF THE EMBASSY. 
 
¶K. WHAT IS THE AVERAGE SIZE OF AN ANTI-GOVERNMENT 
DEMONSTRATIONS? 
 
-500-1000 PERSONS 
 
¶L. ARE THESE DEMONSTRATIONS GENERALLY VIOLENT OR PEACEFUL? 
 
-GENERALLY BUT NOT ALWAYS PEACEFUL. 
 
¶M. IF VIOLENT, HAVE ANY DEMONSTRATIONS RESULTED IN DAMAGE TO 
USG PROPERTY? 
 
-WITH REGARD TO ANTI-GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATIONS, NO USG 
PROPERTY HAS BEEN DAMAGED RECENTLY ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN 
DAMAGE TO 
EMBASSY EMPLOYEES, POVS PARKED IN THE VICINITY OF THE 
CHANCERY IN THE PAST. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) MACRO CONFLICT CONDITIONS 
 
¶A. IS THE HOST COUNTRY CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN AN INTERSTATE OR 
INTRASTATE CONFLICT?  (THIS MAY INCLUDE BATTLES BETWEEN 
ORGANIZED AND VIOLENT DRUG CARTELS) 
 
-NO, EXCEPT AS A MEMBER OF THE US LED COALITION AGAINST 
GLOBAL TERRORISM. 
-THE GOVERNMENT OF THE NETHERLANDS IS THE LEAD PARTNER ALONG 
WITH THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE NETHERLANDS ANTILLES AND ARUBA IN 
THE NETHERLANDS ANTILLES AND ARUBA COAST GUARD (NAACG). THE 
NAACG IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN COMBATING DRUG TRAFFICKING INTO 
THE NETHERLANDS ANTILLES AND ARUBA FROM SOUTH AMERICA.  THERE 
ARE OCCASIONALLY VIOLENT CLASHES BETWEEN COAST GUARD UNITS 
AND DRUG SMUGGLERS NEAR THE ISLANDS OF THE NETHERLANDS 
ANTILLES AND ARUBA. 
 
¶B. IF AN INTRASTATE CONFLICT, IS IT AN INSURGENCY THAT IS 
LIMITED TO A SPECIFIC REGION OR A COUNTRYWIDE CIVIL WAR? 
 
-N/A 
 
¶C. IF LIMITED TO A SPECIFIC REGION, ARE ANY U.S. DIPLOMATIC 
FACILITIES LOCATED IN THIS REGION? 
 
- YES. THERE IS A UNITED STATES CONSULATE LOCATED IN 
WILLEMSTAD, CAPITAL OF THE NETHERLANDS ANTILLES ON THE ISLAND 
OF CURACAO. 
 
¶D. HAVE ANY OF THE FACTIONS INVOLVED IN THESE INTRASTATE 
CONFLICTS SIGNALED OR DEMONSTRATED AN ANTI-AMERICAN 
ORIENTATION? 
 
-NO 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) HOST COUNTRY CAPABILITIES 
 
¶A.    ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES PROFESSIONAL AND 
WELL-TRAINED? 
-YES, LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE WELL TRAINED BUT ADHERE 
TO POLICIES THAT DIFFER FROM THE UNITED STATES, WITH REGARDS 
TO REGULATING DEMONSTRATIONS AND RESPONDING TO INCIDENTS. 
¶B.    HAVE THEY BEEN TRAINED BY U.S. AGENCIES?  IF SO, PLEASE 
ELABORATE ON EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAINING. 
 
-NOT IN GENERAL, ALTHOUGH THERE IS COOPERATION AND 
CROSS-TRAINING ON SPECIFIC ISSUES. 
 
¶C. ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CONFRONTED WITH SERIOUS, 
WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION INSIDE THEIR AGENCIES? 
 
-NO, CORRUPTION DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A PROBLEM GENERALLY, 
ALTHOUGH THERE WERE RECENT DRUG-DEALING CHARGES AGAINST SOME 
AMSTERDAM POLICE OFFICERS. A MORE WIDESPREAD PROBLEM HAS BEEN 
OFF-DUTY USE OF SOFT DRUGS.  INFORMATION GATHERED BY THE U.S. 
DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY ALLEGES THAT THE ROTTERDAM PORT AND 
SCHIPHOL AIRPORT HAVE A CORRUPTION PROBLEM INVOLVING DRUGS. 
 
¶D. ARE THE SECURITY SERVICES PROFESSIONAL AND CAPABLE OF 
DETERRING TERRORIST ACTIONS? 
 
-YES, COMPARABLE TO OTHER WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. MOST 
RECENT SUCCESS WAS THE BEGHAL INVESTIGATION (2 YEARS). ARE 
THE SECURITY SERVICES PROFESSIONAL AND CAPABLE OF 
DETERRING TERRORIST ACTIONS? 
 
-YES, COMPARABLE TO OTHER WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. MOST 
RECENT SUCCESS, ALMOST TWO YEARS ALMOST 2 YEARS (BEGHAL). THE 
MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS &ARE THE SECURITY SERVICES 
WILLING TO DETER TERRORIST ACTIONS? IN THIS SCORE, THE DUTCH 
SERVICES, AS WITH THEIR POLITICIANS, ARE NOT PROACTIVE. THEY 
ARE NOT CAPABLE OF DETERRING TERRORISM BECAUSE THEY DO NOT 
HAVE ROBUST HUMINT CAPABILITIES AND THEIR USE OF IMBEDDED 
SOURCES IS EXTREMELY LIMITED, THUS SEVERELY LIMITING THEIR 
EFFECTIVENESS. 
 
 
¶E. HAVE THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES BEEN COOPERATIVE WITH U.S. 
EMBASSY REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AND SUPPORT? 
 
-THE NETHERLANDS STILL DOES NOT HAVE A WORKING INTELLIGENCE 
COLLECTION/ANALYSIS AGENCY AND INSTEAD HAS A SECURITY AGENCY. 
THE SECURITY AGENCY IS MOSTLY COOPERATIVE WITH U.S. EMBASSY 
REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AND SUPPORT, HOWEVER LOCAL PRIVACY 
LAWS INHIBIT THE SHARING OF &PERSONAL INFORMATION8 ON 
ARRESTED PERSONS. ALSO, CULTURAL PRE-DISPOSITION TOWARDS 
AVOIDING A PROACTIVE STANCE HAS LIMITED COOPERATION FROM 
REACHING A LEVEL WHICH THE EMBASSY HAS SOUGHT. 
 
 
¶F. ASSUMING THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST THREATS IN 
RECENT YEARS, HAVE HOST COUNTRY SECURITY SERVICES BEEN ABLE 
TO SCORE ANY MAJOR 
ANTI-TERRORISM SUCCESSES? 
 
-YES, TWICE IN THE LAST YEAR. 
 
¶G. HAS HOST COUNTRY BEEN RESPONSIVE (RE: TIMELINESS AND 
ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES) TO EMBASSY REQUESTS FOR PROTECTIVE 
SECURITY? 
 
-AMEMBASSY THE HAGUE HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN CONSTANT DIALOGUE 
WITH THE GONL SINCE 9/11/01 SEEKING ENHANCED SECURITY FOR ALL 
U.S. MISSION ELEMENTS. THE HOST NATION GOVERNMENT CONTINUES 
TO REFUSE TO PUT NEEDED BARRIERS AND SURVEILLANCE IN PLACE. 
THE JERSEY BARRIERS ARE INEFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING A VBIED 
ATTACK. THE EMBASSY REMAINS VULNERABLE TO PENETRATION BY 
SMALL GROUPS OF PERSONNEL AS WELL AS TO MORE DRAMATIC TRUCK 
BOMB ATTACKS. 
THE GONL IS PLANNING A TRANSITION, THE EXACT DETAILS OF WHICH 
ARE STILL NOT YET KNOWN, WHICH INVOLVES REPLACING THE 
MILITARY POLICE WITH LOCAL POLICE OFFICERS ARMED WITH SIDE 
ARMS AS OPPOSED TO LONG ARMS. SPECIFICS SUCH AS WHETHER THE 
LOCAL POLICE WOULD BE PRESENT INSIDE THE EMBASSY PERIMETER 
ARE YET TO BE DETERMINED. AS A RESULT OF THE PLANNED 
TRANSITION, THE GONL RECENTLY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF MILITARY 
POLICE PRESENCE AT BOTH THE U.S. EMBASSY IN THE HAGUE AND THE 
CONSULATE GENERAL IN AMSTERDAM FROM 6 TO 3 OFFICERS AND 
REDUCED THE WORKING HOURS, BOTH WITHOUT ANY PRIOR NOTICE. 
REPEATED REQUESTS HAVE RESULTED IN A TEMPORARY INCREASE IN 
MILITARY POLICE PRESENCE AT THE EMBASSY FROM 3 TO 5 MILITARY 
POLICE. DETAILS REGARDING PLANS FOR THE TRANSITION ARE YET TO 
BE DETERMINED BY THE GONL. 
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ERECTED A CROWD-CONTROL BARRIER 
APPROXIMATELY 30 YARDS FROM THE PERIMETER GATE, INCREASING 
THE SET-BACK OF THE EMBASSY. THE SET-BACK DISTANCE AND FENCE 
HEIGHT HOWEVER, STILL DO NOT MEET DS REQUIREMENTS AND ARE NOT 
SUFFICIENT. 
UPON ENGAGEMENT OF WAR WITH IRAQ ON MARCH 20,2003, THE LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT CLOSED THE STREETS RUNNING IN FRONT AND ON THE 
SIDE OF THE EMBASSY TO VEHICULAR TRAFFIC, ALTHOUGH THE 
STREETS HAVE SINCE BEEN RE-OPENED 
 
¶H. HOW DOES THE EMBASSY ASSESS THE OVERALL SECURITY AT MAJOR 
AIRPORTS IN THE COUNTRY? (EXCELLENT; VERY GOOD, GOOD/AVERAGE; 
POOR) 
 
-VERY GOOD TO EXCELLENT DUE TO SIGNIFICANT POST 9/11 UPGRADES 
AT SCHIPHOL AIRPORT, THE PREMIER DUTCH AIRPORT AND THE THIRD 
BUSIEST IN EUROPE. 
 
¶I. HOW EFFECTIVE ARE CUSTOMS AND IMMIGRATION CONTROLS 
AGENCIES? (EFFECTIVE; AVERAGE; INEFFECTIVE) 
 
-THE CUSTOMS AGENCY IS A SIGNATORY OF THE SCHENGEN TREATY, A 
RESULT OF WHICH IS THAT THERE ARE NO CONTROL POINTS ON LAND 
BORDERS.  DUTCH CUSTOMS OCCASIONALLY DOES SPOT CHECKS AT LAND 
BORDERS.  AS OF 09/03/2002 US CUSTOMS CONTAINER SECURITY 
INITIATIVE (CSI) IS ACTIVE AT THE PORT OF ROTTERDAM.  THIS 
PILOT PROGRAM IS A CO0PERATIVE EFFORT OF NL AND US CUSTOMS. 
-IMMIGRATION: EFFECTIVE. BORDER CONTROLS AT SCHIPHOL AIRPORT 
AND AT SEAPORTS ARE HANDLED BY THE ROYAL MARECHAUSSEE 
(MILITARY CONSTABULARY KNOWN AS KMAR), A VERY EFFECTIVE 
BRANCH OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE. 
THE DUTCH IMMIGRATION SERVICE (IND) IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE 
FUNCTION 
AND DOES NOT HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BORDER CONTROLS, HOWEVER 
A 
JOINT IND-INS COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT HAS RESULTED IN TWO INS 
AGENTS ASSIGNED TDY TO SCHIPHOL AIRPORT TO ASSIST BOTH THE 
KMAR AND IND AND IMPROVE INTELLIGENCE SHARING, PARTICULARLY 
TERRORIST INFORMATION. 
 
¶J. HOW EFFECTIVE ARE BORDER PATROL FORCES? (EFFECTIVE; 
AVERAGE; INEFFECTIVE) 
 
-SEE (I) ABOVE. 
 
 
INDIGENOUS TERRORISM 
 
¶4. (SBU) ANTI-AMERICAN TERRORIST GROUPS 
 
¶A. ARE THERE INDIGENOUS, ANTI-AMERICAN TERRORIST GROUPS IN 
COUNTRY? 
 
-NONE THAT IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS SUCH THAT WE ARE AWARE OF. 
HOWEVER, THE NETHERLANDS IS A KNOWN SANCTUARY FOR NUMEROUS 
ANTI-U.S. FOREIGN-BASED GROUPS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT 
CONSIDER THEMSELVES AFFILIATED WITH SUCH GROUPS. 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) OTHER INDIGENOUS TERRORIST GROUPS 
 
¶A. ARE THERE OTHER INDIGENOUS TERRORIST GROUPS (NOT 
ANTI-AMERICAN) IN COUNTRY? 
 
-YES 
 
               ¶B. IF YES, HOW MANY? PLEASE NAME GROUPS. 
 
-ONE:  RA-RA  (NOW INACTIVE FOR APPROX. 3 YEARS) 
REVOLUTIONARY 
ANTI-RACISM ALLIANCE, AN ULTRA LEFTIST GROUP FIRST ORGANIZED 
TO PROTEST 
SOUTH AFRICAN APARTHEID AND RACIST SENTIMENT IN THE 
NETHERLANDS. 
THIS GROUP WAS VIOLENTLY OPPOSED TO RESTRICTIONS ON GRANTING 
REFUGEE STATUS. THEY HAVE USED ARSON AND BOMBS IN THE PAST. 
THE LARGEST COUNTRY 
WIDE MEMBERSHIP IS IN/AROUND AMSTERDAM 
 
¶C. HAVE THESE GROUPS CARRIED OUT ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL OR IN 
AREAS WHERE U.S. DIPLOMATIC FACILITIES ARE LOCATED? 
 
-YES, THE MOST RECENT WAS APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS AGO. 
RECENTLY HOWEVER, TELEPHONIC/HOAX BOMB THREATS OCCURRED IN 
WHICH THE CALLER CLAIMED TO BE A MEMBER OF RA-RA. 
 
¶D.    WERE THESE ATTACKS LETHAL AND/OR INDISCRIMINATE? 
 
- A BOMB WAS PLANTED IN A PUBLIC TOILET OF A NETHERLANDS 
GOVERNMENT BUILDING, WHICH DID NOT RESULT IN ANY DEATHS. 
¶E. HAVE ANY AMERICANS EVER BEEN KILLED OR INJURED IN THESE 
ATTACKS? 
 
-NO 
 
TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM 
¶6. (SBU) TRANSNATIONAL TERRORIST INDICATORS 
 
¶A. ARE THERE ANY FOREIGN TERRORIST GROUPS THAT HAVE A 
PRESENCE IN COUNTRY? PROVIDE NAMES. 
 
(S/NF)-REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE'S LIBERATION PARTY/FRONT 
(TURKEY) (DHKP/C), KURDISTAN WORKERS' PARTY (TURKEY) (PKK), 
EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD (AL-JIHAD) (EIJ), AL-GAMA' AT 
AL-ISLAMIYYA (ISLAMIC GROUP) (EIG), ARMED ISLAMIC GROUP (GIA) 
SOCIAL, SALAFI GROUP FOR CALL AND COMBAT (ALGERIA)- GIA 
FACTION (GSPC), AL QAI'DA, HAMAS, AND THE NEW PEOPLES, 
ARMY/COMMUNIST 
PARTY OF THE PHILIPPINES. THE ARAB EUROPEAN LEAGUE (AEL) HAS 
A NASCENT PRESENCE IN THE NETHERLANDS. 
 
 
¶B. HOW DOES THE EAC ASSESS THIS PRESENCE? IS IT AN 
OPERATIONAL CELL? FINANCIAL CELL? SUPPORT CELL? PROPAGANDA 
CELL? 
 
(S/NF)- SOME OPERATIONAL CELLS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WHILE 
OTHERS ARE SUPPORT AND FINANCIAL CELLS. THE DUTCH HAVE 
RECENTLY FROZEN THE ASSETS OF A HAMAS-RELATED CHARITY IN THE 
NETHERLANDS. 
AN OPERATIONAL CELL RECRUITED AND DISPATCHED TWO NETHERLANDS 
BORN AND RAISED YOUNG MEN OF MOROCCAN BACKGROUND TO THE JIHAD 
IN AFGHANISTAN. THE TWO WOUND UP IN INDIAN CONTROLLED KASMIR 
AND WERE KILLED ATTACKING INDIAN SECURITY FORCES. 
A SUPPORT CELL WAS RUNNING THE ROTTERDAM SAFEHOUSE ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE BEHGAL PLOT TO BLOW UP AMEMBASSY PARIS.  IN APRIL 
AUTHORITIES ARRESTED MEMBERS OF A GSPC CELL IN NORTHERN 
NETHERLANDS THAT IS PRESUMED TO HAVE BEEN AN OPERATIONAL 
CELL. ON 08/30/02 GONL SECURITY FORCES ARRESTED 12 
&JIHADIST8 REPORTEDLY ASSOCIATED WITH AL QA,IDA AND GSPC. 
AS OF JULY 2003, MOST HAVE BEEN RELEASED WITHOUT CHARGES. 
OTHERS REMAINING IN CUSTODY WILL NOT BE CHARGED WITH ANY 
TERRORIST-RELATED OFFENSES. ONE WAS DEPORTED ON IMMIGRATION 
CHARGES. 
ADDITIONALLY NL AUTHORITIES ARE ACTIVELY MONITORING MORE THEN 
100 INDIVIDUALS WITH KNOWN OR SUSPECTED AFFILIATIONS TO 
NUMEROUS TRANSNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. THE 
ARAB-EUROPEAN LEAGUE (AEL), AN ISLAMIC EXTREMIST ORGANIZATION 
WITH HEADQUARTERS IN BELGIUM AND BRANCHES IN THE NETHERLANDS, 
GERMANY, FRANCE, THE UK, LEBANON, LIBYA AND SYRIA, CLAIMS TO 
BE STRIVING AFTER EMANCIPATION OF ARABS AND MUSLIMS IN EUROPE 
BY DEMANDING WHAT IS ALREADY &RIGHTFULLY THEIRS8. THE 
ORGANIZATION, LED BY ABOU JAHJAH (DPOB 24 JUNE 1971; LEBANON 
BINT JAIL), HAS SO FAR REMAINED WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE 
LAW IN THE NETHERLANDS, THOUGH IT HAS STAGED VIOLENT 
DEMONSTRATIONS IN BELGIUM.  ACCORDING TO DUTCH SECURITY 
OFFICIALS, THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT IF WAR AGAINST IRAQ 
BREAKS OUT, THE AEL MAY RESORT TO CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE OR EVEN 
TO VIOLENCE IN THE NETHERLANDS. 
 
¶C.    IS THE HOST GOVERNMENT SYMPATHETIC TO THESE GROUPS? 
 
-NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST 
 
¶D. ARE THERE SUSPECT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) IN 
THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY OF THESE GROUPS? 
 
-YES, SEVERAL EXIST AND ARE ALLOWED TO OPERATE RATHER FREELY 
BECAUSE OF THE LIBERAL DUTCH ATTITUDE WHICH TENDS TO 
INAPPROPRIATELY MINIMIZE THIS RESPONSE. 
 
¶E. ARE THERE ANY ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN COUNTRY 
THAT ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THESE GROUPS? 
 
-YES--RADICAL ISLAMICS, OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT 
ETHNIC SUBGROUPS IN THE NETHERLANDS. 
 
¶F. HOW DOES THE EAC ASSESS THE LEVEL, INTENT, AND SCOPE OF 
HOSTILE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (IRAN, IRAQ, SYRIA, SERBIA, 
SUDAN, ET. AL.) IN COUNTRY RELATIVE TO POTENTIAL 
ANTI-AMERICAN TERRORIST ACTS? 
 
(S/NF)-WITH THE EXCEPTION OF IRAQ, LOW PROBABILITY OF A 
HOSTILE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE SUPPORTING TERRORIST ACTS 
IN-COUNTRY.  HOST GOVERNMENT WOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS THAT 
WOULD NEGATE THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. 
¶G. HOW DOES THE EAC ASSESS THE AVAILABILITY OF WEAPONS AND 
EXPLOSIVES IN COUNTRY OR FROM NEARBY COUNTRIES FOR HOSTILE 
TERRORIST ELEMENTS? 
 
-LEGAL POSSESSION OF FIREARMS IS CLOSELY CONTROLLED 
IN-COUNTRY, AS ARE 
EXPLOSIVES. HAVING SAID THAT, SHOOTINGS ARE BECOMING MORE 
COMMON AND RICHARD &SHOE-BOMBER8 REID IS ALLEGED TO HAVE 
ACQUIRED HIS SHOE BOMB IN AMSTERDAM. PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES AND 
HAND GRENADES ARE BECOMING MORE EASILY OBTAINABLE IN THE 
NETHERLANDS. CRIMINAL GANGS HAVE READY ACCESS TO FIREARMS. 
SHIPMENTS OF ILLEGAL WEAPONS ARE FROM TIME TO TIME UNCOVERED 
IN MARINE MERCHANT 
VESSELS DOCKING IN THE BENELUX.  RECENT REPORTS INDICATE THAT 
THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THE INCREASING NUMBER OF ILLEGAL 
WEAPONS IS FROM THE BALKANS THROUGH GERMANY INTO THE 
NETHERLANDS. REPORTS ALSO INDICATE THAT WEAPONS AND NARCOTICS 
ARE BEING TRADED BETWEEN THE NETHERLANDS, SOUTH AMERICA AND 
OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. 
 
THIS CONCLUDES THE HAGUE REPORT.
