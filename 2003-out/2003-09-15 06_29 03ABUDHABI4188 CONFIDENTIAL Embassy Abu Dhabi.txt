SUBJECT: UAEG REQUESTS INFORMATION ON OCTOBER EXBS COURSES 
 
REF: ABU DHABI 3372 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (U) This is an action request; please see paragraph 4. 
 
¶3.  (C) Post has received repeated inquiries from the UAE 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the two EXBS-funded courses, 
WMD Commodity Identification and Legal Technical 
Forum, notionally scheduled for October (see reftel). 
The UAEG has a strong commitment to selecting appropriate 
participants for this important, initial export 
controls training.  But as the result of a complicated 
interagency process, we are concerned that the Emiratis may face 
difficulties organizing course participation in 
less than four weeks. 
 
¶4.  (C) Action request: Post would appreciate answers to 
questions posed in reftel and information soonest on proposed 
training dates, tentative course agendas, and 
description of ideal participants.  If we do not receive these 
specifics soon, we would recommend that the interagency 
propose training dates in December to ensure the 
best possible UAEG participation.  End action request.
