SUBJECT: TURKEY MOVES CLOSER TO ACCEPTING OFFER TO ACQUIRE 
ANTHRAX VACCINES

(U) Classified by Economic Counselor Scot A. Marciel. 
Reasons: 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
1.(U) We have received a faxed letter (4/3) from MFA advising 
that the Turkish Government plans to use unobligated FY 2002 
FMF to finance the acquisition of 10,000 doses (only) of 
anthrax vaccine.  The letter requests confirmation on the 
availability of the vaccine, date and delivery logistics, and 
other related information. 
 
 
¶2. (C) The MFA letter indicated the amount of $230,310 for 
the acquisition, a figure that M. Turker Ari, MFA First 
Secretary, says came from the Turkish General Staff. EconOff 
 
SIPDIS 
pointed out that our respective military colleagues would 
ultimately handle the transaction but that the MFA letter 
quoted an outdated price, neglected to reference 
transportation and administrative costs, and omitted any 
reference to previous requests for training for healthcare 
providers.  Ari said he would meet with the TGS 
representatives on 4/8 to discuss pricing and training issues 
and would return to us with a final decision tomorrow. 
 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT. We understand that there are more than 
sufficient funds available in Turkey's FMF account to cover 
an updated anthrax vaccine estimate, transportation and 
administrative costs and training and are relatively 
optimistic that the deal will go through.  We will continue 
to follow up and report.
