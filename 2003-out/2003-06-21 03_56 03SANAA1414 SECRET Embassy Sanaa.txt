Classified By: Charges D'Affaires Alan G. Misenheimer for Reasons 1.5 ( 
b,c,d) 
 
¶1.  (S/NF)  On June 18, before a meeting with FM Qirbi (see 
septels), Charge 
delivered the USG response to the ROYG request for 
information on Salah 
al-Muktar, the Saddam-era Iraqi Ambassador to Vietnam, to 
Abdul Hakim 
al-Iryani, Advisor to Foreign Minister Qirbi.  Iryani noted 
that the text (see 
para 4) appeared rather ambivalent, and did not explicitly 
answer the key 
question on Muktar's affiliation with the Iraqi Intelligence 
Service. 
Iryani also confirmed that Muktar arrived in Sanaa on Monday, 
June 16, and 
is in the care of a group of Iraqis living in Sanaa. 
 
¶2.  (S/NF)  FM Qirbi opened the 6/18 meeting with a plea for 
a quicker response 
to ROYG's requests for information.  Qirbi noted that some 
Iraqi officials 
whose names ROYG submitted to the U.S. for vetting (see 
septels) have since 
pulled their applications for asylum in Yemen, but did not 
offer specifics. 
ROYG faces a potential problem, said Qirbi, because some 
Iraqis are coming into 
the country without advising ROYG in advance -- Iraqis, like 
some other Arab 
nationals, do not require visas to enter Yemen. 
 
¶3.  (S/NF)  During a telcon with PolOff on 6/16, Iryani said 
the next request 
for USG vetting would include a high-level diplomat 
(Ambassador or 
DCM-equivalant) from Azerbiajan.  Post expects to receive the 
new list, as well 
as contact information for the ROYG mission in Baghdad, on 
Saturday, June 21.
