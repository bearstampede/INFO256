¶1.  Starting in 1993, Mission has used funds from the 
International Narcotics Control program for equipment 
purchases to government and NGO entities.  The equipment 
recipients are the National Dangerous Drugs Control 
Board (NDDCB) from 1993 to 1996; The Federation of Non- 
Governmental Organization Against Drug Abuse (FONGOADA) 
in 1995 and 1997; the Sri Lanka Anti-Narcotics 
Association (SLANA) in both 1998 and 1999; and the 
Mithuru-Mithuro Rehabilitation Center in 1999.  The 
details of each program's equipment and usage monitoring 
are outlined below.

¶B.  Procedures:  Post monitors resources through 
periodic communication and on-site inspections by 
Mission officers.  Through the relationship developed 
with the NDDCB personnel, this procedure has proven 
effective over time.  Post visually inspected the 
equipment last in January 2001.  Mission personnel have 
continued to receive verbal updates from NDDCB, the most 
recent being in early 2003.  Further, Post will be 
scheduling an on-site inspection in the coming months. 
 
¶C.  Status:  The NDDCB office in Colombo houses the 
equipment and all equipment was in satisfactory 
condition when last inspected. 
 
¶D.  Problems:  During the last communication, NDDCB 
personnel indicated that all equipment was in working 
order, with no outstanding problems. 
 
¶E.  Program Changes:  No program changes are 
recommended. 
 
¶F.  Impact:  The equipment supports the analytical work 
of the NDDCB's National Narcotics Laboratory (NNL), which 
conducts analysis of the Narcotic Drugs and other 
psychotropic substances.  The agency provides analytical 
reports of suspected narcotics samples forwarded by the 
government for examination.  The audio/visual equipment 
supports the NDDCB training division's awareness 
building, preventative education, and training programs.

fashion:  as an office resource and for loan to its

equipment is maintained properly.  The facsimile and 
answering machine are used as intended, while the video 
cassette recorder is used when the organization is able 
to borrow a television.

slide projector is no longer functional.  Need for such 
technology has declined and the slide projector's use 
not essential, however.

recommended. 
 
¶F.  Impact:  The equipment is part of a resource bank
