SUBJECT:  CONVEYING U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT LIBYAN WMD 
DEVELOPMENT POST UN SANCTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 282619 
 
(U) Classified by CDA Richard Albright for reasons 1.5 (b) 
and (d). 
 
¶1. (S) On October 14, Charge delivered reftel demarche on 
USG concerns about Libyan WMD development after the lifting 
of UN sanctions to MFA Assistant Undersecretary for 
Political Affairs Abdullah Rashid Al-Noaimi.  Al-Noaimi said 
that the UAEG's views about Libya had not changed after the 
lifting of UN sanctions.  The UAEG encourages Libya to 
"behave," but the Libyans haven't changed.  He said that 
"they are crazy, but we have to deal with them," and that 
the UAE is lucky that Libya is not a neighbor. 
 
¶2. (C) Al-Noaimi said that the UAE is going to send an 
Ambassador to Libya after the position had been vacant for a 
long time.  However, he added that this was unrelated to the 
lifting of UN sanctions.  Rather it was in response to Libya 
having sent an Ambassador to Abu Dhabi.  He commented that 
MFA staff were not lining up to serve in Libya
