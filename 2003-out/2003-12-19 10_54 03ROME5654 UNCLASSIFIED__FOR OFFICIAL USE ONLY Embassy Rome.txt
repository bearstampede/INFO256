SUBJECT: ALITALIA PROTESTS CUSTOMS PNR SANCTION 
 
    ¶1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  SEE PARAGRAPH 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) EMBASSY HAS RECEIVED A COPY OF A LETTER SENT FROM 
ALITALIA TO THE U.S. CUSTOMS SERVICE AT KENNEDY AIRPORT IN 
NEW YORK WITH CC TO DHS SECRETARY TOM RIDGE, POLITELY 
PROTESTING A U.S. CUSTOMS FINE OF $75,000 FOR 87 PNR DATA 
TRANSMISSION ERRORS.  ACCORDING TO THE LETTER, THE NAMES IN 
QUESTION WERE THOSE OF THE 87 MEMBERS OF THE ITALIAN NAVY 
TRAVELLING BAND WHO WERE GOING TO NEW YORK TO PARTICIPATE IN 
THE COLUMBUS DAY PARADE.  ALITALIA VICE PRESIDENT FOR 
REGULATORY AFFAIRS ORLANDO D'ORO SAYS THE BAND WAS INVITED TO 
THE EVENT BY BOTH THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK AND MAYOR OF NEW 
YORK CITY. 
 
¶3. (SBU) THE ALITALIA LETTER SAYS THAT THE INCIDENT WAS THE 
RESULT OF A NEW "GROUP CHECK-IN FUNCTION," AND ACCORDING TO 
THE VIOLATION, THE 87 BAND MEMBERS WERE CHECKED IN USING ONLY 
THEIR FIRST INITIALS AND NOT THEIR FULL FIRST NAMES. 
ALITALIA SAYS IT NOTICED THIS AND IMMEDIATELY FIXED THE 
PROBLEM WITH THE NEW SYSTEM, SO THAT AN INCIDENT OF THIS 
NATURE COULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. 
 
¶4. (SBU) THE LETTER STRESSES ALITALIA'S GOOD WILL AND 
CONSTRUCTIVE COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. IN THE FIELD OF 
SECURITY AND THE WAR ON TERRORISM.  EMBASSY CUSTOMS ATTACHE 
AND ECONOFFS NOTE THAT ALITALIA BEGAN PROVIDING PNR DATA 
EARLY AND SMOOTHLY, EVEN OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF ITALY'S 
NATIONAL PRIVACY AUTHORITY, AND BEFORE A FINAL EU DECISION ON 
THE LEGALITIES OF PROVIDING PNR DATA HAD BEEN REACHED. 
 
¶5. (U) ACTION REQUEST: EMBASSY REQUESTS DEPARTMENT ASSISTANCE 
    IN TRANSMITTING THIS MESSAGE TO U.S. CUSTOMS HEADQUARTERS AND 
RESOLVING THIS MATTER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THE CUSTOMS CASE 
NUMBER CITED IN THE LETTER IS 200-447-013-001-4301.  END 
ACTION REQUEST. 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT: UNLESS THERE IS MORE TO THIS CASE THAN THE 
LETTER CONTAINS, IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE IN OUR BEST INTEREST 
TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER PROMPTLY IN ALITALIA'S FAVOR, TO 
ENSURE ITS CONTINUED GOOD WILL AND COOPERATION WITH SUCH 
NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PNR 
DATA TRANSFER.  END COMMENT.
