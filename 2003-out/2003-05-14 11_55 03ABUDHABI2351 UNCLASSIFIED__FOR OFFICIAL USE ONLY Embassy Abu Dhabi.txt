(SBU) Charge delivered reftel points on reorganization 
of the Iraqi MFA, recall of Iraqi COM and disposition 
of Iraqi missions to MFA Assistant Under Secretary for 
Political Affairs, Abdullah Rashed al-Nuaimi on May 
Â¶14.  Recalling earlier discussions (refs B-E), 
Abdullah Rashed replied that the UAEG had not taken 
control of the Iraqi mission in the UAE as it had 
taken over supervision of the Rafidain Bank.  Noting 
that this was in interim period as far as legal 
authority in Iraq was concerned, he stated that the 
UAEG would like to have some reference for taking 
action with regard to Iraqi diplomatic facilities. 
Charge replied that the steps being requested had been 
communicated by the Iraqi MFA to Iraqi missions. 
Abdullah Rashed suggested that it would be helpful for 
the Iraqi MFA to communicate directly with host 
governments regarding status of Iraqi missions and 
noted that the UAE Embassy was functioning in Baghdad. 
Charge replied that we were communicating on behalf of 
the Iraqi MFA because it was constrained in its 
ability to communicate with governments after having 
instructed its diplomatic personnel abroad to cease 
all diplomatic and consular activities.  Abdullah 
Rashed undertook to study the request and get back to 
us.
