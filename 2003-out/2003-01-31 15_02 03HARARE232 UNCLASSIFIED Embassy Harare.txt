SUBJECT: INFORMATION MINISTER SAYS DAILY NEWS IS "ILLEGAL" 
 
 
  ¶1.   In the continuing legal battle between the Associated 
      Newspapers of Zimbabwe (ANZ), publishers of the independent 
      daily "The Daily News," and the government of Zimbabwe over 
      the mandatory registration of media houses and 
      accreditation of journalists under the controversial Access 
      to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA), 
      Information Minister Jonathan Moyo, in his opposing 
      affidavit filed in the Supreme Court this week, has accused 
      the newspaper of "operating illegally."  To date, the 
      newspaper has neither applied for registration nor 
      instructed its journalists to apply for accreditation at 
      the government-controlled Media and Information Commission. 
      ANZ filed an urgent application in the Supreme Court "to 
      declare invalid and devoid of legal effect, sections of the 
      Act which infringe on the rights of freedom of expression, 
      association and compulsory acquisition of property provided 
      for in the Constitution."  The Chairman of the Media and 
      Information Commission, Tafataona Mahoso, has also filed an 
      opposing affidavit in support of the Information Minister 
      Jonathan Moyo.  No date has been set for the hearing of the 
      matter. 
 
  ¶2.   Meanwhile two international news agencies, Reuters and 
      Agence France Press have obtained accreditation for their 
      bureaus and news staff in Zimbabwe.  They submitted their 
      fees in United States dollars, as demanded by the Media and 
      Information Commission.  The Associated Press (AP) declined 
      and closed its bureau, but retained two correspondents. 
      Zimbabwean correspondents for foreign media have been 
      advised by their lawyers that paying in American dollars 
      would violate exchange control regulations - which bar 
      Zimbabwe citizens and permanent residents from paying a 
      Zimbabwean body such as the Media Commission in foreign 
      currency.  The Media and Information Commission is yet to 
      decide on the way forward in terms of the payments issue. 
      Under AIPPA all those who have been refused accreditation 
      must cease practicing or risk being arrested.
