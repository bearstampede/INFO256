¶1. (U) Local press reported that after attending a 
meeting last week in Paris organized by a special 
committee affiliated with WHO and UNESCO to discuss 
human cloning, Ministry of Health Assistant 
Undersecretary for Curative Medicine Dr. Abdul Ghaffar 
Al-Hawi stated that the UAE would support a ban on all 
human cloning.  The UAE's position would extend the 
prohibition to all laboratory experiments related to 
genetic research. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Al-Hawi's public statement indicates 
that the UAEG should support the Costa Rican 
resolution in the UNGA, as the MFA told us in reftel. 
End comment.
