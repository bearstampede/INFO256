¶1. (U) This is an action request; please see paragraph 
       ¶4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientist Dr. 
David Ellis  made explicit allegations against Abu 
Dhabi Crown Prince Shaykh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan 
and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan 
bin Zayed Al Nahyan for involvement in falcon smuggling 
in a paper he presented at the World Working Group of 
Birds of Prey Conference in Hungary in May 2003. 
Secretary General of the Environmental Research and 
 
SIPDIS 
Wildlife Development Agency (ERWDA) Mejad Al Mansouri 
has inquired repeatedly of the Embassy if Dr. Ellis was 
presenting his own views at the Conference or speaking 
on behalf of the USG when he presented his paper. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We are unable to determine from available 
information whether his paper represented his personal 
opinion or USG views. In a conversation with the 
Charge, Mansouri alleged that the paper Dr. Ellis 
presented at the Conference had a Department of 
Interior logo.  However, on Dr. Ellis' website, the 
paper he delivered at the Conference appears to 
indicate that he is representing an Institute for 
Raptor Studies based in Oracle, Arizona.  We have been 
unable to obtain any information about this Institute. 
On the website devoted to the Conference, the abstract 
of Dr. Ellis' oral presentation cites his name and the 
USGS Southwest Biological Science Center, but then 
lists the address of the Institute and a personal email 
address. Post has not/ not contacted Dr. Ellis 
directly. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action request: Embassy Abu Dhabi would like 
to respond to the UAEG's inquiries and find out if Dr. 
Ellis was presenting his own opinions or speaking on 
behalf of the USG at the World Working Group of Birds 
of Prey Conference.  End Action request.
