¶2. Evrensel / Friction between the villagers 
and Gendarme still continues in Bozova, 
Urfa.  Villagers claim that gendarme 
collected about 10 boys from the village 
school and asked where the villagers keep 
their guns. When boys didn't answer they 
beat the boys.  Some boys claimed that 
their noses were broken after the incident. 
According to the newspaper the incident 
started on June 15 during a wedding 
ceremony. Gendarme heard the villagers 
firing their guns "for fun" during the 
ceremony. They came to the village and 
wanted the villagers to hand their guns in. 
Most of the guns were unauthorized. 
Villagers objected and extra gendarme 
forces came for support.  About 30 
villagers were taken to the nearest 
gendarme station.  Five of the villagers 
were arrested for keeping unauthorized guns 
and five of them were arrested for fighting 
with the gendarme.  On July 10 gendarme had

guns. Ahmet Faruk Onsal from AKP, and
