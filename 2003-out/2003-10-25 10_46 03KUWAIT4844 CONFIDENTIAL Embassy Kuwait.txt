(C) In a meeting October 22 with MFA Undersecretary Khaled 
Al-Jarallah, Ambassador reiterated the USG desire to see 
rapid progress on the Article 98 agreement with Kuwait. 
Ambassador asked Al-Jarallah when the GOK intends to present 
the agreement to the National Assembly for ratification (as 
the GOK deems necessary) and how long the process is likely 
to take.  Al-Jarallah informed that the GOK plans to present 
the Article 98 agreement along with several other 
international agreements to the National Assembly within the 
next two months for ratification (i.e., post-Ramadan). 
Ambassador stressed that final USG approval of Major Non-Nato 
Ally status for Kuwait could be influenced by GOK movement on 
this issue.
