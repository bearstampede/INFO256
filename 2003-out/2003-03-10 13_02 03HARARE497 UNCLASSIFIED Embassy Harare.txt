SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT: PRESIDENT BUSH SANCTIONS MUGABE 
GOVERNMENT; HARARE 
 
 
Two mainstream newspapers have carried articles reporting 
on President George W. Bush's March 7, 2003 executive order 
imposing financial sanctions on 77 individuals linked to 
President Mugabe's government.  The independent weekly "The 
Standard" broke the story in the March 9 edition.  The 
paper carried the article on page two under headline "U. S. 
Freezes Mugabe and cronies' assets.  The March 10 edition 
of the pro-government "Daily Mirror" picked up a Reuters 
article and published it on page two under headline "U. S. 
sanctions are racist, says govt official."  The name of the 
quoted Government of Zimbabwe official was not revealed in 
the article.  So far the government-controlled print and 
electronic media appear to have ignored the story. 
However, Post will continue to monitor the media for 
additional placements or editorial commentaries and will 
report accordingly.
