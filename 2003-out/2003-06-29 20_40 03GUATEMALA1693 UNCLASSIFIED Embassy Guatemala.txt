SUBJECT: SAIA INTERNAL REGULATIONS SIGNED BY MINISTER OF 
GOVERNMENT 
 
¶1.  Minister of Government Jose Adolfo Reyes Calderon told 
the Ambassador on June 27 that he had signed the global 
internal regulations of the SAIA (Guatemala's 
counter-narcotics police).  These new internal regulations, 
which were drafted in consultation with the Embassy, 
represent a major step in the reorganization of Guatemala's 
counter-drug police after the dissolution of the DOAN in 2002. 
 
¶2.  By signing the SAIA internal regulations, the GOG has 
complied with an important benchmark in our counternatcotics 
certification dialogue.
