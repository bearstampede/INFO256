HOLY SEE BEHIND ROAD MAP 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. (C) MEETING JULY 17 AT THE VATICAN WITH ACTING FM 
MONSIGNOR PIETRO PAROLIN AND IN ROME WITH SANT' EGIDIO 
COMMUNITY LEADERS, A/S JONES EMPHASIZED THAT SECRETARY POWELL 
DEPENDED ON THE HOLY SEE'S MORAL AUTHORITY TO HELP PRODUCE 
RESULTS IN KEY AREAS SUCH AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND IRAQ, AS 
WELL AS ON GLOBAL ISSUES SUCH AS HIV/AIDS, TRAFFICKING IN 
    PERSONS, AND BIOTECH FOODS.  PAROLIN COMMENTED THAT SECRETARY 
POWELL'S JUNE 2 MEETING WITH THE POPE AND SECRETARY OF STATE 
SODANO HAD BEEN "FRUITFUL" AND MUCH APPRECIATED IN THE 
VATICAN. 
 
¶3. (C) SINCE THE SECRETARY'S DISCUSSIONS ON THE SITUATION IN 
THE MIDDLE EAST, A/S JONES NOTED THAT MUCH HAD BEEN DONE TO 
MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD.  WITH ABU MAZEN BEING INVITED TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE, FOLLOWED BY A VISIT BY PM SHARON, A JOINT 
MEETING BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS, AND SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS IN 
EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA, JONES OBSERVED THAT THERE WAS SOME 
MOMENTUM BEHIND THE PEACE PROCESS.  TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THIS, ABU MAZEN NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO SHOW RESULTS TO SHORE UP 
HIS POSITION INTERNALLY.  SHE EMPHASIZED THAT THE SECRETARY 
WAS LOOKING TO THE HOLY SEE TO HELP BUILD UP ABU MAZEN SO HE 
HAS THE AUTHORITY HE NEEDS TO MAKE AGREEMENTS WITH SHARON FOR 
PEACE.  PAROLIN INDICATED THAT HE HAD RECENTLY MET WITH 
ISRAELI FM SILVAN SHALOM AND HAD EMPHASIZED TWO POINTS:  THE 
HOLY SEE'S SUPPORT FOR THE ROAD MAP AND THE NEED TO BUILD A 
CONFIDENT ATMOSPHERE BETWEEN THE PARTIES.  IN THIS REGARD, 
THE HOLY SEE HAD APPEALED TO THE ISRAELIS TO "REFRAIN FROM 
RETALIATION" IN ORDER TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE. 
SHALOM'S RESPONSE WAS SIMPLY TO REITERATE THAT "SECURITY IS 
VERY IMPORTANT TO US." 
 
¶4. (C) SANT' EGIDIO'S LEADERSHIP TOLD A/S JONES THAT THEY HAD 
JUST RETURNED FROM THE MIDDLE EAST, WHERE THEY HAD MET WITH 
BOTH ABU MAZEN AND SHARON.  SANT' EGIDIO'S BETTI LAMENTED 
THAT CATHOLIC PALESTINIAN PATRIARCH MICHAEL SABBAH WAS NOT 
YET BEHIND ABU MAZEN, BUT SAID THEY HAD ENCOURAGED HIM TO 
EMBRACE MAZEN, WHO, UNLIKE ARAFAT, CAN DELIVER ON HIS 
    PROIF2FQGQOQL.AGC%QJQY+~XL&#}FQZ^QFI"QQ/4JQME 4QQQQA9Q&@ENUCXQ|I4ZSNWQW `NQXQ{]+\XQ":#3Q}UU=Q"QA8D]Q/\Q`S%PZVKQU8MK*. >Q-Q|`Q#------------- 
FOCUS ON AFRICA:  HIV/AIDS AND BIOTECH FOODS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) A/S JONES REVIEWED FOR PAROLIN AND SANT' EGIDIO THE 
PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO AFRICA, NOTING THAT IT HAD GENERATED 
GREATER INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION FOR U.S. EFFORTS TO MEET THE 
CHALLENGE OF HIV/AIDS AND TO USE THE PROMISE OF BIOTECH FOODS 
TO MEET THE CONTINENT'S NUTRITION NEEDS.  JONES EMPHASIZED 
THAT AFRICA HAS BEEN A CONTINUING PRIORITY FOR THE PRESIDENT, 
WHO RECOGNIZED EARLY ON THAT HIV/AIDS WAS WIPING OUT WHOLE 
GENERATIONS OF TEACHERS, FARMERS, HEALTH WORKERS AND OTHER 
KEY SECTORS OF PEOPLE ESSENTIAL TO AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT. 
PAROLIN WELCOMED THIS ATTENTION, OBSERVING THAT THE HOLY SEE 
VIEWS AFRICA AS A "FORGOTTEN CONTINENT" AND CONTINUES TO 
ADVOCATE FOR GREATER INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT.  FOR ITS PART, 
THE HOLY SEE HAS INTENSIFIED ITS COLLABORATION WITH THE UN ON 
AFRICA FOLLOWING A FEBRUARY MEETING BETWEEN KOFI ANNAN AND 
THE POPE.  SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE VATICAN'S 
DICASTRIES (MINISTRY EQUIVALENTS) ARE MEETING NOW TO DEVELOP 
SPECIFIC INITIATIVES FOR THIS NEW COLLABORATION, PAROLIN 
INDICATED. 
 
¶8. (SBU) REGARDING BIOTECH FOODS, PAROLIN TOLD A/S JONES THAT 
THE HOLY SEE WAS "BUILDING A POSITION" AND HOPED TO BE ABLE 
TO ARRIVE AT A CLEAR VIEW THAT COULD BE SHARED WITH BISHOPS 
    AND NUNCIOS.  FOR THE TIME BEING, HE SAID THE HOLY SEE WAS 
"NOT AGAINST, AND NOT IN FAVOR."  AT THE SAME TIME, THE 
VATICAN RECOGNIZED THE MORAL IMPORTANCE OF FEEDING THE 
HUNGRY, AND WAS CONSIDERING AN INTERIM POSITION THAT WOULD 
EMPHASIZE THE SAFETY OF FOODS FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION, WHILE 
RESERVING JUDGMENT ON AGRICULTURAL USES UNTIL THEY HAD 
EXAMINED THE ISSUE MORE CLOSELY.  A/S JONES SAID THE U.S. HAS 
FOCUSED ON BIOTECH FOODS IN TERMS OF THE BENEFITS THEY COULD 
BRING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE.  SHE ADDED THAT 
WE "CAN'T IMAGINE WHY SUCH FOOD SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO 
PEOPLE WHO WANT IT, AND WHY SUCH TECHNOLOGY SHOULD NOT BE 
AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO WANT TO GROW BIOTECH CROPS."  PAROLIN 
SAID IT APPEARED TO THE HOLY SEE THAT THE EU WAS SOFTENING 
ITS POSITION, AND A/S JONES SAID WE WERE PRESSING THE EU TO 
EASE UP ON ITS RESTRICTIONS.  AMBASSADOR NICHOLSON EMPHASIZED 
THAT THE KEY QUESTION THAT ALL PARTIES NEEDED TO REFLECT ON 
WAS WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM DYING OF 
HUNGER AND MALNUTRITION-RELATED DISEASE. 
 
¶9. (SBU) A/S JONES EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE HOLY SEE'S 
AND SANT' EGIDIO'S ONGOING WORK TO PREVENT AND TREAT 
HIV/AIDS.  SANT' EGIDIO'S BETTI OUTLINED THE COMMUNITY'S 
ANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENT PROGRAM IN MOZAMBIQUE, WHICH HE 
EMPHASIZED WAS EXACTLY IN LINE WITH THE PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY 
FUND GOALS.  HE WELCOMED RECENT INDICATIONS OF SUPPORT THAT 
SANT' EGIDIO HAD RECEIVED FOR THE PROJECT FROM HHS SECRETARY 
TOMMY THOMPSON AND U/S DOBRIANSKY DURING RECENT MEETINGS. 
BETTI CAUTIONED THAT THE U.S. WAS LIKELY TO RUN INTO A STRONG 
HEADWIND FROM MANY RECIPIENT COUNTRIES, WHO WILL WANT TO USE 
THE NEW FUND FOR EVERYTHING EXCEPT TREATMENT -- WHICH THEY 
CONSIDER TOO EXPENSIVE.  RECOGNIZING THIS ISSUE, HOWEVER, 
    BETTI POINTED OUT THAT HIV/AIDS SHOULD BE SEEN NOT ONLY AS A 
PROBLEM, BUT ALSO AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESHAPE AFRICAN HEALTH 
SYSTEMS.  BETTI INFORMED A/S JONES THAT SANT' EGIDIO WAS 
PREPARING A CONFERENCE AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY THIS FALL 
AIMED AT BUILDING SUPPORT FOR THE MEDICAL CASE FOR TREATMENT 
AND EXPLORING BEST WAYS TO APPROACH THIS TASK.  JONES 
WELCOMED SANT' EGIDIO'S INITIATIVE, AND URGED THAT THE

DINATOR RANDALL TOBIAS. 
 SHE PLEDGED TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY WITH INFORMATION ON HOW 
BEST TO LINK UP WITH TOBIAS. 
 
---------------------- 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS 
---------------------- 

¶10.  (SBU) POINTING OUT THAT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS WAS BOTH 
A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE AND ONE OF BORDER SECURITY, A/S JONES 
REVIEWED U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THIS 
SCOURGE, INCLUDING THE PRODUCTIVE FOCUS DURING THE DUTCH OSCE 
PRESIDENCY.  PAROLIN EMPHASIZED THE VATICAN'S SUPPORT FOR 
ANTI-TRAFFICKING INITIATIVES, NOTING THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY 
ENGAGED WITH THE COUNCIL FOR EUROPE, WHICH IS ESTABLISHING A 
WORKING GROUP TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE.  PAROLIN INDICATED THAT 
THE VATICAN WAS LIKELY TO APPOINT A WOMAN TO HEAD THEIR 
DELEGATION AS A SIGN OF THEIR RECOGNITION OF THE 
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT TRAFFICKING HAS ON WOMEN.

TURKEY AND THE EU:  OVERCOMING RELIGIOUS RESTRICTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶11. (C) RESPONDING TO A RECENT STATEMENT FROM THE HOLY SEE'S 
FOREIGN MINISTER THAT WAS SEEN AS RAISING DOUBTS ABOUT 
TURKEY'S FITNESS FOR EU MEMBERSHIP, A/S JONES SAID THE U.S. 
VIEWED TURKEY AS WANTING A EUROPEAN FUTURE.  THE NEW 
GOVERNMENT HAD GIVEN PRIORITY TO PASSING NEW LEGISLATION THAT 
WILL ALLOW TURKEY TO MEET EU CRITERIA, SHE POINTED OUT, AND 
THE CHALLENGE NOW WAS TO ENSURE IMPLEMENTATION.  HERE, TOO, 
SHE NOTED, WE HAD SEEN TURKEY TAKE POSITIVE STEPS.  PAROLIN 
ASKED WHETHER THE U.S. WAS CONVINCED TURKEY WANTS TO BE IN 
THE EU, OBSERVING THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD HEARD SUGGESTIONS 
THAT THIS WAS A "FACADE."  JONES SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD 
SUCH A SUGGESTION AND THAT ALL THE INDICATIONS WE HAD FROM 
TURKEY REFLECTED A GENUINE COMMITMENT TO EU MEMBERSHIP. 
PAROLIN AFFIRMED THE HOLY SEE'S POSITION THAT THE 
    INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY "MUST HELP TURKEY," AND STRESSED THAT 
THE VATICAN WAS "NOT AGAINST TURKEY'S ENTRY TO THE EU." 
NEVERTHELESS, THEY BELIEVED TURKEY HAD TO MEET THE EU'S 
CRITERIA ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND IMPLEMENT 
THEM.  "SO FAR," HE ADDED, " THE STEPS TAKEN ARE NOT ENOUGH." 
 A/S JONES ASKED PAROLIN WHETHER THE HOLY SEE HAD A GOOD 
DIALOGUE WITH TURKEY ON THESE ISSUES.  HE RESPONDED THAT 
THERE WAS A GOOD DIALOGUE, IN WHICH THE HOLY SEE HAD INVOLVED 
EU MEMBERS, BUT THAT TURKEY HAD REACTED NEGATIVELY ON KEY 
ISSUES.  SPECIFICALLY, PAROLIN NOTED THAT THE CHURCH HAD NO 
JURIDICAL STANDING, AND WAS NOT ALLOWED TO OWN PROPERTY. 
WHILE THERE IS FREEDOM OF WORSHIP, TURKEY DOES NOT ALLOW FOR 
FREE RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION IN PUBLIC.  A/S JONES ENCOURAGED 
THE HOLY SEE TO CONTINUE TO PRESS THEIR CONCERNS, POINTING 
OUT THAT WE, TOO, OFTEN HAD TO OVERCOME NEGATIVE TURKISH 
REACTIONS BEFORE MAKING PROGRESS. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
RUSSIA:  SITUATION IMPROVING DESPITE HASSLES 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶12. (C) ASKED ABOUT THE SITUATION FOR CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN 
RUSSIA THAT HAD PROVOKED A PAPAL LETTER TO PRESIDENT PUTIN 
LAST YEAR, PAROLIN INDICATED THAT THE SITUATION WAS MUCH 
IMPROVED.  RUSSIA IS NOW WILLING TO RECEIVE THE PRIESTS AND 
ALLOW THEM TO WORK.  THE OUTSTANDING PROBLEM IS THE SHORT 
LENGTH OF THE VISAS ISSUED TO THE PRIESTS -- THREE MONTHS -- 
WHICH THE HOLY SEE REGARDS AS GRATUITOUS BUREAUCRATIC 
HASSLING THAT REQUIRES PRIESTS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY ONCE 
EVERY THREE MONTHS.  THEY ARE IN DISCUSSION WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, AND BELIEVE THEIR NEW 
    NUNCIO IN MOSCOW HAS MADE PROGRESS IN BUILDING A CONSTRUCTIVE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES.  THE RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH, ON THE OTHER HAND, REMAINS 
DIFFICULT.  THE RUSSIAN PATRIARCH'S ILL HEALTH HAS ALSO MADE 
PROGRESS DIFFICULT, AS THE CHURCH IS CURRENTLY IN A HOLDING 
PATTERN IN ITS DIALOGUE WITH THE HOLY SEE.  A/S JONES NOTED 
THAT WE HAVE RAISED HOLY SEE CONCERNS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
ISSUES AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL AND WOULD BE WILLING TO DO SO 
IN THE FUTURE IF NECESSARY.  PAROLIN WELCOMED THIS 
COMMITMENT, AND AGREED TO KEEP THE U.S. APPRISED OF PROGRESS.

ROMA/SINTI:  A BLOT ON EUROPE'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶13. (SBU) SANT' EGIDIO OUTLINED TO A/S JONES ITS DECADES-LONG 
ENGAGEMENT ON BEHALF OF ROMA AND SINTI, PARTICULARLY IN 
ITALY.  CLAUDIO BETTI SAID THAT ITALY'S TREATMENT OF ITS ROMA 
COMMUNITY REPRESENTED A MAJOR HUMAN RIGHTS EMBARRASSMENT, ONE 
IT SHARED WITH OTHER WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  HE NOTED 
THAT ITALY'S ROMA AND SINTI LIVE WITHOUT WATER AND 
SANITATION, THEIR CHILDREN DO NOT ATTEND SCHOOL, AND THEY ARE 
 
VATICAN 00003387  004 OF 004 
 
I URGED THE U.S. TO 
ENGAGE ITS EUROPEAN PARTNERS ON BEHALF OF THE ROMA AND SINTI, 
CALL ATTENTION TO THIS HUMAN RIGHTS GAP, AND ENCOURAGE THE 
EUROPEANS TO ADOPT NEW LAWS AND MEASURES TO OVERCOME THE 
CURRENT DESPERATE SITUATION FOR THE ROMA IN ITALY AND 
ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE.
