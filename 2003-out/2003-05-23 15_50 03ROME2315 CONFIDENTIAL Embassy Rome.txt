TAGS: PREL MARR MOPS GR IT NATO
SUBJECT: ITALIAN MOD ON NATO COMMAND STRUCTURE 
 
REF: ATHENS 1723 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: A/DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 
1.5(B), (D) 
 
¶1. (C)  ITALIAN DEFENSE MINISTER ANTONIO MARTINO IS ADAMANT 
THAT ANY NATO COMMAND STRUCTURING PLANS SHOULD MAKE SENSE 
BOTH ECONOMICALLY AND OPERATIONALLY, ACCORDING TO FRANCESCO 
TRUPIANO, MARTINO'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR.  DURING A MAY 23 
DISCUSSION ON OTHER MATTERS, TRUPIANO TOLD POL-MIL COUNSELOR 
THAT MARTINO HAD AGREED TO THE PROPOSAL TO MOVE AIRSOUTH FROM 
ITALY TO TURKEY BECAUSE OF HIGH-LEVEL USG REQUESTS TO HIM 
PERSONALLY, EVEN THOUGH HE COULD NOT SEE THE OPERATIONAL OR 
ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE MOVE.  IT WAS A "PAINFUL" CONCESSION, 
TRUPIANO SAID, THAT RAN COUNTER TO ITALY'S NATIONAL INTERESTS 
AND MARTINO'S CONSERVATIVE (U. OF CHICAGO) ECONOMICS 
TRAINING.  MARTINO WOULD NOT BE AS SUPPORTIVE OF OTHER 
COMMAND STRUCTURING PROPOSALS THAT MADE LITTLE MILITARY, 
ECONOMIC OR OPERATIONAL SENSE, TRUPIANO SAID. 
 
¶2. (C)  FOR THAT REASON, MARTINO OPPOSES THE IDEA OF 
RELOCATING ITALY'S ONLY COMBINED AIR COMMAND CENTER (CAOC) TO 
SPAIN, TRUPIANO SAID.  AS CURRENTLY CONFIGURED, THE CAOC 
GIVES HUNGARY AND ITALY STRATEGIC COVERAGE OF THE BALKANS 
FROM TWO ANGLES.  THIS ADVANTAGE WOULD BE LOST BY A MOVE WEST 
TO SPAIN, TRUPIANO EXPLAINED. 
 
¶3. (C) ITALY ALSO SEES NO BENEFIT FROM A CAOC IN GREECE, 
WHICH WOULD IN EFFECT GIVE GREECE OPERATIONAL CONTROL OVER 
TURKISH AIRSPACE.  THIS WOULD NOT BE OFFSET BY MOVING 
    AIRSOUTH TO TURKEY BECAUSE AIRSOUTH CONSISTS OF A COMMAND 
STRUCTURE WITH LITTLE OPERATIONAL EFFECT, ACCORDING TO 
TRUPIANO.  GREECE WOULD STILL HAVE CONTROL OVER TURKISH 
AIRSPACE, WHICH MIGHT WELL PROMPT TURKEY TO INSIST ON HAVING 
A CAOC OF ITS OWN. 
 
¶4. (C) COMMENT.  WHILE HE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY RAISE GREECE'S 
PROPOSAL (REFTEL) TO MOVE NAVSOUTH FROM NAPLES TO GREECE (AND 
NEITHER DID WE), TRUPIANO DID REMARK THAT, AFTER ITALY'S 
COOPERATION ON THE AIRSOUTH MOVE, THE GOI WOULD STRONGLY 
OPPOSE ANY OTHER PROPOSALS THAT WOULD FURTHER DIMINISH NATO'S 
PRESENCE IN ITALY.  END COMMENT.
