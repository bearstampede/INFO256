SUBJECT: HONDURAS REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO OPERATION IRAQI 
FREEDOM DESPITE RECENT MORTAR ATTACKS 
 
REF: CUMMINS-KELLY EMAIL 12/3/03 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Larry L. Palmer; 
Reasons 1.5 (A), (B) and (D). 
 
¶1. (C) During the early morning of December 3, the Honduran 
contingent in Iraq (Task Force Xatruch) was attacked by four 
mortar shells.  No injuries or damage was reported.  Initial 
reports indicated that all four shells impacted outside the 
Honduran compound (Ref A), although MOD Federico Breve later 
told MILGRP Commander that two shells apparently did land 
inside the compound, one between two barracks. 
 
¶2. (U) According to press accounts, despite the attacks, 
President Maduro reaffirmed November 3, that Honduras would 
not be deterred from continuing to provide troops in support 
of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Maduro cited Honduras' long 
standing alliance with the U.S., its commitments as a UN 
member, and Honduras' moral obligation to contribute to 
peacekeeping missions among the reasons to stay the course in 
Iraq.  Maduro assured the Honduran people that the Government 
of Honduras (GOH) would continue to monitor the situation and 
do all it could to provide for the troop's safety.  However, 
Maduro stated that the mission did involve certain risks that 
Honduras was prepared to take. 
 
¶3. (C) While the GOH downplayed the incident to the press, 
privately MOD Breve expressed relief to MILGRP Commander that 
the attacks produced no casualties, stating the GOH could 
face sustainment problems if Honduran troops were targeted. 
(Comment:  Concerns remain that a determined attack against 
the Honduran compound could easily produce casualties.  If 
this were to occur, there would be intense pressure on Maduro 
to withdrawal Honduran troops from Iraq. End Comment). 
 
¶4. (U) Minimize considered.
