SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  SHARM AL SHEIKH SUMMIT 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  ALL UAE PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA DEVOTED 
EXTENSIVE COVERAGE TO THE SHARM AL SHEIKH SUMMIT AND CARRIED 
PRESIDENT BUSH'S STATEMENTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY.  AN "AL KHALEEJ" 
EDITORIAL WARNED ARAB LEADERS OF FURTHER CONCESSIONS AND ASSERTED 
THAT THE MAIN AIM BEHIND PRESIDENT BUSH'S STATEMENTS ARE TO END 
PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE.  AN "AL BAYAN" EDITORIAL CLAIMED THAT THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ROADMAP REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT TEST FOR 
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. 
 
¶2.  CLAIMING THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ROADMAP REPRESENTS A 
REAL TEST FOR THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS- 
ORIENTED ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 6/04: 
 
"... THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT REPRESENTS 
A CHANGE IN THE U.S. VISION OF MIDDLE EAST ISSUES, AND WE HOPE 
THAT THESE STATEMENTS WILL BECOME ACTS ... THE ROADMAP IS A REAL 
TEST, NOT FOR THE ZIONISTS WHO MMAKE PROMISES AND STATEMENTS ON 
PEACE THAT WE DON'T TRUST, BUT FOR THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION 
WHO WE FEAR WILL IGNORE THEIR OWN PROMISES (WHICH WE ARE USED 
TO), ESPECIALLY AS THE AMERICAN ELECTIONS ARE VERY SOON." 
 
¶3.  WARNING ARAB LEADERS OF FURTHER CONCESSIONS AND ASSERTING 
THAT ENDING THE PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE IS PRESIDENT BUSH'S 
PRIMARY GOAL AT THE SHARM AL SHEIKH SUMMIT, SHARJAH-BASED PAN- 
ARAB DAILY "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 6/04: 
 
"THE SHARM AL SHEIKH SUMMIT WAS VERY FAST, AND SO WAS THE ARAB 
LEADERS ACCEPTANCE OF AMERICAN PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S VISION 
REGARDING TERRORISM, VIOLENCE, AND EXTREMISM 'IN ANY WAY, FROM 
ANY SOURCE, OR FROM ANYWHERE REGARDLESS OF THE EXCUSES AND 
MOTIVES,' SOMETHING THE ARAB LEADERS DID NOT SAY ... PRESIDENT 
BUSH EXPLAINED IT PERSONALLY, STATING THAT THEY (ARAB LEADERS) 
SHOULD HELP THE PALESTINIAN ADMINISTRATION IN ITS WAR AGAINST 
TERRORISM.  AND BY TERRORISM, HERE IS THE PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE 
..."
