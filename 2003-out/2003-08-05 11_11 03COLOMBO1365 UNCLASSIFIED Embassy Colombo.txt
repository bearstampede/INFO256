The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) is seeking a third 
party to invest in the petroleum market.  Presently the 
market is held by Ceypetco (State owned Corporation) 
and Lanka Indian Oil Corporation.  The third party will 
take over 100 filling stations and a one-third stake in 
the common petroleum infrastructure facility that is to 
be floated.  All three players will hold equal shares 
in this new common facility that will include all 
storage tanks, depots and distribution infrastructure.
