¶1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 3. 
 
 
¶2. (C) MFA Iraq Department Head Serra Erslan telephoned us 
August 20 to report that the MFA had received reports that 
the Iranians recently had opened consulates in two cities in 
northern Iraq -- Irbil and Suleymaniye.  Erslan said that up 
until recently, the Iranians had trade offices and/or other 
non-diplomatic presence in Irbil and Suleymaniye.  Now the 
Iranians were hanging signs outside of the buildings 
identifying them as consulates.  Erslan requested the 
Embassy's assistance in confirming the accuracy of these 
reports.  She noted that GOT remained interested in 
re-establishing a diplomatic presence in the north, but 
continued to operate under the belief that the US position 
remained the "timing is not right." 
 
 
¶3. (C) Action request: Embassy requests the Department 
confirm whether Iran has opened consulates in Irbil and/or 
Suleymaniye, as well as clarification of the US position on 
opening diplomatic missions in northern Iraq.
