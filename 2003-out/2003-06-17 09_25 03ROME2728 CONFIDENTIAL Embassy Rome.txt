CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING POL MC JOHN BASS FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (C) ON JUNE 12, LUIGI MACCOTTA, THE MFA'S OFFICE DIRECTOR 
FOR IRAQ, ASKED TO MEET WITH POL NEA WATCHER TO DISCUSS THE 
COST OF MAINTAINING THE TWO "IRAQI" WARSHIPS KEPT IN THE 
ITALIAN PORT OF LA SPEZIA. (NOTE: IN THE MID-1980S, 
FINCANTIERI, A GOI-CONTROLLED SHIPYARD COMPANY, BUILT FOUR 
LUPO FRIGATES (SMALL WARSHIPS) FOR THE SADDAM GOVERNMENT. 
THESE FRIGATES WERE NEVER DELIVERED BECAUSE OF THE IRAQ/IRAN 
WAR AND THEN THE UN EMBARGO (REF A).  TWO OF THESE FRIGATES, 
PARTIALLY PAID FOR BY THE IRAQIS, REMAIN AT LA SPEZIA.  POST 
HAS NO INFORMATION ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE OTHER TWO SHIPS. 
 END NOTE).  THE COST OF MAINTAINING THESE TWO SHIPS, 
ACCORDING TO MACCOTTA, IS $2 MILLION/YEAR, WHICH THE GOI HAS 
BEEN PAYING SO FAR. 
 
¶2. (C) SINCE THE GOI DOES NOT WISH TO CONTINUE TO PAY FOR THE 
MAINTENANCE OF THESE IRAQI SHIPS, SAID MACCOTTA, THE MFA 
SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL FOR POLITICAL APPROVAL BY WHICH ITALY 
WOULD USE FROZEN IRAQI ASSETS TO PAY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF 
THE FRIGATES, AS WELL AS THE EXPENSES OF THE IRAQI INTEREST 
SECTION IN ROME, IN ACCORDANCE WITH UN RESOLUTION 1483, 
PARAGRAPH 23, SECTION B.  MACCOTTA EXPECTED THIS PROPOSAL TO 
BE APPROVED AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL SOON. 
 
¶3. (C) ON THE TOPIC OF IRAQI CHIEFS OF MISSION RETURNING TO 
THE MFA IN BAGHDAD (REF B), MACCOTTA SAID THAT THE IRAQI 
CHARGE D'AFFAIRES IN ITALY, FARIS ALI AL SHOKER, HAS NOT BEEN 
    ASKED TO RETURN TO THE IRAQI MFA (CONFIRMED BY REF C) SINCE 
HE IS ONLY A FIRST SECRETARY AND IS NOT A CHIEF OF MISSION. 
MACCOTTA SAID THAT AL SHOKER IS NOT "ONE OF THE BAD GUYS." 
THE PLAN, SAID MACCOTTA, WOULD BE FOR THE GOI TO RELEASE 
FUNDS FROM THE IRAQI FROZEN ASSETS TO AL SHOKER, WHO WOULD IN 
TURN PAY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SHIPS AND THE EXPENSES OF THE 
IRAQI INTEREST SECTION IN ROME.
