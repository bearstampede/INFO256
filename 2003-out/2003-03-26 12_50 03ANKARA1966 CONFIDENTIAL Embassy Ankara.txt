SUBJECT: TFIZ01: TGS CHIEF OF STAFF ISSUES STATEMENT ON TU 
PRESENCE IN NORTHERN IRAQ 
 
 
(u) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: 
1.5 (B and D) 
 
 
¶1. (C) On March 26, Turkish General Staff CHOD General Hilmi 
Ozkok issued a public statement on the current presence of TU 
forces in northern Iraq and future Turkish intentions in the 
region. 
 
 
¶2. (U) Following are excerpts of the statement (a complete 
English-language text will follow septel): 
 
 
--Certain elements of the Turkish Armed Forces are currently 
in northern Iraq; 
 
 
--Turkish forces are not planning to intervene in the region 
unless there is an attack against Turkish forces there, 
unless there is a refugee influx, unless one of the groups in 
the region attacks the other, or unless the civilian 
population is attacked. 
 
 
--Turkish forces are not planning to send additional forces 
to northern Iraq; 
 
 
--The United States is currently waging a war in the region, 
and when we (the Turks) send units there (northern Iraq), 
coordination will be conducted; 
 
 
--Turkish forces do not intend to fight or to invade; 
 
 
--Turkish forces are not there (northern Iraq) permanently; 
and, 
 
 
--Turkish forces will not engage in clashes in the region 
other than in order to defend themselves. 
 
 
¶3. (U) Ozkok also expressed concern about what he described 
as the "suspicious 
attitudes" of certain institutions, international 
organizations, and certain allied countries regarding 
Turkey's position, including criticism leveled by foreign 
countries who feel threatened by the efforts of the Turkish 
forces, who are making preparations because of the 
developments in northern Iraq. 
 
 
¶4. (C) Comment:  Ozkok's statement stands on its own. 
Seeking further elaboration at this time could expose 
divisions within TGS or with the GOT.  We recommend that the 
USG refrain from asking the Turks to elaborate on Ozkok's 
statement before SPE Khalilzad returns to Ankara for his 
March 29 meetings with the Turks. 
 
 
¶5. (U) Amb. Khalilzad has cleared this message.
