Â¶1.  (C) Acting DCM made reftel demarche November 22 on MFA 
Deputy Director of International Organizations Department, 
Amb. Aqeel Behbehani, along with Italian DCM representing the 
EU Presidency.  The Italian's demarche did not include the 
specific concerns about the new laws on Public Associations 
and Religion, so Pol Chief conveyed those orally.  Behbehani 
promised to convey this demarche to his superiors, but stated 
that Kuwait's provisional position was to abstain, in line 
with Arab and Islamic consensus.
