SUBJECT: JIU REPORT ON FAO: AN AGENDA FOR CHANGE 
 
REF:  A) ROME 02589, B) ROME 02485, C) ROME 01884 
 
    ¶1.  SUMMARY.  THE UN JOINT INSPECTION UNIT (JIU) REPORT 
ON "REVIEW OF MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION IN THE FOOD 
AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UN" CONTAINS A NUMBER 
OF CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE AREAS 
OF RESULTS-BASED MANAGEMENT, FIELD OFFICES AND HUMAN 
RESOURCES MANAGEMENT.  WHILE REFLECTING THE MANAGEMENT 
IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE CURRENT DIRECTOR GENERAL (DG) HAS 
PUT IN PLACE, THE REPORT SHOWS THAT THE FAO STILL HAS A 
WAYS TO GO IN THE AREAS IDENTIFIED.  FAO MEMBERS HAVE 
WELCOMED THE REPORT AND REQUESTED THAT FAO MANAGEMENT 
PREPARE AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.  OF THE DG'S RESPONSES, 
HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO IMPROVE THE SELECTION PROCEDURE FOR 
FAO FIELD REPRESENTATIVES IS THE MOST DISTURBING. 
MISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE U.S. CONTINUE TO PRESS THIS 
ISSUE WITH THE CURRENT DG AND WITH FUTURE CANDIDATES FOR 
THE POSITION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  THE JIU REPORT ON "REVIEW OF MANAGEMENT AND 
ADMINISTRATION IN THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION 
OF THE UN" (JIU/REP/2002/8) CONTAINS A NUMBER OF 
IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FAO.  THREE ARE ADDRESSED 
TO THE FAO COUNCIL (SEE PARAS 9-11), AND THE REMAINDER TO 
THE FAO DG. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FAO DIRECTOR GENERAL 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FAO DG CONCENTRATE ON THREE 
MAIN AREAS:  RESULTS-BASED MANAGEMENT, IMPROVING 
MANAGEMENT OF FAO FIELD OFFICES AND REFORMING HUMAN 
RESOURCES MANAGEMENT. 

RESULTS BASED MANAGEMENT 
------------------------ 
 
¶4.  THE JIU RECOMMENDATION REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE 
FAO, SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CURRENT DG'S FIRST TERM 
(AND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF BUDGET DIRECTOR TONY WADE), 
HAS COME A LONG WAY TOWARDS RESULTS-BASED MANAGEMENT. 
NONETHELESS, THE JIU REPORT RECOMMENDED THAT THE 
ORGANIZATION CONTINUE TO LINK ACTIVITIES AND OVERALL 
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.  WEAKNESSES WERE IDENTIFIED IN 
MONITORING AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE PRIORITY AREAS FOR 
INTERDISCIPLINARY ACTION (PAIA'S) AND IN TRAINING IN THE 
NEW PROGRAMMING PROCESSES.   THE DG'S RESPONSE STRONGLY 
SUPPORTED ADDITIONAL TRAINING (RESOURCES PERMITTING); 
CONCERNING PAIA'S, THE DG'S RESPONSE ON PAIA'S WAS RATHER 
LUKEWARM, INDICATING SATISFACTION WITH THE CURRENT 
MECHANISMS FOR MONITORING. 
 
FAO FIELD PRESENCE 
------------------ 
 
¶5.  THE JIU RECOMMENDATIONS ON FIELD OFFICES HIGHLIGHTED 
A NUMBER OF WEAKNESSES THAT USDEL AND OTHER MEMBERS HAVE 
NOTED IN THE CURRENT FAO SYSTEM. 
 
-- REGIONAL AND COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES AND FAO POLICY: 
REGIONAL AND COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES ARE "BALKANIZED:" 
THEY NEVER MEET AS A GROUP AND ARE OFTEN OUTSIDE OF THE 
FAO POLICY LOOP. THIS WAS NEVER CLEARER THAN IN THE 
SUMMER OF 2002, DURING THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN FOOD 
    EMERGENCY, WHEN FAO REGIONAL AND COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES 
SPOKE OUT IN UNCOORDINATED WAYS ON THE ISSUE OF BIOTECH- 
ENGINEERED FOOD AID.  THE JIU RECOMMENDED MORE 
INTERACTION -- BY VIDEO-CONFERENCING, IF NECESSARY -- 
WITH FAO'S SENIOR MANAGEMENT.  THE DG AGREED TO CONSIDER 
THIS, BUT HIS OVERALL RESPONSE WAS UNENTHUSIASTIC 
(ARGUING THAT BUDGETS WOULD NOT PERMIT HOLDING PERIODIC 
MEETINGS OF FAO REPRESENTATIVES AND THAT VIDEO- 
CONFERENCING WAS EXPENSIVE AND UNWIELDY). 
 
-- ACCOUNTABILITY AND MANAGEMENT IN REGIONAL OFFICES: 
FAO' DECENTRALIZATION AND DEVOLUTION OF RESPONSIBILITY TO 
FAO COUNTRY OFFICES FROM FAO REGIONAL OFFICES, 
IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE CURRENT DG (AND 
SUPPORTED BY FAO MEMBERS) STILL NEEDS WORK.  ANECDOTAL 
EVIDENCE FROM FAO STAFF MEMBERS POSTED IN THE FIELD TO 
THIS EFFECT IS STRONGLY CORROBORATED IN THE JIU'S 
RECOMMENDATIONS.  IN ADDITION TO GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS 
ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY AND 
RESPONSIBILITY IN FAO REGIONAL OFFICES, THE JIU 
RECOMMENDED THAT THE "DG URGENTLY UNDERTAKE A REVIEW OF 
 
ROME 00003230  001.2 OF 003 
 
STRATION IN THE FOOD 
AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UN" CONTAINS A NUMBER 
OF CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE AREAS 
OF RESULTS-BASED MANAGEMENT, FIELD OFFICES AND HUMAN 
RESOURCES MANAGEMENT.  WHILE REFLECTING THE MANAGEMENT 
IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE CURRENT DIRECTOR GENERAL (DG) HAS 
PUT IN PLACE, THE REPORT SHOWS THAT THE FAO STILL HAS A

FAO FIELD PRESENCE

¶5.  THE JIU RECOMMENDATIONS ON FIELD OFFICES HIGHLIGHTED 
A NUMBER OF WEAKNESSES THAT USDEL AND OTHER MEMBERS HAVE 
NOTED IN THE CURRENT FAO SYSTEM. 
 
-- REGIONAL AND COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES AND FAO POLICY: 
REGIONAL AND COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES ARE "BALKANIZED:"

CONFERENCING WAS EXPENSIVE AND UNWIELDY). 
 
-- ACCOUNTABILITY AND MANAGEMENT IN REGIONAL OFFICES: 
FAO' DECENTRALIZATION AND DEVOLUTION OF RESPONSIBILITY TO 
FAO COUNTRY OFFICES FROM FAO REGIONAL OFFICES, 
IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE CURRENT DG (AND 
SUPPORTED BY FAO MEMBERS) STILL NEEDS WORK.  ANECDOTAL 
EVIDENCE FROM FAO STAFF MEMBERS POSTED IN THE FIELD TO 
THIS EFFECT IS STRONGLY CORROBORATED IN THE JIU'S 
RECOMMENDATIONS.  IN ADDITION TO GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS 
ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY AND 
RESPONSIBILITY IN FAO REGIONAL OFFICES, THE JIU 
RECOMMENDED THAT THE "DG URGENTLY UNDERTAKE A REVIEW OF 
 
ROME 00003230  002.1 OF 003 
 
THEM."   THE DG'S 
    RESPONSE ENDORSES THE RECOMMENDATION, WHILE NOTING THAT 
PROGRESS IS ALREADY BEING MADE IN THAT DIRECTION. 
 
-- SELECTION OF FAO REPRESENTATIVES:  THE FAO FIELD 
REPRESENTATIVES ARE CHOSEN DIRECTLY BY THE FAO DG.  THE 
QUALITY OF FAO REPRESENTATIVES IS NOTORIOUSLY UNEVEN. 
THE JIU RECOMMENDED THAT THE POSITIONS BE ADVERTISED AND 
THAT FAO REPRESENTATIVES BE SELECTED IN AN "OPEN AND FAIR 
PROCESS."  THE FAO DG RESPONDED THAT THE CURRENT 
SELECTION PROCESS WAS JUSTIFIED, ARGUING THAT THE FAO 
REPRESENTATIVES WERE "HIS REPRESENTATIVES WITH THE 
CONCERNED GOVERNMENTS." 
 
FAO HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
----------------------------- 
 
¶6.  REFORM OF MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICES:  THE JIU 
RECOMMENDED THAT THE DG ESTABLISH A TASK FORCES "TO 
PREPARE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION FOR THE REFORM OF 
HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES."  THE 
DG AGREED TO ESTABLISH SUCH A TASK FORCE.  IT IS OUR 
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SECRETARIAT'S COMPREHENSIVE REFORM 
OF PERSONNEL PRACTICES AND POLICY (AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED 
TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE) WILL BE THE BASIS FOR ONGOING 
WORK.  THE JIU REPORT MAKES CLEAR THAT THE JIU'S PRIMARY 
CONCERN IS TO ENSURE THAT STAFF REPRESENTATIVES ARE 
INCLUDED IN THE TASK FORCE, IN ORDER TO HAVE GREATER 
STAFF BUY-IN TO SUBSEQUENT PERSONNEL REFORMS. 
 
¶7.  A MORE FLEXIBLE, DYNAMIC AND RESPONSIVE WORKFORCE: 
THE JIU RECOMMENDED REDUCING THE NUMBER OF VACANT POSTS, 
    ACCELERATING THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS AND TAKING STEPS TO 
CREATE A MORE FLEXIBLE, DYNAMIC AND RESPONSIVE WORKFORCE. 
THE DG RESPONDED NEGATIVELY TO MOST OF THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS, ARGUING THAT VACANCIES ALLOW LINE 
MANAGERS TO MANAGE RESOURCES (WHICH ARE FUNGIBLE BETWEEN 
SALARY AND NON-SALARY ITEMS) EFFECTIVELY.  THE DG ALSO 
DID NOT SUPPORT ALLOWING REGIONAL OFFICES AUTHORITY TO 
PROPOSE CANDIDATES FOR POSTS UP TO P-4, ARGUING THAT THE 
RESPONSIBILITY LIES WITH HEADQUARTERS.  FAO COUNTER- 
ARGUMENTS ON THE WISDOM OF USING CONSULTANTS AND RETIREES 
AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO STAFF NOTED THAT THERE WERE EXISTING 
LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF SUCH CONSULTANTS.  AND FINALLY, 
ON THE RECOMMENDATION ON ESTABLISHING A "MANAGED MOBILITY 
SYSTEM" THE DG ARGUED THAT "ROTATION POLICY BETWEEN HG 
AND FIELD" WAS NOT A HIGH PRIORITY AT THE CURRENT TIME. 
 
¶8.  IMPROVING THE GENDER BALANCE: THE JIU RECOMMENDED 
THAT FAO REVISE ITS NEPOTISM POLICY (WHICH CURRENTLY 
PROHIBITS SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT) AS A MEANS OF IMPROVING 
GENDER BALANCE.  FAO MEMBERS HAVE NOTED REPEATEDLY THAT 
THIS REVISION IS LONG OVERDUE.  WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED 
THAT THE FINANCE COMMITTEE WILL FINALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO 
REVIEW THE FAO'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ISSUE THIS YEAR. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COUNCIL 
-------------------------- 
 
¶9. CAPITAL BUDGETING: THE JIU RECOMMENDED THAT COUNCIL 
ENDORSE THE INTRODUCTION OF CAPITAL BUDGETING, "TO ENSURE 
SUFFICIENT AND STABLE FUNDING FOR THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT 
OF CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS."  THE FINANCE 
    COMMITTEE HAS THE ITEM UNDER CONSIDERATION. 
 
¶10.  CRITERIA FOR COUNTRY OFFICES:  THE JIU ALSO 
RECOMMENDED THAT COUNCIL FORMALLY DEFINE A SET OF 
OBJECTIVE CRITERIA TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF 
FAO COUNTRY REPRESENTATION, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE 
SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE COST- 
EFFECTIVENESS OF FAO ACTIVITIES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. 
THE COUNCIL HAS DEBATED THIS QUESTION IN THE CONTEXT OF 
THE PROGRAM OF WORK AND BUDGET.  OVER OECD COUNTRY 
OBJECTIONS, THE G-77 CONTINUES TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL FAO 
COUNTRY OFFICES, AND THE DG'S DRAFT PROGRAM OF WORK AND 
BUDGET HAS ACCOMMODATED THESE REQUESTS (AT THE EXPENSE OF 
OTHER ACTIVITIES).  THE MATTER WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
DEBATED IN THE UPCOMING 2004-2005 BUDGET CONTEXT. 
 
¶11.  LIMITATION OF TERM OF EXTERNAL AUDITOR:  UNDER 
CONSIDERATION BY THE FINANCE COMMITTEE.

AO FINANCE 
    AND PROGRAM COMMITTEE (REFTEL A), THE 102ND SESSION OF 
THE FAO FINANCE COMMITTEE (REFTEL B) AND THE 124TH 
COUNCIL.  THE GENEVA GROUP ALSO DISCUSSED THE JIU REPORT 
(REFTEL C).  ALL OF THESE BODIES WELCOMED THE REPORT AND 
TOOK THE RECOMMENDATIONS VERY SERIOUSLY.  THE JOINT 
SESSION REQUESTED THAT FAO MANAGEMENT PREPARE A "TIME- 
BOUND ACTION PLAN WITH ACTION OFFICES INDICATED COVERING 
ON-GOING OR PLANNED FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITIES."  IN ADDITION, 
SOME ITEMS ARE SPECIFICALLY FOR FAO FINANCE COMMITTEE OR 
FAO COUNCIL FOLLOW-UP. 
 
¶13.  IN INSTANCES WHERE THE FAO HAS DECLINED TO FOLLOW 
THE JIU RECOMMENDATION, IT FALLS TO FAO MEMBER TO PURSUE 
THE ISSUE IN THE APPROPRIATE GOVERNING BODIES (GENERALLY 
THE FINANCE OR PROGRAM COMMITTEE). 
 
COMMENT

¶14.  WHILE REFLECTING THE MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS THAT 
THE CURRENT DIRECTOR GENERAL (DG) HAS PUT IN PLACE, THE 
REPORT SHOWS THAT THE FAO STILL HAS A WAYS TO GO IN 
PUTTING INTO PLACE RESULTS-BASED MANAGEMENT AND IMPROVING 
MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES AND FAO FIELD OFFICES.  THE 
LAST ITEM IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: MUCH GREATER ATTENTION 
NEEDS TO BE GIVEN TO ENSURING THAT FAO COUNTRY AND 
REGIONAL OFFICES ARE EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THEIR NEW 
RESPONSIBILITIES. OF THE DG'S RESPONSES, HIS 
UNWILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER CHANGING THE SELECTION 
PROCEDURE FOR FAO REPRESENTATIVES IS THE MOST DISTURBING. 
MISSION RECOMMENDS THAT THE USG CONTINUE TO PRESS THIS 
CHANGE WITH THE CURRENT DG AND WITH FUTURE CANDIDATES FOR 
    THE POSITION.  TAMLYN
