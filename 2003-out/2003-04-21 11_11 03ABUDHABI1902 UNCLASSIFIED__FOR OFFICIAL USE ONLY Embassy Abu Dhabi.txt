SUBJECT:  UAE CREATES NEW LABOR INSPECTION PLAN OF 
COMPANIES 
 
REF: ABU DHABI 1634 
 
¶1. (U) Local press reported on April 18 that the 
Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs has developed a 
new inspection and training plan centered on improving 
the quality of labor inspection. The objective of the 
program is to create safer and more secure working 
conditions by encouraging companies to comply more 
strictly with current labor regulations.  The new 
inspection plan also better conforms with the 
International Labour Organization's Labour Inspection 
Convention No. 81. The plan envisages hiring 440 new 
labor inspectors by the end of 2005, technical 
training for inspectors in line with international 
standards, developing their ability to advise the 
companies being inspected on the most effective means 
of complying with the labor law, and increased 
automation of the inspection process by utilizing 
high-tech equipment. The UAE labor law requires that 
companies be inspected twice annually or as often as 
necessary to ensure the effective application of 
regulations. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: This new inspection plan 
demonstrates a continuing commitment on part of the 
UAEG to comply with international labor standards.  It 
also comes on the heels of the disappointing amnesty 
program which so far has failed to live up to 
expectations.  (See reftel).  Though the proposed 
program is ostensibly about improving labor conditions 
and transferring technical knowledge from inspectors 
to businesses, an important secondary consideration of 
inspections is cracking down on illegal workers who do 
not take advantage of the amnesty.  By publicizing 
broadly the intentions of the government to implement 
a comprehensive new inspection plan, the Ministry is 
also broadcasting loudly that it intends to crack down 
on illegal labor and the companies that hire such 
workers.  End comment.
