ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
 
 
¶15. SABAH: The new border gate located between 
Mardin and Sirnak aims to abandon the existing 
Habur Border Gate which passes through Iraq's 
Kurdish region under Mesut Barzani's control. 
It is reported that IKDP charged a "Transit 
Tax" up to one hundred USD. After strong 
reaction, the tax, which was reduced to twenty- 
five USD until recently, has been lifted. But 
the Turkish truckers bringing around 800 liters 
of oil from Iraq are being charged around 34 
USD under the name of "fine". Nusaybin's sub- 
governor, Omer Ulu, said opening of a second 
gate had been on the agenda of the government 
for a long time, and part of the road for the 
second gate with Iraq would pass via Syria, 
too. With opening and shifting of trade to the 
second gate, IKDP will suffer great financial 
losses.
