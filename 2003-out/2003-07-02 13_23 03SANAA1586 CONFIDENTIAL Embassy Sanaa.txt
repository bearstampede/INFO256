¶1.  (C)  Summary:  The Ambassador called on Foreign Minister 
Qirbi July 2 upon the FM's return from Germany and France. 
He urged increased assistance to the Palestinian Authority 
per reftel A.  They discussed the al-Moayed case, current 
Coast Guard training in Aden, the impressive role of the 
U.S.-trained Central Security Forces (CSF) in the Abyan 
operation (ref B) and other topics.  The Ambassador also met 
with Qirbi one-on-one to discuss terrorist financing 
(septel).  A/DCM and Acting Pol/Econ Chief accompanied the 
Ambassador.  End Summary.

Middle East Peace Negotiations:  Secretary's Message 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2.  (C)  Ambassador delivered Secretary's message in reftel 
¶A.  He also highlighted the encouraging progress recently and 
the ongoing U.S. high-level engagement.  Qirbi responded that 
there was a dispute between the ROYG and the Arab League 
regarding Yemen's assessment.  Before unification in 1990, 
North Yemen and South Yemen each contributed 1% of the Arab 
League budget, for a total of 2%.  After 1990, the ROYG 
maintained that its proper assessment is still 1% while the 
Arab League maintains 2%.  Assistance to Palestine is based 
on the Arab League assessment.  Hence, the ROYG feels it has 
fully paid while the Arab League considers it only 50% paid. 
The Ambassador said that this was not a usual time in the 
peace process, progress was becoming possible and the ROYG 
should increase its contribution regardless of any dispute. 
 
¶3.  (C)  The Ambassador cautioned Qirbi on contributions to 
Hamas and other radical Palestinian groups, noting that the 
ROYG needs to make sure that contributions, both official and 
non-official, go to the right place.  Ambassador said that 
contributions are vitally needed to buttress Abu Mazen and 
other legitimate charity groups such as the Red Crescent 
Society.  Qirbi said it was a contentious issue, saying that 
Hamas had recently showed flexibility and "we need to exert 
pressure" on them to support Abu Mazen.  He referenced a 
British House of Commons report that claimed that 80-90% of 
Hamas funding was used for legitimate charity.  Qirbi said 
the impetus should be on how to influence its military wing 
to stop attacks. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Qirbi noted that Yemen has established a committee 
to handle official and public contributions for the 
Palestinians, headed by Deputy Prime Minister (and 
MinFinance) al-Salami and composed of NGO representatives and 
ROYG officials.  This committee has already changed emphasis 
to increased aid to the PA, therefore reducing contributions 
to Hamas.  The Ambassador said he would discuss this issue 
with the Deputy PM and encouraged the ROYG to study further 
efforts to give Abu Mazen the strongest possible hand.

President Saleh's visit to Germany -- al-Moayed 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶5.  (C)  The Ambassador and FM discussed the upcoming 
resolution to the al-Moayed case in Germany, including the 
timing of extradition and the potential appeals process.  The 
Ambassador noted that we need to work together on managing 
public sentiment at extradition, particularly regarding 
security issues.  Qirbi agreed that the "security, public 
responses and political impact" should be discussed and 
managed.  Qirbi said he did not know if an appeals process 
was beneficial or not, but noted that delaying the 
extradition would "give us a chance to work out a mechanism" 
by which al-Moayed can cooperate and give information.  He 
said that Yemen needs to be convinced of his culpability, and 
wondered if the Yemeni people would accept the situation 
otherwise if the case was not made. 
 
---------------------------- 
Coast Guard Training in Aden; 
Central Security Forces (CSF) 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (C)  The Ambassador informed Qirbi about the Coast Guard 
training in Aden, noting its importance as part of ongoing CT 
cooperation.  He also congratulated Qirbi on the performance 
of the U.S.-trained CSF forces in the Abyan operation (ref B) 
and the visit by CSF commander to Tampa and Washington in 
August. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Other Issues:  U/S Bolton Visit; Car Exemptions; 
Ambassador's Washington Consultations 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶7.  (C)  The Ambassador thanked Qirbi for meeting with 
UnderSecretary Bolton June 17 (ref C).  He said it was a 
productive visit, particularly the discussions on Article 98 
and the DPRK.  Qirbi expressed appreciation when the 
Ambassador informed him of the recent release of humanitarian 
demining funds as a tangible result of the UnderSecretary's 
visit.  A/DCM mentioned that he was working the issue of car 
exemptions with the MFA head of protocol, where several 
armored and regular vehicles were being held up in 
bureaucratic delays.  Qirbi indicated that he expected the 
issue to be expedited.  The Ambassador briefed Qirbi on his 
recent Washington consultations.  He told Qirbi that he 
discussed his idea of a strategic dialogue with Washington 
officials, and that the suggestion was to focus on a 
substantive agenda. The Ambassador suggested two important 
topics, arms flows and money flows, and suggested they 
discuss it further.
