¶1. (C) PER REFTEL A, WE HAVE PREPARED A LIST OF SPECIFIC 
INCIDENTS HIGHLIGHTING OUR CONCERNS (REF C) ABOUT ITF 
    DIRECTOR JERNEJ CIMPERSEK,S SUITABILITY TO CONTINUE IN HIS 
CURRENT POSITION: 
 
--  LAST OCTOBER, CIMPERSEK DISPLAYED UNPROFESSIONAL AND 
UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR DURING A/S BLOOMFIELD'S VISIT TO 
CROATIA TO ATTEND A DEMINING CONFERENCE IN DUBROVNIK.  DURING 
MEETINGS WITH GOC OFFICIALS AND IN PRIVATE MEETINGS WITH U.S. 
OFFICIALS, CIMPERSEK HAD TO BE REPEATEDLY TOLD THAT HIS 
TEMPERAMENTAL AND OPENLY HOSTILE BEHAVIOR WAS NOT HELPFUL IN 
RESOLVING DISPUTES WITH SENIOR GOC OFFICIALS.  CIMPERSEK 
RESPONDED BY SIMPLY DECLARING HIS DISDAIN FOR THE GOC 
OFFICIALS INVOLVED. 
 
--  LAST NOVEMBER, WHEN POLOFF VISITED LJUBLJANA TO MEET WITH 
ITF AND PM/HDP OFFICIALS FROM WASHINGTON, WHO WERE IN TOWN TO 
ATTEND THE NIGHT OF A THOUSAND DINNERS EVENT, CIMPERSEK 
LAUNCHED AN EXPLETIVE-FILLED SCREED AT POLOFF.  HE COMPLAINED 
BITTERLY ABOUT MANY OF THE KEY DEMINING PLAYERS IN CROATIA 
AND LAUNCHED SIMILAR CRITICISMS AGAINST EMBASSY ZAGREB AND 
SENIOR USG OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON.  PM/HDP OFFICIALS WHO 
HEARD CIMPERSEK, INCLUDING THE THEN REGIONAL MANAGER FOR THE 
BALKANS WHO WAS CO-LOCATED AT ITF HEADQUARTERS, WERE SHOCKED. 
 
 
--  DURING POLOFF,S VISIT TO ITF HEADQUARTERS EARLIER THIS 
YEAR TO MEET WITH THE FORMER PM/HDP BALKANS REGIONAL MANAGER, 
CIMPERCEK AGAIN LAUNCHED INTO A TIRADE ABOUT HIS DISPLEASURE 
WITH CROATIANS AND USED EXPLETIVES TO VOICE DISGUST WITH U.S. 
OFFICIALS WHO DEMANDED THAT HE PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN 
DEALING WITH CROATIAN AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN THE DEMINING 
COMMUNITY IN THE REGION.  HIS ACTIONS PROVOKED A STRONG 
    RESPONSE FROM THE THEN REGIONAL MANAGER WHO SUGGESTED TO 
CIMPERSEK THAT HE RESIGN IF HE NO LONGER WANTED TO PERFORM 
THE DUTIES OF THE JOB. 
 
--  DURING POLOFF,S OTHER VISITS TO ITF HEADQUARTERS AND 
DURING MEETINGS IN OTHER LOCATIONS WITH CIMPERSEK, CIMPERSEK 
WOULD OPENLY STATE HIS EFFORTS TO DEFLECT ATTENTION AWAY FROM 
DEMINING PROJECTS IN CROATIA AND HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE 
SUPPORT TO CROATIA.  WHEN POLOFF TRIED TO CONVEY TO CIMPERSEK 
THAT THE USG MUST ENGAGE THE GOC IN A PROFESSIONAL AND 
DIPLOMATIC MANNER, CIMPERSEK RESPONDED THAT HE WAS SLOVENIAN 
AND DID NOT SHARE THE USG,S VIEW.  THIS WAS ALSO HIS 
ATTITUDE TOWARD OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, PARTICULARLY 
BIH AND SERBIA MONTENEGRO. 
 
--  SLOVENIAN OFFICIALS WORKING AT THE ITF HAVE CONFIDED TO 
US THAT CIMPERSEK IS UNABLE TO CONTROL HIS TEMPER AND 
OFTENTIMES THEY ARE THE VICTIMS OF HIS RAGE.  THEY HAVE 
OFFERED APOLOGIES ON HIS BEHALF.  CIMPERSEK, HOWEVER, HAS 
NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR ANY INCIDENTS AND MADE COMMITMENTS TO 
TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS.
