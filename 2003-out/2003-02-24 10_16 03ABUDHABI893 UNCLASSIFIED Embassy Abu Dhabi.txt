SUBJECT:  THANKS TO THE REMOTE SENSING 
INTERAGENCY TEAM 
 
 
Assistant Secretary Wolf:  I'd like to extend my heartfelt 
thanks to Delegation head NP/ECNP Director Chris Kessler, 
NP/ECNP FAO Lisa Beames, NIMA Director of International 
Plans and Policy Robert Weber, Acting Commerce/NOAA Chief 
of Satellite Activities Branch Tim Stryker and JCS Space 
Policy Branch Chief LTC Max Clayton for their visit last 
week to the UAE to discuss remote sensing issues with the 
UAE military.  The team braved a Washington blizzard, 
missed onward European connections, and went two days 
without luggage in order to make it to Abu Dhabi for these 
meetings.  They arrived and went directly into a marathon 
session -- heroic measures indeed!  The Emiratis, from 
Armed Forces Chief of Staff LTG Muhammad bin Zayid Al- 
Nahyan to Director of Military Intelligence Brigadier 
Muhammad Al-Neyyadi and Space Reconnaissance Center 
Director LTC Mahash Al-Hameli, were all extremely 
appreciative of the visit.  I understand that the meetings 
were very illuminating and that the interagency will have 
much to discuss before the next session with the Emiratis. 
Please rest assured that my staff and I stand ready to 
assist the Department and the interagency team on follow-up 
steps as needed.  Regards from the UAE.
