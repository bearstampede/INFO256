for the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) draft 
Declaration of Principles and draft Plan of Action to Dutch 
MFA Human Rights Policy Advisor Jeroen van Drunen on 
September 12.  Drunen said he conferred with his colleagues 
in the UN office, and the Dutch have "no problem supporting 
the U.S. position" in the upcoming PrepCom 3 meeting in 
Geneva September 15-26.  He added that the Dutch have 
"exactly the same issues" with the two drafts, and share U.S. 
concerns.  Drunen is waiting for an answer on the 
NWICO-affiliated text, but does not foresee any problems.
