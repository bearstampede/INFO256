SUBJECT:  SCENESETTER FOR VICE ADMIRAL KEATING'S VISIT TO 
THE UAE 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, Reasons 
1.5(b) and (d). 
 
¶2. (S) Vice Admiral Keating:  I look forward to welcoming 
you back to the UAE in a few days.  The staff at the 
Embassy in Abu Dhabi and Consulate General in Dubai are 
making all the arrangements to ensure your visit to the UAE 
is a rewarding one.  UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff LTG 
Sheikh Muhammad bin Zayed Al-Nahyan (MbZ), Commander of UAE 
Naval Forces Major General Suhail Al-Marar, and Dubai Crown 
Prince Gen. Sheikh Muhammad bin Rashid Al-Maktoum (MbR) all 
welcome this opportunity to meet with you and exchange 
ideas on this, your farewell tour to the UAE. 
 
¶3. (S) Your visit to the Emirates comes on the heels of 
visits by General Abizaid (September 8) and General 
Buchanan (September 7 and 8).  Their discussions were 
fruitful, covering a range of bilateral military themes, 
and some of the broader themes of regional interest, such 
as Iraq and Afghanistan.  You can anticipate similar 
discussions during your visit. 
 
---------------- 
SUGGESTED THEMES 
---------------- 
 
¶4. (S) We know you are engaged on the numerous bilateral 
issues listed below, but we wanted to ensure all topics are 
addressed.  Additional general themes are described in para 
four. 
 
-- The Emiratis will want to engage you on the issue of 
carrier berthing arrangements at Jebel Ali.  As you know, 
the current carrier berth is a container terminal.  The 
Dubai Port Authority wants to reclaim it for berthing of 
container traffic only, and has proposed that a different 
part of Jebel Ali be used for the Navy's operations.  The 
Dubai Port Authority has indicated that it wants the move 
to occur soon.  NAVCENT and the Dubai Port Authority need 
to discuss dredging and berthing development costs.  It 
should be noted that the move would also affect USO 
facilities; (MbR, Suhail) 
 
-- Let Gen. Suhail know that you look forward to his 
attendance and participation at the International Sea Power 
Symposium at the Naval War College, Oct. 26-29.  The 
symposium brings together all the chiefs of naval 
operations and their counterparts; (Suhail) 
 
-- Express thanks for the UAE's cooperation and excellent 
coordination between the Dubai Port Authority, the Fujairah 
Port Authority, and the US Navy in the run-up and 
throughout OIF; (MbZ, MbR, Suhail) 
 
-- Acknowledge the role of the UAE Navy frigate -- The 
Emirates  as the flagship for the naval component of 
Peninsula Shield forces during OIF; (MbZ, Suhail) 
 
-- The Dubai Air Show takes place December 7-11.  The UAE 
Government regards this as a major event and expects strong 
US support and presence.  You can anticipate a request to 
provide aircraft static display and possibly an aircraft 
carrier visit for the Air Show; (MbZ, MbR, Suhail) 
 
-- Urge resumption of long-postponed talks between NAVCENT 
and UAE navy staff.  These meetings, which are part of a 
wider engagement plan with the UAE, should be held 
annually; (MbZ, Suhail) 
 
-- State that you are looking forward to commencing 
operations in late 2004 at the Air Logistics facility at 
Minhad;  (MbZ, Suhail) 
 
-- The Emiratis have proposed a visit to the US Navy Chief 
of Operations in March 2004.  We are currently working with 
Major General Suhail's staff to develop a plan for the 
visit. (Suhail) 
 
-- Acknowledge that Jebel Ali is the primary port of call 
for liberty in the Gulf and express thanks to Dubai for 
playing host to our sailors; (MbR) 
 
-- Discuss the legal status of US Navy sailors picked up 
during liberty in Dubai.  This ties into the DCA legal 
jurisdiction issue which is the article the UAE does not 
consider "in effect."  We appreciate MbR's assistance in 
returning those sailors who are detained; (MbR) 
-- Appreciate allowing US Navy Force Protection units to 
operate in Jebel Ali and Fujairah, especially the use of 
Fujairah Naval Base to store equipment and boats while not 
in use; (MbZ, MbR, Suhail) 
 
-- Express appreciation for Dubai's patience with the issue 
of Chinese-manufactured patrol boats and storage at Jebel 
Ali.  We anticipate transfer to the new Iraqi navy in the 
near future.  (MbR) 
 
¶5. (S) More broadly, you may also wish to: 
 
-- Express thanks for the UAE's exemplary support for U.S. 
and coalition efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, namely 
access to bases and logistical support, including air and 
sealift of Bulgarian troops to Iraq, the UAE SOC deployment 
at Bagram, as well as extensive intelligence coordination; 
(MbZ, MbR, Suhail) 
 
-- Pass on our gratitude for the UAE's generous 
humanitarian assistance, especially the UAE Armed Force's 
establishment of the very successful Sheikh Zayed hospital 
in Baghdad and the UAE's efforts to re-supply with 
equipment and medicine other Iraqi hospitals and the 
provision of basic foodstuffs to the Iraqi people; (MbZ) 
 
-- (If raised) Iraq oil smuggling: Per our exchange earlier 
this week on this subject, the Iraqis need to act against 
the smugglers by seizing vessels and prosecuting crews. 
That should be an effective deterrent.  That said, your 
visit is an excellent opportunity to raise the subject 
during your meetings. 
 
¶6. (U) Regards from Abu Dhabi, Marcelle.
