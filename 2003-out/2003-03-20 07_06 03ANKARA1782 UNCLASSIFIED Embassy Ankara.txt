¶1.  This is an action message.  Please see paragraph 3. 
 
 
¶2.  On March 17 polmiloff received a call from Oya Ergin of 
the MFA NATO Department.  She informed that the GOT had 
almost completed its review of the Reftel text we had 
provided on October 16, 2002.  When the review is complete, 
Post expects that there may be other issues for which we will 
request Department guidance.  In the meantime, the Turks are 
concerned that if the USG insists on their using the word 
"agreement" in the MFA's response to the USG (as suggested in 
Reftel paragraph 7), Turkish law and practice will require 
that it be sent to the Prime Ministry for vetting and 
approval.  Ergin predicted that going this route would take a 
"long time." 
 
 
¶3.  Action Request: At polmiloff's request, MFA provided its 
preferred text for our review.  In lieu of "shall constitute 
an agreement," the GOT proposes that it use "will be 
considered as a political commitment."  Post requests the 
Department's guidance on whether the GOT's choice of words is 
acceptable to the USG.  End Action Request.
