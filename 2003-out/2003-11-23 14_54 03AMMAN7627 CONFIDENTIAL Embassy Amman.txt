SUBJECT: RED CROSS/RED CRESCENT STANDING COMMISSION 
CANDIDATE DR. MOHAMED AL-HADID 
 
REF: STATE 322318 
 
Classified By: DCM David Hale, per 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (C) Embassy Amman supports the candidacy of Jordan Red 
Crescent Society (JRCS) President Dr. Mohamed Al-Hadid for 
re-election to the Standing Commission of the Red Cross and 
Red Crescent Movement.  Al-Hadid supports strong relations 
with the United States Government and U.S. humanitarian 
organizations.  Under his leadership, the Jordan Red Crescent 
Society has maintained strong ties to the American Red Cross 
and currently is exploring expansion of existing JRCS/AmCross 
technical assistance arrangements.  In spite of regional 
tensions, Al-Hadid also has supported quiet engagement with 
the Israeli Magen David Adom Society and could play a helpful 
role on the emblem debate through a second term on the 
Standing Commission.  We understand from NGO contacts that 
Al-Hadid has expressed interest in running for a "leadership 
position" (no further information) on the Standing Commission. 
 
¶2.  (C) Finally, we note that Al-Hadid has a mixed reputation 
in Amman, where his fellow humanitarian organizations 
(including the International Federation of the Red Cross/Red 
Crescent Societies) and donor organizations are critical of 
his management abilities.  While we share these operational 
concerns, we do not believe they would affect Al-Hadid's 
ability to exercise an effective political leadership role in 
the Standing Commission.
