¶3. (C) In an interview with the official news agency Petra 
April 2, King Abdullah said that he is "in harmony with... 
our people who reject the invasion of Iraq."  He said that 
Jordan had used its good offices with influential countries 
to avert the war.  He said that the Iraqi people should have 
the right to choose their own leadership, and described as 
"groundless" allegations that Jordan's airspace or territory 
have been used for attacks on Iraq.  "Frankly speaking, we 
have been asked to open our airspace for military airplanes, 
but we firmly rejected that," he said.  The King's somewhat 
stronger public stance against the war comes in reaction to 
intense public pressure and nearly universal opposition to 
the war.

government.  Additional demonstrations are also anticipated
