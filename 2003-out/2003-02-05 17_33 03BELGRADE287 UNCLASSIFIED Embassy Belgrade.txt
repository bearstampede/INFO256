SUBJECT: SERBIA AND MONTNEGRO: FEDERAL TRANSITION 
 
REF: BELGRADE 278 
 
Â¶1. WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER AND THE 
CHARTER IMPLEMENTATION LAW, "YUGOSLAVIA" CEASES TO EXIST AND 
THE NEW STATE OF "SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO" IS ESTABLISHED (SEE 
REFTEL).  HOWEVER, THERE IS FULL CONTINUITY BETWEEN THE OLD 
STATE AND THE NEW STATE.  THEREFORE, INSTITUTIONS AND 
OFFICIALS OF "YUGOSLAVIA" WILL CONTINUE TO PERFORM THEIR 
DUTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CHARTER UNTIL NEW OFFICIALS ARE 
ELECTED AND NEW BODIES ARE FORMED.  THIS REFERS TO THE 
FEDERAL PARLIAMENT, PRESIDENT OF THE FRY, FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, 
FEDERAL COURT AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT.  ACCORDING TO 
THE IMPLEMENTATION LAW, ALL INSTITUTIONS OF THE NEW UNION OF 
SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO HAVE TO BE ELECTED OR FORMED WITHIN 
THIRTY DAYS.  THE LAW ON IMPLEMENTATION STIPULATES THAT FRY 
BODIES WILL PERFORM THEIR WORK UNTIL NEW BODIES ARE ELECTED, 
BUT CAN "BRING ONLY THOSE DECISIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR 
OBSTACLE-FREE FUNCTIONING OF THE UNION OF SERBIA AND 
MONTENEGRO".
