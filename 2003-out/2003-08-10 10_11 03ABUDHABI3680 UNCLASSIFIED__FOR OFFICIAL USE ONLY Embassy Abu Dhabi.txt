¶1. (SBU) Shaykh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the President 
of the UAE, is currently vacationing at his villa in France 
near Geneva.  We expect him to continue his vacation in 
Morocco.  Our MFA Protocol contacts were not able to 
pinpoint his date of return to Abu Dhabi.  Because of Sh. 
Zayed's advanced age and uncertain health, meetings with 
him are normally only confirmed at the last minute. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Please advise if the NSC would like us to request 
a meeting for the President's Special Envoy, Zalmay 
Khalilzad, with Sh. Zayed or another UAEG official, such as 
Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan or 
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayed Al 
Nahyan, both of whom are expected to be in country during 
the timeframe mentioned in reftel. 
 
¶3. (U) Kabul minimize considered.
