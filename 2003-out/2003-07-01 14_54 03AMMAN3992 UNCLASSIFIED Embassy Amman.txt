SUBJECT: PRM AMBASSADORS' FUND REQUEST FOR PALESTINIAN 
REFUGEES IN JORDAN 
 
REF:  A) 02 STATE 66319 
      B) POLASCHIK/LEVIN JUNE 23 TELCON 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY: AMBASSADOR REQUESTS USD 20,000 UNDER THE PRM 
AMBASSADORS' FUND FOR REFUGEES IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO 
BUILD A 177 SQUARE-METER ADDITION TO THE WOMEN'S PROGRAM 
CENTER AT JERASH REFUGEE CAMP.  THE ADDITION WILL ALLOW 
THE CENTER TO ESTABLISH THREE INCOME-GENERATION PROJECTS 
(WITH A PROJECTED INCOME OF USD 250 PER MONTH) AND EXPAND 
ITS EXISTING DAYCARE PROGRAM TO SERVE AN ADDITIONAL 30 
CHILDREN.  THE INCOME-GENERATION PROJECTS WILL INCREASE 
THE FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY OF THE WOMEN'S CENTER AND 
ENABLE IT TO EXPAND PROGRAMMING AND TRAINING 
OPPORTUNITIES TO AN ADDITIONAL 35 WOMEN PER MONTH.  THE 
PROJECT ALSO WILL FURTHER OVERALL USG REFUGEE GOALS OF 
STRENGTHENING AND PROMOTING GENDER EQUALITY.  WITH ONLY 
NOMINAL UNRWA TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SUCH WOMEN'S 
PROGRAM CENTERS, THIS PROJECT RESPONDS TO A CRITICAL GAP 
IN REFUGEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN JORDAN.  PER REF B, WE 
UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEADLINE FOR OUR SUBMISSION HAS BEEN 
EXTENDED TO JULY 3.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  THE WOMEN'S PROGRAM CENTER (WPC) IN JERASH REFUGEE 
CAMP WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1989 WITH SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT 
FROM UNRWA.  ALTHOUGH IT RECEIVES A MODEST SUBSIDY FROM 
UNRWA (USD 6,000 PER YEAR), THIS INDEPENDENT, COMMUNITY- 
BASED ORGANIZATION RELIES ON THE FEES CHARGED TO COURSE 
PARTICIPANTS AND DAYCARE CLIENTS TO COVER ITS RUNNING 
COSTS.  THE JERASH WPC DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES 
TO COVER A CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT.  THE CENTER PROVIDES 
VOCATIONAL TRAINING (SEWING, COMPUTER AND HAIRDRESSING 
COURSES), DAYCARE, FITNESS AND LEGAL AID PROGRAMS IN 
ADDITION TO WOMEN'S RIGHTS WORKSHOPS.  1,500 WOMEN 
PARTICIPATE IN THE CENTER'S PROGRAMMING EACH YEAR.   A 
DYNAMIC AND WELL-ORGANIZED VOLUNTARY BOARD OF NINE WOMEN 
GOVERNS THE CENTER, AND UNRWA PROVIDES TECHNICAL 
ASSISTANCE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CENTER.  MOST OF 
JERASH CAMP'S RESIDENTS ARE ORIGINALLY FROM GAZA AND 
THEREFORE INELIGIBLE FOR JORDANIAN CITIZENSHIP, A 
SIGNIFICANT SOCIO-ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE. 
 
¶3.  PRM FUNDING IS REQUESTED TO CONSTRUCT A 177-SQUARE 
METER ADDITION TO THE JERASH WPC.  THE ADDITIONAL SPACE 
WILL ALLOW THE CENTER TO ESTABLISH THREE INCOME 
GENERATION PROJECTS (COMMERCIAL SPACES THAT WILL BE 
LEASED TO PRIVATE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE CAMP'S FIRST 
PRIVATE FEMALE PHYSICIAN) AND A 50-SQUARE METER ADDITION 
TO ITS DAYCARE CENTER, ENABLING THE CENTER TO SERVE AN 
ADDITIONAL 30 CHILDREN.  THE INCOME GENERATION PROJECTS 
ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE USD 250 OF REVENUE FOR THE 
CENTER, STRENGTHENING THE FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE AND 
SUSTAINABILITY OF THE CENTER.  THE WPC WILL USE THE 
ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO INCREASE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
WOMEN, TO HOLD ADDITIONAL WORKSHOPS ON LEGAL AID AND 
WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND TO ORGANIZE NEW PROGRAMMING FOR THE 
CAMP'S YOUTH.  THE WOMEN'S CENTER WILL CONTRIBUTE USD 
1,400 OF ITS OWN FUNDS TOWARD THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS.  A 
CONTRIBUTION OF USD 20,000 IS REQUESTED TO COVER THE 
REMAINING CONSTRUCTION COSTS. 
 
¶4.  JERASH CAMP'S WPC WOULD IMPLEMENT THE PROJECT, 
INCLUDING CONTRACTING AND SUPERVISION OF ALL CONSTRUCTION 
SERVICES.  REFCOORD WOULD MONITOR THE PROJECT.  POST HAS 
THE AUTHORITY AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO TRANSFER THESE 
FUNDS TO THE INTENDED RECIPIENT AGENCY. 
 
¶5.  PER REF B, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEADLINE FOR OUR 
SUBMISSION HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO JULY 3.
