¶1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C) Ambassador delivered 4/18 DoD Undersecretary 
Dov Zakheim's letter to UAE Minister of State for 
Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan, 
requesting the UAEG to donate petroleum products to 
Iraq.  The letter listed the quantities of petroleum 
products in ref A demarche.  Shaykh Hamdan indicated 
that the UAE would consider providing refined 
petroleum products to Iraq, but said the UAEG would 
want to be compensated out of future Iraqi production. 
We understand that Washington agencies are looking 
into the legality and modality of swap options, and 
would appreciate guidance we can share with the UAEG. 
 
¶3.  (C) The Ambassador further raised ref A points 
with UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff Shaykh Mohammed 
bin Zayid Al-Nahyan.  MbZ was aware of the demarche 
and admitted that he had been somewhat taken aback by 
the sheer volume of what was being requested, as well 
as the number of items on the laundry list of needed 
supplies.  Were we asking the UAEG to provide all of 
the items or were certain items higher priorities than 
others?  This should be specified.  MbZ also suggested 
that the requests for oil or oil products should 
follow the 80-10-10 formula based on national oil 
output -- that is, we ask Saudi Arabia to provide 80 
percent of the required oil, and approach Kuwait and 
the UAE to each provide 10 percent of the 
requirements.  Post notes that previous requests for 
oil assistance to Jordan, for example, followed this 
formula.
