H.E. Mr. Hor Hamhong 
Senior Minister, 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation 
Phnom Penh 
 
Dear Mr. Chairman, 
 
With reference to your letter dated 11th February 2003 
concerning the situation on the Korean peninsula, I fully 
share your view and would like to reaffirm Viet Nam's strong 
support for Cambodia's active role as the current ARF Chair. 
 
Concerning your intention to invite some Foreign Ministers 
from ARF countries to serve as "friends of ARF Chair," I am 
of the view that if you sense the consensus from other 
responses, particularly from countries directly concerned 
like China, the USA, Russia, Japan and two Koreas, then I 
would support the establishment of such a group.  With 
regards to your suggestion that two ASEAN Foreign Ministers 
and another two from non-ASEAN countries be invited, I would 
follow Mr. Chairman's and other ASEAN Colleagues' guidance 
on who should be invited.  From ASEAN countries, may I 
propose that Brunei Darussalam -- the Former Chair, and 
Indonesia - the Incoming Chair, be the first choices. 
 
Please accept, Mr. Chairman, the renewed assurances of my 
highest consideration and best wishes. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
 
//s// Nguyen Dy Nien 
Minister for Foreign Affairs 
The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam
