¶1.  (C)  We followed up on our earlier demarche about 
canceling the upcoming exercises on Cyprus (ref A) with MFA 
Deputy DG for Greece/Cyprus Necip Eguz on Sept 29. 
PolMilCouns pressed upon Eguz the need for an early official 
GOT position in order to ensure all sides follow last year's 
precedent of reciprical cancellations.  Eguz said that Ankara 
had yet to make an "official" decision.  However, "nothing is 
different" from last year, he stated, with both MFA and TGS 
inclined to follow the past two years' precedents.  This 
meant preparations for the exercises would continue, but the 
Turkish Toros/Barbaros exercise would not occur if the 
Greek/Cypriot Toxotix/Nikiforos did not.  "Timing is on our 
side," he observed (meaning the exercises in the south are 
scheduled to occur earlier than in the north). 
 
 
¶2.  (C) Pol-Mil Counselor observed that last year there had 
been a formal agreement between the Greek and Turkish foreign 
ministers to forego the exercises (ref C).  Eguz recalled 
that that agreement occurred "at the last minute," but 
accepted that Ankara should consider how that might impact on 
the Turkish policy toward the exercises this year.  He 
undertook to consult with others within the GOT and get back 
with us. 
 
 
¶3.  (C)  Comment:  Ankara is inclined to sit and wait to see 
what the Greeks and Cypriots do before committing itself to 
cancel its exercise.  Our reminding Eguz of last year's 
bilateral understanding between Greece and Turkey may have 
prompted a review of the GOT position.  The Ambassador will 
follow up when he sees Deputy TGS Chief General Basbug on 
October 2.  We will also seek other opportunities to urge 
Turkey to cancel its exercise formally if the Greeks do the 
same.  Unfortunately, a decision before October 1 appears 
unlikely.  End comment.
