SUBJECT: UAE REITERATES A COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING OIL 
SUPPLIES 
 
 
¶1. (U) UAE Oil Minister Obaid bin Saif al-Nasseri publicly 
declared on 2/22, following a meeting with Russian Oil 
Minister Igor Yusufov, that OPEC is prepared to act 
decisively to ensure no disruption of oil supplies to world 
markets.  In remarks widely covered by the local and 
international press, Al-Nasseri told reporters, "If 
something drastic happens, then we have to take necessary 
action.  The producers will carry out their responsibility." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Al-Nasseri's statements reflect a 
continuing effort by the UAE to reduce anxiety in the oil 
market.  The UAE is well aware that the current high prices 
are not in their long-term interest, since they can serve 
only to bring additional non-OPEC supply into the market, 
thereby further eroding OPEC market share.  It thus appears 
not accidental that Al-Nasseri's remarks came after a 
meeting with Yusufov.  End comment.
