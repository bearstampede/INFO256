RECONSTRUCTION 
 
REF: A. STATE 238110 B. OTTAWA 01376 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Post delivered points contained ref A to Christopher 
Hull, DFAIT's desk officer for Iraq, on August 27. Hull 
indicated that GC representatives have not yet been in 
contact with the government of Canada, but Canada would 
receive and engage with GC representatives.  Hull said Canada 
will be unable to contribute troops to international 
stability forces in Iraq, due to its previous ISAF commitment 
in Afghanistan. He mentioned that Canada is willing to send 
personnel to help train Iraqi police forces. 
 
¶2. (C) Canada will participate in the October 23-24 donor 
conference in Spain, Hull said, and it is likely Foreign 
Minister Graham will lead Canada's delegation. As reported 
ref B, Canada has committed more than USD 200 million to date 
to humanitarian and reconstruction needs in Iraq. Hull said 
it is unlikely Canada will announce any new donations at the 
donor conference.
