(U)  Classified by PolMil Counselor Timothy A. Betts. 
Reasons:  1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
¶1.  (C)  MFA Acting DDG for Greece and Cyprus Levent Bilman 
told PolMilCouns on October 14 that after our demarche on 
UNFICYP's sighting of a Turkish AH-1W Super Cobra attack 
helicopter on September 9, MFA checked with both the Turkish 
Embassy in Nicosia and TGS.  Both denied such a flight could 
have occurred, asserting that Turkey has not dispatched 
AH-1Ws to the island since 1997.  Bilman said that after 
receiving this answer, he went back to TGS to ask about 
flight operations on September 9 and was again told that 
there were no Super Cobras on the island. 
 
 
¶2.  (C)  It was odd, Bilman continued, that neither UNFICYP 
nor the Cypriot delegation in New York had complained to 
Turkey about the alleged incident.  "Normally, they do," he 
said.  He asked that we reconfirm our information.  If there 
were no flight, he said, the incident should not be included 
in the UNFICYP renewal report.  PolMilCouns said he would 
relay the information.
