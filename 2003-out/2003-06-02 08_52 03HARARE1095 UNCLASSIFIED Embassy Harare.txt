ZANU-PF Secretary for Information and Publicity, Nathan 
Shamuyarira, has accused the United States and Britain of 
backing week-long mass protests, called by the opposition 
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to pressure Robert 
Mugabe to a negotiating table.  According to an article 
carried on page 2 in the June 2 edition of the government- 
controlled daily "The Herald," under headline "ZANU-PF 
deplores U. S., UK," Shamuyaririra - in a statement issued 
in Harare yesterday - said it was a shock that the U. S. 
and Britain were supporting a demonstration whose intention 
is to engage in a coup d'etat.  "An illegal assembly 
organizing military coup cannot be called peaceful and 
democratic.  It is shocking that the Government of Britain 
and U. S. should support such a demonstration," Shamuyarira 
is quoted as saying.
