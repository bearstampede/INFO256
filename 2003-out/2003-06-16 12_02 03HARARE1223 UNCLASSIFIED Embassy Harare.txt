  ¶1.   Under headline "Uganda must be condemned" the 
      pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated 
      its June 15 editorial to accusing Uganda of throwing 
      spanners into the peace process in the Democratic 
      Republic of Congo (DRC).  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   "The United Nations, in particular, and the 
      international community in general, need to move 
      fast in adopting a firmer stance against Kampala and 
      Yoweri Museveni over the continued crisis in the 
      DRC.  Evidence available points to the fact that 
      Uganda is deliberately sustaining the perpetuation 
      of rebel-led war in the DRC. . .That Uganda was part 
      of the process that led to the war in DRC in the 
      late 1990s is an indictment enough.  Continuing with 
      such perverted activities should be condemned in the 
      strongest terms.  What is particularly irking is 
      that the U. S. administration keeps praising 
      Museveni as an African role model, despite the 
      gruesome revelations.  The U. N. should also move 
      away from its tendency to just criticize, and take 
      more concrete action."
