SUBJECT: GOT CONTINUES TO DELAY ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT

¶1. (U) Action request--para 3. 
 
 
¶2. (C) Feza Ozturk, head of the MFA International Political 
Organizations Department, told us April 7 the MFA has put its 
consideration of a draft bilateral Article 98 agreement on 
hold.  Ozturk attributed the hold to "the situation in Iraq." 
 He averred that the MFA supports an agreement in principle, 
but does not want to expose the GOT to speculation about why 
it is signing such an agreement during the war.  We responded 
that the USG is looking for areas of cooperation it can point 
to in its relationship with Turkey.  Ozturk replied that MFA 
DG for Multilateral Political Affairs Batibay has decided 
against signing an agreement until after the conflict in 
Iraq. 
 
 
¶3. (C) Comment and action request: Once again the GOT has 
given a reason to delay an agreement.  Until such time as EU 
members begin to accept agreements we believe Turkey will 
continue to avoid concluding an agreement with us.  A 
sustained, high-level effort might gain traction, but we 
would welcome information on the status of Article 98 
discussions with the EU and leading EU members.
