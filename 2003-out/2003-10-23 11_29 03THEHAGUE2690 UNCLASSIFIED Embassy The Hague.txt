MFA Head of UN Political and Judicial Affairs Pieter Ramaer 
confirmed that the GoNL will support the Canadian candidate 
in the upcoming INCB special election on October 31.  The 
GoNL chose to support Canada because the GoNL and GoC have 
similar domestic drug policies, and the two countries 
maintain a close cooperation on narcotics issues.
