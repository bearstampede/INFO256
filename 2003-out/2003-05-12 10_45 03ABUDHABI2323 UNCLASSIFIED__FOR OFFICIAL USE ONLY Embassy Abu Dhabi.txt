SUBJECT: LABOR MINISTRY MEDIATES STRIKE IN DUBAI 
 
REF: ABU DHABI 1935 AND PREVIOUS 
 
(SBU) The local press reported that the Labor Ministry 
mediated a strike between eight hundred laborers and a 
construction firm in Dubai over the non-payment of 
wages. The Ministry dispatched a team to review the 
workers' complaint and negotiated a settlement 
providing for immediate payment of a portion of the 
unpaid amount with the balance to be paid in monthly 
installments in addition to regular salary. Such work 
stoppages continue to occur periodically in both Abu 
Dhabi and Dubai, and though technically not sanctioned 
by law, Ministry officials generally review non- 
payment cases sympathetically.  (See reftel). In 
addition to these informal dispute resolution 
mechanisms, the government is also proceeding with 
legislation permitting the creation of unions.
