     ¶B. THE HAGUE 2142 
 
¶1.  Summary: The GoNL plans to provide USD 833,300 in 
materiel to Iraqi police in the Al-Munthanna province in 
Iraq.  Dutch military police, as part of Dutch military 
forces deployed in Al-Muthanna, are currently providing 
one-week basic police skills training courses to local 
police.  The Dutch previously provided a list of experts to 
the World Bank.  However, the GoNL does not wish to be viewed 
as an integral participant in the CPA, and hence will neither 
provide civil servant experts nor funding for private Dutch 
citizens to serve as advisors/trainers for the reconstruction 
of the Iraqi police, justice and prison sectors.  The Dutch 
have no opposition to private citizens assisting the CPA. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2.  The GoNL currently has approximately 1,100 servicemen 
deployed in the southern Iraqi province of Al-Munthanna 
conducting stabilization operations as part of the UK 
division.  In connection with this deployment, Dutch military 
police (the Royal Marechaussee) are providing a one-week, 
basic training course to local police in Al-Munthanna. 
According to MOD sources, this training includes lectures on 
the appropriate use of weapons, simple investigation and 
report writing.  In combination with the Dutch military 
presence in Iraq, the Dutch CIMIC (Civilian-Military 
Cooperation) team working in Iraq requested funding 
(subsequently approved) for approximately USD 833,300 in 
materiel for the Iraqi police force in Al-Muthanna.  Funding 
will be spent as follows:

(Note:  The GoNL is still in the process of determining how 
best to purchase much of the above materiel.  For example, 
they have yet to decide if it would be better/easier to 
purchase the weapons directly from the CPA, or locally here 
in the Netherlands.  End Note.) 
 
¶3. The GoNL does not want to be viewed as a part of the CPA 
("occupying power") in Iraq in order to maintain domestic 
support for the current Dutch military deployment as well as 
other funding to Iraq (ref b).  Therefore, the GoNL will not 
contribute any civil servants nor provide funding for private 
citizens to assist in CPA-led training in the police, justice 
and prison sectors.  The Dutch previously provided a list of 
experts to the World Bank upon request, and does not oppose 
the use of Dutch experts by the World Bank as needed in Iraq.
