SUBJECT: WASHINGTON BASED IRAQI DIPLOMATS STRESS IMPROVED 
SECURITY AS KEY TO IRAQI STABILITY 
 
 
Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) PolOff met December 8 with two Washington bound Iraqi 
diplomats assigned to the Iraqi Interests Section.  Both 
cited the critical need for improved security in Iraq to gain 
popular support for the U.S. presence.  The diplomats said 
many Iraqis resent Jordan's support for Saddam and believe 
Jordan profited unfairly from the relationship. End Summary. 
 
------------------ 
HARDSHIPS AND HOPE 
------------------ 
 
¶2. (C) PolOff met December 8 with two Iraqi diplomats, Faiz 
Al-Gailani and Faris Abdul Wahab, transiting through Jordan 
on their way to their posts at the Iraqi Interests Section in 
Washington, D.C.  PolOff queried the men about daily life in 
Baghdad and how average Iraqis are coping.  Al-Gailani 
answered that while there exists a semblance of "normalcy" in 
Baghdad, evidenced by shops remaining open until 10:30 p.m. 
and people going about their daily business, most Iraqis try 
to be home before darkness falls as a precautionary measure. 
He added that electricity service, although improved, 
continues to be cut throughout the day.  According to 
Al-Gailani, everyone leaves their lights on, even during the 
day, since electricity continues to be free until the CPA 
decides on a viable billing system.  Al-Gailani and Wahab 
both stated that gasoline continues to be in short supply due 
to pipeline sabotage and, allegedly, Iraqi tankers driving to 
the Syrian and Turkish borders to sell their supplies at 
substantial profits. 
 
---------------------------- 
SECURITY, SECURITY, SECURITY 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Al-Gailani stressed that until the security situation 
is stabilized, Iraqis will continue to feel lukewarm about 
the U.S. presence.  He added that average Iraqis often say 
they prefer security over an improved financial situation. 
"What good is money if you can't venture out and enjoy it?" 
Al-Gailani believes that Saddam loyalists are not directly 
responsible for all of the attacks against coalition forces, 
but opined that they are paying Iraqis to carry out such 
attacks and added that each type of attack carries a 
corresponding price.  For example, a bombing attack will cost 
one price, while a shooting will carry a different price tag. 
 
----------------------------- 
MORE POLICE VISIBILITY NEEDED 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Al-Gailani praised the visibility of Iraqi police, 
especially at night, but added that more are needed.  He 
suggested an increased police presence outside the major 
cities.  He underscored that Iraq is not in a "normal" 
situation and thus the police must be better armed and drive 
armored vehicles.  Al-Gailani stressed that the CPA should 
make the establishment of a sophisticated intelligence 
service a top priority, yet cautioned that the CPA would 
never be able to do the job as well as the Iraqis themselves. 
 He said the intelligence service must draw on the expertise 
and knowledge held by Iraqi political parties since they are 
familiar with Saddam's operatives and henchmen. 
 
----------------------------- 
TRIBES CAN HELP WITH SECURITY 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. (C) Al-Gailani stressed that Iraq's tribes can play a 
significant role in aiding the CPA on security issues.  He 
added that Saddam "retribalized" Iraqi society during his 
reign as a way of exerting more control over them.  However, 
he cautioned, tribes should never be above the law or allowed 
to gain a foothold in the new Iraq. 
 
--------------------------- 
IRAQI MEDIA NEEDS UPGRADING 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) Both Al-Gailani and Abdul Wahab criticized the poor 
state of Iraqi media and deplored how Saudi-owned satellite 
t.v. Al Arabiya only focuses on the negative aspects in Iraq 
while ignoring anything of a positive nature.  They accused 
Al Arabiya of paying Iraqi children to shout anti-U.S. 
slogans when the cameras are on as well as the way the 
station cuts any interview in which an Iraqi praises the U.S. 
presence in Iraq. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
ELECTIONS, MONARCHY and IRAQ-JORDAN RELATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (C) Al-Gailani believes that holding elections without 
security would be a disaster and opined that if Iraqis do not 
feel secure, they will not participate in nationwide 
elections.  Al-Gailani said that a monarchy has no place in 
Iraq and that it would be a step backward.  When queried 
about Iraq-Jordan relations, he responded that Iraqis are 
well aware of how Jordan profited from the Saddam regime, at 
their expense.  He said Iraqis remember the inferiority of 
Jordanian products such as medicines and household goods.  He 
believes the onus is on Jordan to work on improving 
relations.  Iraqis are tired of wars and animosity, 
Al-Gailani said, and hope for a new beginning and future with 
their Arab neighbors.  Both men agreed that educated Iraqis 
feel hopeful for the first time about their futures and 
believe that a silent majority hopes that U.S. forces will 
remain until Iraqis are able to govern themselves.
