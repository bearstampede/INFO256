  ¶1.   Under the headline "Time to curb U.S. bully tactics" 
      the government-controlled weekly "The Sunday Mail" (03/23) 
      an  opinion article by the newspaper's Political Editor, 
      Munyaradzi Huni.  Huni accuses the United States and 
      Britain of leading a campaign "to spread imperialism." 
      Excerpts follow: 
 
  ¶2.   "My heart bleeds for the people of Iraq.  May the 
      powerful and all-conquering God see to it that good 
      triumphs over evil.  But, if I may ask: `What the 
      hell does the U.S. think it is anyway. . .?'  Over 
      300,000 U.S.-led forces are already reducing Iraq to 
      ashes. . .not only to remove Saddam Hussein from 
      power but to spread imperialism in that region. 
      America knows that defeating Saddam Hussein is the 
      first and biggest step in conquering the Moslems 
      around the world.  All the talk about weapons of 
      mass destruction is just propaganda to justify the 
      killing of innocent lives in Iraq.  Mr. Blair knows 
      the price for not supporting America. . .  If 
      Britain fails to support America, Mr. Blair knows 
      that once Mr. Bush finishes the project in other 
      countries, the guns will be turned on his country. 
      So while Iraq is thousands of kilometers away, what 
      is happening there could happen to Zimbabwe because 
      the reasons why they are bombing Iraq are the same 
      reasons why they imposed sanctions against Zimbabwe. 
      It's all about spreading this new kind of 
      colonialism. . .  Once they finish the project in 
      Iraq. . .Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair are likely to turn 
      their attention to North Korea, another country they 
      accuse of having weapons of mass destruction.  After 
      North Korea, no one really knows where the bombs 
      will be pounding, but one thing that is certain is 
      that Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair's efforts to spread 
      imperialism will continue because their madness and 
      hunger to rule the world knows no bounds.  Isn't it 
      time this madness is put to a quick stop. . . ."
