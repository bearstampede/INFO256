SUBJECT:  UAE QUIETLY SUPPORTS THE IRAQ GOVERNING COUNCIL 
 
REF: A) STATE 215824, B) STATE 202537 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by A/DCM Katherine Van De Vate for 
reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2. (C) The Ambassador met with both Abu Dhabi Crown Prince 
Khalifa Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan and Minister Of State for 
Foreign Affairs Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan to urge that the 
UAEG support the Iraq Governing Council.  Both have 
stressed the UAEG's support of the council.  Abu Dhabi's 
ruling family has also been a long time supporter of 
council member Adnan Pachachi and receives regular 
briefings from him about Iraq. 
 
¶3. (C) Given the summer holidays and the absence of 
President Zayed, we are unlikely to see any sort of 
official public statement from the UAEG.
