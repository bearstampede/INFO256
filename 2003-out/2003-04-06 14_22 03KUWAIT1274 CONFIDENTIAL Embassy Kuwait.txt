REF: KUWAIT 1232 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbancic for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) 
 
¶1. (C) Detailed oil production for Kuwait Oil Company was not 
available today, but production likely remains just under 2.4 
million barrels. 
 
¶2. (C) EconChief had a chance to visit the two wells in the 
Rumeila field of Southern Iraq that continue burning.  One 
well is burning crude oil, emitting a plume of thick black 
smoke.  The KOC firefighting team is on site at the well. 
KOC had earlier tried to extinguish the fire using water from 
trucks, but ran out of water before the fire was put out. 
They have now dug a lagoon which they had filled with water, 
and preparations for another attempt were being made as of 
the early afternoon.  If successful, the fire would be out by 
sundown. 
 
¶3. (C) The other well is burning gas, with a very hot flame 
but a much cleaner smoke plume.  Boots and Coots (B and C) 
officials told EconChief that once KOC had its fire out, 
water trucks would focus on filling the lagoon B and C had 
dug.  Once filled, B and C would then begin efforts to 
control the second well.  If all goes according to plan, the 
two fires could be out by Monday or Tuesday. 
 
¶4. (U) Local Arabic press today reported that the KOC will 
suspend its operations in Iraq after the two fires still 
burning in Rumeila are extinguished, leaving any remaining or 
new fires to B and C.
