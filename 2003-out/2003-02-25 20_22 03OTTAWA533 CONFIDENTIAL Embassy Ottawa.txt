SUBJECT: CANADA ON IAEA DG EL BARADEI'S VISIT TO IRAN 
 
REF: STATE 46864 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Mary Witt, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Canada shares our strong concerns over Iran's nuclear 
program (reftel), and will continue pushing for a tough 
approach to Tehran by the IAEA.  Terry Wood, Foreign Affairs 
Deputy Director for Non-Proliferation, told us on February 21 
that Canada believes Iran is technically in breach of its 
safeguards agreement.  Wood agreed with virtually all of the 
arguments laid out in reftel, and said that the point about 
Iran being the only affected country failing to declare new 
facilities was particularly useful.  Canadian officials in 
Tehran and in Vienna are closely following El Baradei's visit 
to Iran. 
 
¶2. (C) Wood said that if Iran were to now declare all of its 
facilities, including pilot enrichment experiments, then that 
would be a significant step forward.  But if Iran was serious 
about being taken at its word, he continued, it would have 
come forward long ago to address international concerns. 
Wood said that the IAEA safeguards operation division that 
covers Iran is also responsible for Canada, and that this 
division is well informed on what Iran is doing.  He observed 
that El Baradei was trying to do whatever he could to get 
Iran to come clean, even suggesting that Iran report 
undeclared material to the IAEA Board as a minor 
irregularity. 
 
¶3. (C) Wood assured us that Canada will take every 
opportunity to press Iran on this issue, both bilaterally and 
multilaterally.  He noted that Iran is closely following the 
IAEA's approach to North Korea, and that Canada had Iran in 
mind, too, as it pushed for IAEA action on the DPRK.
