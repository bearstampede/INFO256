SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GON STILL UNCERTAIN ABOUT TAYLOR'S 
DEPARTURE 
 
 
Classified By Charge Dawn Liberi. Reasons 1.5 (b) AND (d). 
 
 
¶1. (C) During an August 7 conversation with A/DCM, 
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs expressed 
concern that Charles Taylor may try to renege on his 
implied promise to leave Liberia on August 11.  The 
Minister realized that Taylor had only expressly 
stated that he would step down on that date but 
everyone was working to an August 11 departing as 
well. 
 
 
¶2. (C) A/DCM advised that the GON should send an 
emissary to Monrovia to confer with Liberian Minister 
of State Jonathan Taylor to begin actual logistical 
preparations for Taylor departure.  Minister Samaila 
then called the Minister for Cooperation and African 
Integration asking him to seek provision from 
President Obasanjo to go to Monrovia to undertake this 
task with Liberian Minister of State.
