SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR REAPPORTIOMENT OF FMF 
 
¶1.  During the recent visit of the PACOM J4, Brigadier 
General James Kennon to Colombo, Post learned that India may 
not accept five million dollars in Foreign Military Funding 
(FMF) from the US government for a variety of reasons.  If 
India does in fact not need the FMF, Post requests 
consideration of reapportionment of the five million into 
Sri Lanka's FMF account.  Post's original request for 15 
million of FMF in support of programs recommended by the 
2002 US DoD assessments was reduced to 1 million in the 
final interagency. 
 
¶2.  The five million dollars of FMF would go a long way to 
strengthening the Sri Lankan military in the face of the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a State Department Foreign 
Declared Terrorist Organization.  As combatting terrorism is 
a national level and PACOM priority, assistance to the Sri 
Lankan military in containing LTTE terrorists in Sri Lanka 
supports Post's Mission plan and PACOM's theater Security 
Cooperation plan.
