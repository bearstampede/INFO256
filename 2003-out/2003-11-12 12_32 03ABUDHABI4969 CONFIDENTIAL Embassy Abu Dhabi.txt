SUBJECT:  UAEG REACTION TO POTUS DEMOCRACY 
SPEECH 
 
Ref: Abu Dhabi 4903 
 
(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, 
Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶1. (C) The UAEG has no plans to react publicly 
to President George Bush's speech on democracy 
in the Middle East region, Ibrahim Al-Abed, the 
senior adviser to Information and Culture 
Minister Shaykh Abdallah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, 
told Polchief November 12.  Al-Abed was quick to 
add that while Emiratis are generally pleased 
with the current political system, they are not 
shy about debating change.  "As far as Emiratis 
are concerned, the speech will go away. 
However, the debate is open in the UAE.  Change 
is on people's minds," he said. 
 
¶2. (C) Al-Abed told Polchief that Emiratis at 
all levels do not like it when change is 
dictated or preached to them by outsiders.  This 
is particularly so in times of crisis when 
people are preoccupied with the situation of 
Arabs in Iraq and in the West Bank/Gaza.  "One 
right move" by the U.S. with regard to occupied 
lands in West Bank/Gaza would make a bigger 
difference than any speech, said Al-Abed, who is 
originally from Palestine.  In this respect, Al- 
Abed echoed much of the local press sentiment 
reported in reftel.  Emiratis also believe in 
gradualism and are not going to change their 
political system overnight, Al-Abed said. 
Polchief learned from Khadim Al-Darei, the 
deputy manager for de facto Foreign Minister 
Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, that Shaykh 
Hamdan had reviewed President Bush's speech. 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT:  We do not expect an official 
public response to the President's speech.  In 
our view, that would be unusual.
