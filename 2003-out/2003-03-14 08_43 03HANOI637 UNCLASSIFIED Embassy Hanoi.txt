¶1.  (U)  MFA International Organizations department expert 
Hong Bich Lien confirmed to poloff on March 13 that Nguyen 
Vu Viet, Nguyen Truc Cuong, and Nguyen Thi Hoa, whom reports 
have described as nephews and niece of Father Nguyen Van Ly, 
have been arrested and are under investigation.  They will 
reportedly be brought to trial on charges related to 
destroying public offices and public vehicles.  This account 
contradicts reports from an activist group that the three 
were convicted of espionage on October 24, 2002. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Ms. Lien assured poloff that Le Chi Quang, 
currently serving a four year sentence, is receiving 
treatment for his liver condition, including weekly checkups 
in the prison clinic and required prescription medicine. 
Lien denied reports that Quang was not taking his medicine 
because he did not know what it was.  She also insisted that 
Quang had access to adequate sanitary facilities and did not 
have to relieve himself in a bucket. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Poloff followed up on September and November 2002 
inquiries about reported Father Nguyen Van Ly follower, 
Hoang Trang Dung, but Ms. Lien indicated that she had no 
information about him or Father Ly himself. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Poloff asked for any new information on the other 
persons of concern raised at the last U.S.-Vietnam Human 
Rights Dialogue and furnished Ms. Lien another copy of the 
list.  Ms. Lien scanned the list, but had no updates. 
Poloff and Ms. Lien agreed to follow up on the list in early 
May after Lien returns from the 59th UNHRC.
