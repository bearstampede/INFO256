¶1.  (sbu)  Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Mohammed 
Batayneh confirmed on June 12 press reports that the GOJ had 
reached agreement with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE on a 
3-month extension to the deal reached prior to the war to 
supply Jordan with concessional oil.  Batayneh said the deal 
would continue to be for 100,000 bpd equivalent, NOT/NOT 
120,000 bpd as reported in the press.  Batayneh said the 
terms of the deal would remain as before, with Saudi Arabia 
supplying 50,000 bpd of crude, Kuwait 25,000 bpd, and the UAE 
the cash equivalent of 25,000 bpd. 
 
¶2.  (sbu)  Comment:  100,000 bpd is roughly equivalent to 
Jordan's consumption needs.  There would be little, if any, 
excess oil imported into Jordan under the extended deal, with 
any excess most likely being represented by unused cash from 
the Emirates' contribution rather than unused crude.  End 
comment.
