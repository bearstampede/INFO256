SUBJECT: LAWYER SEEKS COURT ORDER FOR RETURN OF EXPELLED 
JOURNALIST 
 
 
  ¶1.   Beatrice Mtetwa, lawyer for expelled U.S. citizen 
      journalist Andrew Meldrum, has filed an application in the 
      High Court seeking the return of her client, expelled on 
      May 16.  The application, filed on May 21, seeks a ruling 
      that would compel Home Affairs Minister Kembo Mohadi, Chief 
      Immigration Office, Elasto Mugwadi, and Evan Siziba, a 
      senior immigration officer, to "ensure Meldrum's return or 
      face jail."  Mtetwa also wants the trio to "pay for the 
      costs incurred by her client as a direct result of their 
      actions, from their pockets. . ." 
 
  ¶2.   Mtetwa is also seeking a High Court order to force the 
      GoZ Comptroller and Auditor General to deduct the money 
      directly from the salaries of Mohadi, Mugwadi and Siziba, 
      and to provide the court with proof of those deductions.
