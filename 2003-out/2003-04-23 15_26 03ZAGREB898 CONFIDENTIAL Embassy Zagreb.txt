¶1.  (C) SPLIT, CROATIA'S SECOND-LARGEST CITY, SHOULD BE A 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUCCESS STORY.  BUT EVEN THOUGH CITY 
REVENUES ARE UP, DEBTS HAVE BEEN RETIRED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE 
AND A SERIES OF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS ARE PLANNED, 
SPLIT'S LEADERS ARE A STEP AWAY FROM DISBANDING THE 
MULTI-PARTY CITY GOVERNMENT.  THE PROBLEM IS NATIONAL-LEVEL 
POLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP MIXED WITH THE DESIRE OF SOME LOCAL 
POLITICIANS TO GET THEIR SLICES OF THE PATRONAGE PIE.  UNLESS 
A COMPLICATED DEAL IS CUT, THE COALITION GOVERNMENT IN SPLIT 
COULD FALL, EMBARRASSING NATIONAL-LEVEL LEADERS AS THEY 
PREPARE FOR ELECTIONS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (C) A LOCAL-LEVEL POWER-SHARING DEAL BROKERED IN FEBRUARY 
2002 BETWEEN THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDP) AND THE 
CROATIAN SOCIAL LIBERAL PARTY (HSLS) CALLS FOR SPLIT MAYOR 
SLOBODAN BEROS (SDP) TO STEP DOWN AT THE END OF THE SUMMER 
AND HAND THE KEYS OF THE CITY TO HSLS DEPUTY MAYOR MIROSLAV 
BULICIC.  WHEN THE HSLS BROKE APART IN JULY 2002 AT THE 
NATIONAL LEVEL (AFTER PARTY PRESIDENT DRAZEN BUDISA LEFT THE 
GOVERNMENT), THE SDP-HSLS COALITION IN SPLIT REMAINED IN 
PLACE.  NOW BUDISA IS TRYING TO FORCE THE HSLS MEMBERS OF THE 
CITY GOVERNMENT TO RESIGN AND FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT WITH THE 
NATIONALIST OPPOSITION HDZ. 
 
¶3.  (C) THE LOCAL HSLS IS DIVIDED EVENLY BETWEEN THOSE LOYAL 
TO THE NATIONAL-LEVEL PARTY AND THOSE WHO WANT TO STAY IN 
OFFICE WITH THE SDP.  BULICIC TOLD US THAT VOTERS ELECTED 
HSLS TOGETHER WITH SDP AND WOULD NEVER FORGIVE THEM IF THEY 
FORMED A COALITION WITH HDZ.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, ASSERTED 
BULICIC, THE CITY GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN A RESOUNDING SUCCESS: 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

THE CITY'S WAR-ERA DEBT HAS BEEN FULLY RETIRED (AHEAD OF 
SCHEDULE), UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN, CITY SERVICES ARE PERFORMING 
AT TOP LEVELS, CITY TAX REVENUES ARE ABOVE EXPECTATIONS AND 
THE GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING SEVERAL IMPORTANT NEW 
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS BEGINNING THIS FALL. 
 
¶4.  (C) BULICIC ALSO HAS HIS OWN PERSONAL MOTIVATIONS.  TO 
BECOME MAYOR, HE MUST FIRST STEP DOWN AS DEPUTY MAYOR AND 
RESUME HIS SEAT ON THE CITY COUNCIL.  WHEN HE DOES THIS, HE 
WILL ALSO HAVE TO STEP DOWN AS HEAD OF SPLIT CITY SANITATION, 
A WELL-PAYING JOB WITH PLENTY OF PATRONAGE POSITIONS AT HIS 
DISPOSAL.  BULICIC HOPES TO OFFSET THIS LOSS OF LUCRE BY 
INSISTING THAT THE SDP GIVE HIM THE POSITION OF DIRECTOR OF 
"PLOVPUT," THE STATE-LEVEL ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBLE FOR 
MAINTAINING NAVIGATIONAL AIDS IN CROATIA'S INLAND WATERS. 
(SINCE THIS IS A STATE-LEVEL APPOINTMENT, THERE WOULD BE NO 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH HIS POSITION AS CITY COUNCILOR.) 
 
¶5.  (C) SDP OFFICIALS ARE EXASPERATED AT BULICIC'S BLATANT 
INSISTENCE AT BEING COMPENSATED FOR HIS LOSS OF INCOME (CITY 
COUNCILORS RECEIVE NO SALARY).  THEY POINT OUT THAT SINCE THE 
MAYOR'S JOB IS A FULL-TIME PAID POSITION, BULICIC WOULD HAVE 
TO RESIGN ONCE HE LEAVES THE COUNCIL TO BECOME MAYOR. 
BULICIC MAY BRING DOWN THE CITY GOVERNMENT JUST FOR A FEW 
MONTHS' INCOME AS HEAD OF PLOVPUT.  "WHEN IT COMES TO 
POLITICS IN CROATIA, GOOD PERFORMANCE JUST IS NOT ONE OF THE 
CRITERIA USED TO DECIDE WHO SERVES," EXPLAINED VELJAN 
RADOJKOVIC, WHO SERVES AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
NATIONAL-LEVEL GOVERNMENT IN SPLIT-DALMATIA COUNTY. 
 
¶6.  (C) MARIN JURJEVIC, A LEADING SDP MP WHO IS ALSO THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00898  01 OF 02  231534Z 
CHAIR OF THE SPLIT SDP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, ADMITTED THAT 
BULICIC HAS COALITION PARTIES OVER A BARREL.  THE CITY 
GOVERNMENT HAS DONE A POOR JOB OF BLOWING ITS OWN HORN; AS 
WITH THE REST OF CROATIA, MOST RESIDENTS ARE DISSATISFIED 
WITH THEIR GOVERNMENT.  WITH ELECTIONS EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE 
IN THE FALL, THE LOSS OF CROATIA'S SECOND CITY WOULD BE 
DIFFICULT TO RECOVER FROM.  JURJEVIC TOLD US HE GUARANTEED 
BULICIC THE MAYOR POSITION, BUT HAS NOT (YET) GIVEN IN ON THE 
ASSIGNMENT TO PLOVPUT. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7.  (C) HSLS PRESIDENT BUDISA IS DESPERATE TO BRING DOWN THE 
SPLIT GOVERNMENT AND HAS ALREADY SHOWN HE IS READY TO HIT 
BELOW THE BELT TO ACHIEVE THAT OUTCOME.  UNDER HIS 
LEADERSHIP, HSLS WENT FROM BEING THE SECOND-LARGEST POLITICAL 
PARTY IN THE COALITION TO THE BRINK OF POLITICAL IRRELEVANCE. 
 HE SEEKS TO SABOTAGE THE COALITION'S ABILITY TO TAKE CREDIT 
FOR SPLIT'S SUCCESS AND INCREASE THE VALUE OF HIS PARTY IN A 
POTENTIAL COALITION WITH THE HDZ.  THE SDP WANTS TO KEEP 
SPLIT -- THE ONLY CITY WHERE THEY ARE IN GOVERNMENT IN 
NATIONALIST-LEANING DALMATIA -- ON THEIR SIDE.
