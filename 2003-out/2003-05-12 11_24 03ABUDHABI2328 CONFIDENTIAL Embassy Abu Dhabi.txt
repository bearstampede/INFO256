¶1.  (U) Classified by Charge D'Affaires Richard A. 
Albright, for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C) Charge presented reftel points on lifting UNSC 
sanctions on Iraq to MFA Assistant U/S Abdullah Rashid Al- 
Nuaimi, May 12.  Al-Nuaimi said that the UAE fully supports 
the lifting of sanctions and remarked, "The regime is gone 
so sanctions should be gone too."  The most important thing 
for the UAE, he commented, is to improve as quickly as 
possible the condition of the Iraqi people -- something 
that would best be served by an immediate lifting of 
sanctions.
