REF: ZAGREB 409 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR LAWRENCE ROSSIN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B.D) 
 
¶1.  (C) ON FEBRUARY 26, THE CROATIAN CABINET PASSED A FORMAL 
DECISION (TEXT AT PARA 5 BELOW) TO AGREE TO A USG REQUEST FOR 
THE USE OF CROATIAN AIRSPACE AND AIRFIELDS BY COMMERCIAL 
AIRCRAFT FOR REFUELING AND STOPOVER IN SUPPORT OF MILITARY 
OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AGAINST IRAQ.  THE DECISION 
CREATES AN INTER-AGENCY WORKING GROUP, TO BE CHAIRED BY AN 
ASSISTANT MINISTER OF DEFENSE, WHICH WILL IMPLEMENT AND 
MONITOR ACTIVITIES UNDER THE DECISION.  ALTHOUGH THE DECISION 
GOES INTO EFFECT ON FEBRUARY 26, IT MAY TAKE AS LONG AS TWO 
WEEKS FOR THE WORKING GROUP TO BE FORMALLY ESTABLISHED; 
CROATIA WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR 
FLIGHTS UNTIL THAT TAKES PLACE. 
 
¶2.  (C) THIS DECISION WAS PRESENTED TO THE PARLIAMENT 
PRECISELY AS PM RACAN TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON FEBRUARY 24 IT 
WOULD BE (REFTEL).  AT THE SABOR'S VERSION OF "QUESTION TIME" 
ON FEBRUARY 26, RACAN TOLD MP'S THAT THE DECISION WAS TAKEN 
"WITH THE UNDERSTANDING" OF EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS WHICH ARE 
DECIDING ON CROATIA'S EU MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION.  RACAN ALSO 
SAID THAT CROATIA'S OFFER OF LOGISTICS SUPPORT WAS A 
MINIMALIST POSITION.  "SOME COUNTRIES WHICH ARE AGAINST THE 
APPROACH OF THE UNITED STATES ARE PROVIDING MORE LOGISTICS 
SUPPORT THAN WE ARE OFFERING," RACAN EXPLAINED.  RACAN 
INSISTED THAT THE DECISION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT IS WITHIN 
THE COMPETENCE OF THE CABINET, BUT ANY REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL 
SUPPORT WOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE PARLIAMENT, AS REQUIRED BY 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

CROATIAN LAW. 
 
¶3.  (C) IN A FEBRUARY 25 MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, 
PRESIDENT MESIC WAS MORE SUPPORTIVE OF U.S. POLICIES/REQUESTS 
ON IRAQ THAN WE EXPECTED, CONSIDERING SOME OF HIS RECENT 
STATEMENTS TO THE LOCAL PRESS.  MESIC SAID THAT HE SUPPORTS 
THE GOC DECISION TO AGREE TO THE USG REQUEST FOR LANDING 
RIGHTS IN CROATIA.  HE SAID THAT HE RAISED THE ISSUE DURING 
HIS JANUARY 24 MEETING IN PARIS WITH PRESIDENT CHIRAC, WHO 
CHARACTERIZED CROATIA'S DECISION TO PROVIDE FLOW-THROUGH 
ACCESS AS APPROPRIATE. 
 
¶4.  (C) IN A FEBRUARY 25 MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR, DEFMIN 
ANTUNOVIC SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECISION WOULD APPROVE OUR 
REQUEST WITH VERY NARROW PARAMETERS; ANY REQUEST BEYOND 
AIRSPACE, LANDING AND REFUELING WOULD HAVE TO BE TAKEN TO THE 
PARLIAMENT.  CROATIA'S DEFENSE LAW REQUIRES SABOR APPROVAL 
BEFORE THE ENTRY OF ANY FOREIGN TROOPS INTO CROATIA.  THE GOC 
INTERPRETATION IS THAT THE SABOR WOULD HAVE TO APPROVE IN 
ADVANCE -- WITH A TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY -- IF A U.S. SOLDIER IS 
TO SET FOOT ON CROATIAN SOIL.  UNDER THE CURRENT DECISION, 
TROOPS WILL HAVE TO REMAIN ON BOARD THE AIRCRAFT DURING 
REFUELING.  IN THE CASE OF AN AIRCRAFT BREAKDOWN, THE GOC 
COULD OFFER OVERNIGHT STAYS WITHOUT OVERSTEPPING ITS LEGAL 
BOUNDARIES.  SUCH A CASE WOULD BE DECLARED AN EMERGENCY STOP 
UNDER ICAO RULES AND THE GOC WOULD BE LEGALLY COVERED.

THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
