ATTENDING MINISTERS ADDRESS SEVERAL QUESTIONS IN THE 
PRESENTATION OF THEIR NATIONAL ACTION PLANS FOR BROADBAND 
DEPLOYMENT: 
 
      - THE STATUS OF NATIONAL BROADBAND DEVELOPMENT, 
OBSTACLES TO ITS DEVELOPMENT, THE MAIN INITIATIVES STATES 
PLAN TO ADOPT TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF BROADBAND 
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE LEVEL OF COMPETITION BETWEEN 
INCUMBENTS AND NEW ENTRANTS IN THE BROADBAND INDUSTRY; 
 
      - THE PREFERRED WAY TO USE STRUCTURAL FUNDS, WITH 
PARTICULAR ATTENTION ON REDUCING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN BOTH 
MEMBER AND APPLICANT STATES.

¶4. (U) COMMENT:  THE INFORMATION PAPER IS VAGUE IN ITS 
DEFINITION OF BROADBAND, A TERM THAT IS USED TO REFER TO A 
    RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES OF DIFFERENT CAPACITIES AND SPEEDS FOR 
THE DELIVERY OF DATA COMMUNICATION SERVICES, INCLUDING HYBRID 
FIBER COAX TECHNOLOGY (HFC) AND DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER LINE (DSL) 
SERVICE, AS WELL AS WIRELESS DATA TRANSMISSION.  GIVEN THE 
DIVERSE SET OF BROADBAND TECHNOLOGIES, THE RAPID PACE OF 
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND THE VARIETY OF ENTITIES PROVIDING 
VARIOUS BROADBAND SERVICES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF EU-WIDE 
BROADBAND INITIATIVES, POLICIES AND REGULATIONS IS LIKELY TO 
BE A LENGTHY PROCESS. END COMMENT.
