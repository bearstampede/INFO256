Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
¶1. (U) Ref A article in the Thai daily Bangkok Siam Rat 
(titled "Rumor Says Suu Kyi Dead; Dream of Democracy 
Shattered") reported on rumors that an assailant recently 
stabbed detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to death. 
 Although there are many uncertainties regarding ASSK,s 
current whereabouts and well being, we have no credible 
information that she has been killed or otherwise harmed. 
 
¶2. (C) As we reported in ref B, the ICRC met with ASSK on 
July 28 and observed her to be in good health.   We have 
subsequently learned that, in accordance with Burmese laws 
pertaining to political detainees, ASSK supporters have been 
able to supply her with weekly deliveries of food and 
clothing through military intelligence intermediaries.   Her 
supporters believe that she has been receiving these 
deliveries, although they have been denied direct access to 
her.   Asked to comment about rumors of her death, a senior 
Ministry of Defense official told Emboff on August 11 that 
ASSK was "alive, eating regularly, and even gaining weight." 
 
¶3. (U) Comment:  Without direct access to Aung San Suu Kyi, 
we cannot report with certainty on her current status. 
However, the SPDC maintains an intensely secretive posture 
with regard to her "protective custody" and the status of all 
NLD members detained in the aftermath of the May 30 attack on 
her convoy.  As a result, we fully expect that rumors about 
her state of health will continue to flourish.
