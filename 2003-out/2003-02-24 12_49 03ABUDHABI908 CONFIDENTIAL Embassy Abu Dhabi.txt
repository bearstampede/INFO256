SUBJECT: SECRETARY'S ORAL MESSAGE ON IRAQ 
ISSUES AND NAM DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
REF:  A) STATE 47832 
 
      B) STATE 47493 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) The Ambassador delivered Ref A oral message 
from the Secretary and Ref B NAM demarche on Iraq to 
MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayid AL-Nahyan on 
2/22.  Noting the upcoming Arab League, Islamic 
Conference and NAM summits, the Ambassador 
underscored the need to keep Iraq focused on full 
compliance with UNSCR 1441.  Hamdan assured that the 
UAE would stand firm, but predicted that other 
countries, particularly Syria, may seek statements 
critical of the U.S.  Syria's strong-arm tactics at 
what Hamdan termed as last week's "disastrous" Arab 
League ministerial in Cairo, had not been well- 
received in many Arab capitals. 
 
¶3. (C) Hamdan briefed that visiting PLO Secretary 
General and Arafat Deputy Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) 
understood from his recent visit to Moscow that the 
Russians were "98 percent" resigned to the fact that 
the USG would move militarily against Iraq.  In Abu 
Mazen's view, the Russians would not prevent the 
attack (i.e. exercise their UNSC veto option). 
 
¶4. (C) According to Hamdan, Fujairah Ruler Hamad Al- 
Sharqi will represent the UAE at the NAM summit 
while Dubai Ruler and UAE Vice President/Prime 
Minister Shaykh Maktoum Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum will 
head up the delegation to the proposed March 1 Arab 
League summit.
