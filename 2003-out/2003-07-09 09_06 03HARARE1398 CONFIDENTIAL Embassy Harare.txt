Non-Demonstration 
----------------- 
 
¶3. (C) On July 8 about 15 to 20 MDC members attempted to 
march from Africa Unity Square in downtown Harare to the US 
Embassy to deliver a petition criticizing South African 
President Thabo Mbeki for lack of progress in resolving the 
Zimbabwe crisis, and calling on the USG to pressure the GOZ 
to agree to dialogue with the MDC.  Riot police broke up the 
march before it started by beating and arresting several 
would-be marchers.  According to march organizer Dennis 
Murerwa, special assistant to MDC National Chairman Isaac 
Matongo, the march was an MDC-organized mass action event 
primarily done for publicity, rather than to deliver the 
petition to the US Embassy.  Murerwa said the MDC leadership 
sanctioned plans for ongoing mass actions, however may not 
have been aware of specific plans for this march.  The 
Embassy was not contacted, and has not yet received the 
petition, but Murerwa promised to deliver it to Poloff on 
July 9. 
 
¶4. (SBU) A Daily News article on July 9 reported that about 
3000 demonstrators marched through the streets of downtown 
Harare carrying placards criticizing Mbeki and attempted to 
gather at Africa Unity Square.  RSO and RSOfsn spoke with a 
street vendor in Africa Unity Square on July 8 who reported 
that only about 15 - 20 demonstrators were involved.  A 
different source also reported to the Ambassador that the 
number gathered was more like 15 - 20. 
 
Harare Mayor Released 
--------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) On July 8, Harare Executive Mayor Elias Mudzuri was 
re-arrested, held in a Harare Central Police Station cell for 
seven hours and released without charge.  According to a 
report in the Daily News, and Mudzuri's lawyer Beatrice 
Mtetwa, Mudzuri intends to go to his office on July 9 for the 
third consecutive day to face arrest.  Minister of Local 
Government, Ignatius Chombo suspended the mayor in April 2003 
for alleged misconduct.  Mudzuri, the MDC, and the Combined 
Harare Residents Association claimed the suspension was 
illegal, and the matter is pending in court (Refs A and B). 
 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
¶6. (C) The blatant discrepancy between the number of 
demonstrators who actually showed up, and the number reported 
in the Daily News does nothing for the credibility of that 
paper in reporting on charged political events.  End Comment.
