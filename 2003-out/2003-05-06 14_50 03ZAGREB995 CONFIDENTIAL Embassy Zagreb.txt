SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) IN DECEMBER 2002, THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT PASSED A 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00995  01 OF 03  061502Z 
NEW "CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES."  THAT LAW 
WAS WIDELY HAILED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS A 
REASONABLE COMPROMISE AND A STEP FORWARD FOR MINORITY RIGHTS 
IN CROATIA.  BUT THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SLOW TO 
IMPLEMENT IT, AND CAME UNDER FIRE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY FOR ITS DELAY.  THE LAW CALLS FOR BROAD PROTECTIONS 
OF MINORITY RIGHTS, INCREASED LEVELS OF REPRESENTATION AND 
THE CREATION OF NEW LOCAL- AND NATIONAL- LEVEL "MINORITY 
COUNCILS."  THESE NEW COUNCILS WILL BE STATE-FUNDED AND, 
WHILE THEY HAVE LITTLE DIRECT POLICY RESPONSIBILITIES, ARE 
EXPECTED TO BE INFLUENTIAL IN DIRECTING STATE RESOURCES AND 
IN SELECTING MINORITY CANDIDATES FOR LOCAL BY-ELECTIONS. 
 
¶2.  (C) ON APRIL 10, THE RACAN CABINET LURCHED INTO ACTION 
AND ANNOUNCED THAT ELECTIONS FOR LOCAL MINORITY COUNCILS 
WOULD TAKE PLACE ON MAY 18.  MINORITY GROUPS COMPLAIN THAT 
THE WARNING TIME IS TOO SHORT AND THAT BUREAUCRATIC SNAFUS 
ARE PREVENTING REGISTRATION OF CANDIDATES.  THE LEADER OF THE 
CROATIA'S ETHNIC ITALIAN MINORITY HAS CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT. 
THE OSCE MISSION IN CROATIA -- PERHAPS REFLEXIVELY -- HAS 
JOINED WITH THE MINORITIES IN OBJECTING TO THE SHORT NOTICE, 
BUT HAS ALSO CALLED ON ALL MINORITY GROUPS TO TAKE PART IN 
THE ELECTION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
NEW "CONSTITUTIONAL LAW" ON MINORITIES ... 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (C) CROATIA'S NEW "CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL 
MINORITIES" (CLNM) WAS PASSED ON DECEMBER 13 (REFTEL) AFTER A 
DIVISIVE DEBATE FINALLY PRODUCED A COMPROMISE WITH WHICH 
MINORITY GROUPS, THE OPPOSITION AND THE INTERNATIONAL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00995  01 OF 03  061502Z 
COMMUNITY DECLARED THEY COULD ALL LIVE.  WHILE MINORITY 
GROUPS DID NOT GET EVERYTHING THEY WANTED, GUARANTEED 
MINORITY REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT WAS INCREASED, AND THE 
LAW IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS A STEP FORWARD FOR MINORITY 
RIGHTS. 
 
ESTABLISHES "MINORITY COUNCILS" 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) THE CLNM CALLS FOR THE ELECTION OF NEW MINORITY 
COUNCILS AT THE COMMUNITY, CITY AND COUNTY LEVEL.  IN UNITS 
OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT (CITIES AND TOWNS), EACH ETHNIC 
MINORITY COMMUNITY WHICH HAS MORE THAN 200 INDIVIDUALS AND 
MAKES UP AT LEAST 1.5 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION MAY 
ELECT A MINORITY COUNCIL.  (A SINGLE TOWN WITH MORE THAN ONE 
SIGNIFICANT MINORITY COMMUNITY COULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE 
MINORITY COUNCIL.)  IN ADDITION TO THE LOCAL MINORITY 
COUNCILS, THE CLNM CREATED A NATIONAL-LEVEL COUNCIL MADE UP 
OF FIVE MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNMENT, SEVEN ELECTED BY 
THE LOCAL-LEVEL COUNCILS PLUS ALL OF THE DESIGNATED MINORITY 
REPRESENTATIVES IN PARLIAMENT. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) IN MOST OF THEIR FUNCTIONS, MUNICIPAL MINORITY 
COUNCILS ARE EXPECTED TO ACT AS LOCAL-LEVEL WATCHDOGS FOR THE 
RIGHTS OF THE COMMUNITY THEY REPRESENT.  COUNCILS ARE 
EMPOWERED TO PROPOSE LOCAL LEGISLATION WITH THE AIM OF 
ADVANCING THE GOALS OF THE MINORITY THEY REPRESENT.  THEY MAY 
ALSO REVIEW DECISIONS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODY AND, IF 
THEY BELIEVE A DECISION UNFAIRLY DISADVANTAGES MINORITIES, 
THEY MAY APPEAL IT DIRECTLY TO THE APPROPRIATE MINISTRY IN 
ZAGREB, WHICH MUST IN TURN ANNUL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00995  01 OF 03  061502Z 
DECISION WITHIN EIGHT DAYS IF IT AGREES WITH THE LOCAL 
COUNCIL.  WHILE THE LAW DOES NOT IMPOSE QUOTAS FOR MINORITY 
REPRESENTATION IN CITY OFFICES, COUNCILS HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
"PROPOSE CANDIDATES FOR DUTIES IN STATE ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES 
AND BODIES OF SELF-GOVERNMENT UNITS." 
 
¶6.  (SBU) THE CLNM INSTRUCTS MUNICIPALITIES TO ALLOCATE FUNDS 
TO COVER THE ACTIVITIES OF LOCAL COUNCILS.  COUNCILS HAVE THE 
SAME STATUS AS NGOS AND ARE EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY THE NEW 
LAW TO USE FUNDS FROM PRIVATE DONATIONS, EVEN IF THEY ARE 
FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. 
 
ELECTIONS FOR MINORITY COUNCILS ON MAY 18 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) COUNCILS WILL BE ELECTED BY THE SAME RULES WHICH 
APPLY FOR ELECTIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES.  ACCORDING TO 
THESE RULES, THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF ELECTIONS MUST TAKE PLACE 
NOT LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS BUT NOT MORE THAN SIXTY DAYS BEFORE 
THE ELECTION.  PM RACAN'S CABINET SET THE MAY 18 DATE FOR 
ELECTIONS TO THE MINORITY COUNCILS AT ITS CLOSED SESSION ON 
APRIL 10.  THE DECISION BECAME FINAL ON APRIL 16, THE DATE OF 
ITS PUBLICATION IN CROATIA'S OFFICIAL GAZETTE.

¶8.  (C) MINORITY LEADERS OBJECT TO THE SHORT NOTICE OF THE 
ELECTIONS, BUT MOST HAVE BEGUN PREPARATIONS TO ENSURE THEIR 
ORGANIZATIONS ARE REPRESENTED.  SERB LEADER MILORAD PUPOVAC 
COMPLAINED THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS PUBLISHED RIGHT BEFORE 
THE EASTER SEASON, WHICH MEANT THAT MANY OF THE BUREAUCRATS 
WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUING ELECTION MATERIALS WERE INSTEAD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00995  02 OF 03  061502Z 
STRETCHING LONG WEEKENDS INTO HOLIDAYS.  FULLY 237 
MUNICIPALITIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH MINORITY POPULATION 
TO ELECT MINORITY COUNCILS, EACH OF WHICH CAN HAVE FROM 10 - 
15 MEMBERS (DEPENDING WHETHER IT IS A CITY/TOWN COUNCIL OR A 
COUNTY COUNCIL), PUPOVAC EXPLAINED, AND IT IS A MONUMENTAL 
TASK TO IDENTIFY CANDIDATES, PROVIDE THEM WITH REGISTRATION 
FORMS, ENSURE THEY HAVE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER NOMINATION 
SIGNATURES AND THEN PAY THE FEE (ABOUT USD 7.00). 
 
¶9.  (C) PUPOVAC ADMITTED HE WAS CONCERNED THAT NATIONAL-LEVEL 
ETHNIC POLITICAL PARTIES, LIKE HIS INDEPENDENT SERBIAN 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDSS), WOULD LOSE INFLUENCE IF THEY COULD 
NOT REACH OUT TO ENOUGH LOCAL-LEVEL CANDIDATES IN TIME TO 
SEAT A RESPECTABLE NUMBER OF LOCAL COUNCILORS.  PUPOVAC 
SPECULATED THAT WHILE THE COUNCILS HAVE NO FORMAL ROLE IN 
SELECTING CANDIDATES FOR LOCAL-LEVEL BY-ELECTIONS (REQUIRED 
TO ENSURE PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION BY MINORITIES IN LOCAL 
COUNCILS), HE WAS SURE THAT THE COUNCILS WOULD BE INFLUENTIAL 
IN THAT PROCESS. 
 
¶10.  (C) ETHNIC HUNGARIAN LEADER TIBOR SANTO, WHO HOLDS ONE 
OF FIVE SEATS IN PARLIAMENT DESIGNATED FOR CROATIA'S ETHNIC 
MINORITIES, AGREED THAT THE DEADLINE IS SHORT, BUT SAID THAT 
HE EXPECTED ETHNIC HUNGARIANS TO FIELD LISTS OF CANDIDATES IN 
ALL OF THE TWO DOZEN MUNICIPALITIES WHERE HUNGARIANS MAKE UP 
ENOUGH OF THE POPULATION TO QUALIFY TO FORM MINORITY 
COUNCILS.  HE SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT ACTED 
INAPPROPRIATELY IN SETTING THE MAY 18 ELECTION DATE. 
 
CALL FOR ITALIANS TO BOYCOTT COUNCIL ELECTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00995  02 OF 03  061502Z 
 
¶11.  (C) FURIO RADIN, THE MP REPRESENTING CROATIA'S ITALIAN 
MINORITY IN PARLIAMENT, INSISTS THAT THE MAY 18 DEADLINE IS 
FAR TOO SHORT AND HAS CALLED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO SET 
ANOTHER DATE FAR IN THE FUTURE.  HE PUBLICLY CALLED ON ETHNIC 
ITALIANS TO BOYCOTT THE ELECTION AND SAID THAT CROATIA'S 
ITALIAN UNION (AN ISTRIA-BASED ETHNIC POLITICAL GROUPING) 
WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN DRAFTING LISTS OF CANDIDATES.  RADIN 
TOLD OSCE PRIVATELY THAT THE DEADLINES ARE "IMPOSSIBLE TO 
MEET" AND SPECULATED THAT THE MAY 18 DATE WAS "EITHER A 
RESULT OF UTTER INCOMPETENCE OR A CLEAR WISH ON THE PART OF 
THE GOVERNMENT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT MINORITIES WERE WEAK AND 
INCAPABLE."  RADIN POINTED OUT TO THE OSCE THAT THE ELECTION 
RULES STATE THAT CANDIDATE LISTS MUST BE COMPLETED AND 
SUBMITTED WITHIN TWELVE DAYS OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF 
ELECTIONS.  BECAUSE OF THE EASTER HOLIDAY, THIS PERIOD WAS 
SHORTENED FURTHER. 
 
IS RADIN JUST PROTECTING HIS INTERESTS? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶12.  (C) OTHER ETHNIC LEADERS WERE SURPRISED BY RADIN'S 
VEHEMENCE AND, WHILE THEY RESPECT THE STRONG STANCE TAKEN BY 
THE ITALIANS, THEY WONDER IF THE BOYCOTT TACTIC IS 
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.  SERB LEADER PUPOVAC SPECULATED TO US THAT 
ONE REASON THE ITALIANS MAY OBJECT TO THE NEW MINORITY ORDER 
IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN A PEG.  BEFORE PASSAGE 
OF THE NEW CLNM, BOSNIAKS WERE NOT IDENTIFIED AS AN ETHNIC 
MINORITY.   NOW (USING DATA FROM THE MOST RECENT CENSUS), 
BOSNIAKS ARE THE SECOND MOST NUMEROUS "NATIONAL MINORITY" IN 
CROATIA, WHICH MEANS THAT THEY WILL GET A LARGER SLICE OF 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00995  02 OF 03  061502Z 
STATE FUNDING THAN THE ITALIANS WILL. 
 
¶13.  (C) HUNGARIAN MP SANTO TOLD US THAT RADIN IS MOST LIKELY 
CONCERNED THAT THE NEW MINORITY COUNCILS WILL DISPLACE THE 
ITALIAN UNION.  AS A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION, ONLY UNION 
MEMBERS ELECT THEIR OFFICERS.  CROATIA'S ITALIAN UNION IS 
EXPRESSLY NAMED IN BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT 
OF ITALY AS THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR ETHNIC ITALIANS IN 
CROATIA.  SANTO SPECULATED THAT IF ELECTIONS FOR THE NEW 
COUNCILS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE ITALIAN UNION'S STATUS WILL 
DECREASE.  HE SAID THAT THE MINORITY COUNCILS WERE NOT 
INTENDED TO BE AN EXTENSION OF NATIONAL-LEVEL ETHNIC 
POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THEY WERE INTENDED RATHER TO 
EMPOWER A GROUP OF LOCAL MINORITIES TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND 
MINORITY ISSUES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. 
 
¶14.  (C) MATO ARLOVIC, CHAIR OF THE PARLIAMENT'S 
CONSTITUTION, RULES AND POLITICAL SYSTEM COMMITTEE (WHICH 
DRAFTED THE CLNM) TOLD US THAT RADIN'S RESISTANCE IS ALL 
ABOUT MONEY.  ACCORDING TO ONE PRESS ARTICLE, THE ITALIAN 
GOVERNMENT IS FUNDING THE ITALIAN UNION TO THE TUNE OF ALMOST 
3.5 MILLION EURO IN 2003.  A MINORITY COUNCIL WHICH 
REPRESENTES THE BROADER ETHNIC ITALIAN COMMUNITY IN CROATIA 
MIGHT AT SOME POINT COMPETE FOR THIS FUNDING.

OSCE PRESSES FOR GOC FLEXIBILITY 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶15.  (C) PETER SEMNEBY, HEAD OF THE OSCE MISSION TO CROATIA, 
MET WITH FIRST DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ANTE SIMONIC ON APRIL 25 
TO LOBBY FOR MORE GOC HELP TO MINORITIES SEEKING TO REGISTER 
AS CANDIDATES.  PUBLICLY, THE OSCE IS ENCOURAGING MINORITIES 
TO TAKE PART IN THE ELECTION, BUT PRIVATELY, THEY WONDER 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00995  03 OF 03  061503Z 
WHETHER RADIN IS RIGHT AND WHETHER THE GOC HAS ENGINEERED 
THIS PROCESS TO FAIL.  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER GORAN GRANIC HAS 
BEEN TASKED BY THE CABINET WITH IMPLEMENTING THE CLNM -- 
GRANIC HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY OBSTRUCTIONIST TO INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY EFFORTS ON REFUGEE RETURNS AND WAR CRIMES. 
 
¶16.  (C) PUPOVAC ADMITS THAT THE ACRIMONIOUS DEBATE BEFORE 
PASSAGE OF THE CLNM MAY HAVE MADE SOME LEADING COALITION 
FIGURES -- INCLUDING DPM GRANIC -- LESS EAGER TO REACH OUT TO 
POLITICAL LEADERS OF THE MINORITY COMMUNITY.  PUPOVAC SAID HE 
MET WITH GRANIC JUST AFTER THE APRIL 10 CABINET MEETING WHEN 
THE DATE FOR COUNCIL ELECTIONS HAD BEEN SET (BUT BEFORE 
PUBLICATION), BUT THE DPM MADE NO MENTION OF THE MAY 18 DATE. 
 OSCE DEPUTY HEAD OF MISSION TODD BECKER (PLEASE PROTECT) 
ADMITTED THAT THE GOC ACTIONS HAVE BEEN LEGAL, BUT ADDED THAT 
HE THINKS THIS "OMISSION" COMBINED WITH THE DECISION TO 
SCHEDULE ELECTIONS AT THIRTY-TWO DAYS AFTER ANNOUNCING 
ELECTIONS (RATHER THAN CLOSER TO 60 DAYS) SHOWS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WANT THESE ELECTIONS TO BE A SUCCESS. 
 
GOC EXTENDS DEADLINE TO VERIFY VOTER ROLLS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶17.  (C) THERE ARE SOME RECENT SIGNS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS 
RESPONDING TO PRESSURE TO MAKE THE ELECTIONS A SUCCESS.  MANY 
MUNICIPALITIES HAVE ALREADY PUBLISHED CANDIDATE LISTS.  ON 
MAY 5, THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED AN EXTENSION OF THE DEADLINE 
FOR MINORITIES TO CHECK VOTER REGISTRATION LISTS TO ENSURE 
ALL ELIGIBLE RESIDENTS WILL BE ALLOWED TO CAST BALLOTS. 
PUPOVAC WELCOMED THE EXTENSION OF THE DEADLINE, BUT IT WAS 
NOT ENOUGH FOR RADIN; HE TOLD US ON MAY 6 THAT THE ITALIANS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00995  03 OF 03  061503Z 
STILL PLAN TO BOYCOTT THE ELECTION AND PLANS TO SEEK A NEW 
DATE FOR ITALIAN ELECTIONS.  (WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOYCOTT 
IS NOT TOTAL; SOME ETHNIC ITALIAN COMMUNITIES HAVE PROPOSED 
CANDIDATE LISTS OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF THE ITALIAN UNION.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶18. (C) THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS BEEN PUSHING THE GOC 
TO MOVE FORWARD ON IMPLEMENTING THE CLNM SINCE IT WAS PASSED, 
AND THE MINORITY COMMUNITIES HERE HAVE CHEERED US ON.  NOW 
THAT THE GOC IS MOVING FORWARD, THE MINORITIES ARE CRYING 
"FOUL" AND ARE ASKING FOR A DELAY IN THIS ELECTION.  THIS 
ELECTION SHOULD NOT HAVE COME AS A SURPRISE TO ANYONE IN THE 
MINORITY COMMUNITY, LEAST OF ALL TO RADIN.  HE HELPED DRAFT 
THE CLNM AND KNOWS THE DEADLINES AND TIME LIMITS IN THE 
ELECTION RULES.  WE THINK THE OSCE'S CURRENT PUBLIC LINE IS 
RIGHT ON THE MONEY: KEEP THE PRESSURE ON THE GOC TO COMMIT 
RESOURCES AND SHOW FLEXIBILITY AS THE ELECTION APPROACHES 
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ENCOURAGING MINORITIES TO PARTICIPATE.
