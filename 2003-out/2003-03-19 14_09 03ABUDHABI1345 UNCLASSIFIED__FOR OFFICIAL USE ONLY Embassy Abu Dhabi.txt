PROGRESS 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Ambassador discussed the status of the 
UAE's Federal Customs Authority (FCA) with Finance 
Minstate Dr. Muhammad Khalfan bin Khirbash (the de 
facto Finance Minister) on March 18.  Dr. Khirbash 
stated that while the legislation creating the Federal 
Customs Authority has been passed -- and the authority 
has even held its first meeting under the leadership 
of the nominal chair, Hamdan bin Rashad Al-Maktoum 
(the nominal Finance Minister) -- no federal customs 
law has been enacted which would lay out with 
precision the powers of the FCA.  It had been agreed 
by the individual emirates that the FCA would be 
responsible for overseeing the collection of fees 
resulting from the GCC Customs Union, and for 
maintaining a UAE-wide list of products to be exempted 
from these duties.  But until legislation is passed 
(most likely by June of this year), the FCA's powers 
are very limited.  Dr. Khirbash said it would take 
several months after the passage of this implementing 
legislation for the FCA to become fully effective. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: The UAE is strongly committed to 
the GCC customs union but, because of its unique 
confederal nature, faces distinctive challenges in 
developing an effective federal structure to oversee 
what is primarily, according to the UAE constitution, 
an Emirate-level responsibility.
