SUBJECT: FONMIN MUASHER WILL NOT ATTEND MARCH 24 CAIRO ARAB 
LEAGUE MINISTERIAL 
 
REF: STATE 75616 
 
Classified By: A/DCM Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  Ambassador spoke with Foreign Minister Marwan 
Muasher March 23 to deliver ref points on the planned March 
24 Arab League ministerial meeting in Cairo.  The Ambassador 
asked that Jordan work to avoid statements or actions that 
would undermine current efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime 
and liberate the Iraqi people, and to help the meeting focus 
on support for a new Iraq. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Muasher responded that he was sure the ministerial 
would be "a bad meeting," especially "with Libya in the 
chair."  Consequently, he did not want to be associated with 
it and would not attend.  He said he did not expect "the Gulf 
Foreign Ministers" to attend.  Muasher said Jordan's 
Ambassador in Cairo will represent Jordan, and that he has 
instructions to avoid language that will undermine coalition 
efforts, and to encourage discussion of the future of Iraq.
