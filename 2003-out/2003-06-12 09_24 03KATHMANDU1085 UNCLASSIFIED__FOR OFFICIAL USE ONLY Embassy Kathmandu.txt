THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE TREAT 
ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  ON JUNE 11, AFTER CONSULTATIONS WITH 
THE MAIN POLITICAL PARTY LEADERS, PRIME MINISTER THAPA 
APPOINTED SIX MINISTERS FROM HIS OWN CENTER-RIGHT PARTY, 
THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (RPP).  WITH ONE EXCEPTION, 
ALL THE NEW APPOINTEES HAVE PREVIOUS MINISTERIAL 
EXPERIENCE WITH HALF OF THOSE SERVING DURING THE PARTY- 
LESS PANCHAYAT ERA.  BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION FOLLOWS. 
THE APPOINTMENTS REFLECT SOME ETHNIC AND GENDER DIVERSITY. 
MANY PORTFOLIOS REMAIN IN THE CABINET FOR OTHER POLITICAL 
PARTIES, BUT MANY ARE LIKELY TO COMPLAIN THAT THAPA HAS 
APPOINTED A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF MINISTERS FROM HIS 
OWN PARTY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) AFTER A WEEK OF EARNEST CONSULTATIONS WITH THE 
MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES, PRIME MINISTER SURYA BAHADUR THAPA 
ON JUNE 11, APPOINTED FIVE MEN AND ONE WOMAN FROM HIS OWN 
CENTER-RIGHT PARTY, THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (RPP), 
TO SIX MINISTERIAL POSITIONS.  BIOGRAPHICAL DATA FOLLOWS. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
DR. PRAKASH CHANDRA LOHANI: MINISTER OF 
FINANCE 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) DR. PRAKASH CHANDRA LOHANI (B. 1944), A U.S.- 
TRAINED ECONOMIST AND FULBRIGHT SCHOLAR WITH DEGREES FROM 
INDIANA UNIVERSITY (MBA) AND UCLA (PH.D.), IS A SENIOR 
LEADER OF THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (RPP).  LOHANI HAS 
HELD A VARIETY OF GOVERNMENT POSITIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN 
MINISTER UNDER SHER BAHADUR DEUBA (1996-1997) AND UNDER 
LOKENDRA BAHADUR CHAND (EARLY 1997) AND MINISTER OF 
AGRICULTURE UNDER SURYA BAHADUR THAPA (1998).  HE HAS BEEN 
ELECTED TWICE TO PARLIAMENT FROM THE NUWAKOT DISTRICT OF 
CENTRAL NEPAL.  OF THE BRAHMIN CASTE, LOHANI IS MARRIED

MORE POWERFUL MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY

AN OPPORTUNIST IN 1996 WHEN HE REPEATEDLY CHANGED SIDES 
DURING PARLIAMENTARY MANEUVERING TO BRING DOWN THE SHER 
BAHADUR DEUBA GOVERNMENT.  HIS ELEVATION TO THE RANK OF 
FOREIGN MINISTER IN JUNE 1997 PROBABLY REFLECTED MORE THEN- 
PRIME MINISTER CHAND'S INTEREST IN LOCKING THAPA INTO THE 
GOVERNMENT THAN ANY HIGH ESTEEM FOR HIS ABILITIES.  THAPA 
REMAINED IN THE POST UNTIL APRIL 1998, WHEN THE CHAND 
GOVERNMENT FELL. HE WAS APPOINTED AS THE GENERAL SECRETARY 
OF THE RPP IN MAY 2003.  THAPA WAS ALSO ACTIVE DURING THE

COMMENT 
--------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) PRIME MINISTER THAPA'S SIX MINISTERIAL 
APPOINTMENTS REVEAL SOME ETHNIC AND GENDER DIVERSITY WITH 
ONE WOMAN (THE 40-MEMBER CABINET THAT WAS DISSOLVED IN 
OCTOBER 2002 WAS TOTALLY MALE), A TAMANG (AN ETHNIC 
MINORITY) AND A YADAV (LOW CASTE).  THAPA REPORTEDLY HAS 
SAID THAT THE APPOINTMENTS REMAIN FLEXIBLE IN ORDER TO 
ACCOMMODATE OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES IF THEY AGREE TO JOIN 
THE GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, CONFLICTING RUMORS ABOUND IN 
KATHMANDU POLITICAL CIRCLES ABOUT WHETHER THE LARGEST TWO 
POLITICAL PARTIES WILL JOIN THAPA'S GOVERNMENT.  ALTHOUGH 
ROOM REMAINS FOR OTHER PARTIES TO JOIN THE CABINET, SOME 
WILL LIKELY COMPLAIN THAT THAPA APPOINTED A 
DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF MINISTERS FROM HIS OWN PARTY, 
WHICH HELD ONLY 11 OF 205 SEATS IN THE OLD PARLIAMENT. 
END COMMENT.
