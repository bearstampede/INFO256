SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION PRESIDENT BUSH'S VISIT TO AFRICA; 
HARARE 
 
 
  ¶1.   An editorial and an op-ed article carried in the July 
      13 edition of the pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" 
      concentrate on the talks between President George W. Bush 
      and his South African counterpart, Thabo Mbeki, during 
      President Bush's visit to Africa.  Excerpts follow: 
 
  ¶2.   Under headline "Time to set road map in motion" the 
      paper comments: 
 
      "U. S. President George W. Bush left Africa last 
      week after making significantly progressive 
      statements on the resolution of Zimbabwe's political 
      stalemate.  His endorsement of the African 
      initiative on Zimbabwe was the final confirmation to 
      all those who expected and actually agitated for a 
      more muscular approach to the country's protracted 
      impasse that only Africans and Zimbabweans in 
      particular were better placed to sort out the 
      country's challenges. . .The country must now put 
      into motion its road map for a transition out of the 
      current impasse without getting obfuscated by 
      academic and irrelevant demands that do not serve 
      the interests of the nations. . . ." 
 
  ¶3.   Under headline "Zimbabwe: The messages from the 
      Mbeki/Bush meeting" the same newspaper carried the 
      following op-ed under its ghost column "The 
      Scrutator" on page 10: 
 
      ". . .But, was there a `climb-down' on the part of 
      the U. S. A., as claimed in some official circles 
      here in Zimbabwe?  No.  There could have been no 
      `climb-down' if there had been no `climb-up' in the 
      first instance.  For, the position of both the 
      ¶U. S. A. and Britain on the question of Zimbabwe had 
      been stated quite clearly by the American Assistant 
      Secretary of State, William Kansteiner. . .following 
      the visit to Harare on 5 May, 2003, by the three 
      African Presidents, Mbeki, Obasanjo and Muluzi. 
      Both expressed confidence in this "African 
      initiative. . .'  So, if there had been a 
      `climb-down,' it was in May, 2003, after which the 
      burden was firmly on Mbeki's shoulders.  That Bush 
      would so unequivocally re-affirm that. . .is only a 
      pyrric (sic) victory for those in Zimbabwe who are 
      gloating over what they perceive as another defeat 
      for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change (MDC); 
      in reality, it is a major challenge for Mbeki in 
      particular and a loud warning for Harare. . . ."
