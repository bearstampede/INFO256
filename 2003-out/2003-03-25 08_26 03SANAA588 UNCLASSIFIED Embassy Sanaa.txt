SUBJECT: ROYG APPROACHED TO FREEZE IRAQI ASSETS 
 
REF: A. STATE 75235 
     Â¶B. STATE 74249 
 
During 3/24 meeting with Abdul-Salam Al-Awadi, Chief of MFA's 
Americas Office, DCM solicited ROYG cooperation in 
identifying, freezing, and ultimately transferring Iraqi 
government funds for the benefit of the people of Iraq (ref 
B).  Awadi took note of the request and indicated he would 
refer it to decision-making levels of the ROYG.  He asked for 
clarification on whether this action would affect Iraqi 
government accounts, Iraqi civilian accounts, or both.  DCM 
reiterated that our request pertained solely to Iraqi 
government accounts.  Awadi had no information on the 
accuracy of reftel's cited figure for Iraqi assets in Yemen 
($23.45 million) per 6/91 declaration to the UN.
