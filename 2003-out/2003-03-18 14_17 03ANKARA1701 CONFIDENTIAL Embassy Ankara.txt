(C) On March 18 polmiloff met with MFA Iraq Desk officer 
Ferhat Alkan and delivered Ref A points.  Alkan readily 
agreed that a UNGA emergency special session on Iraq would 
serve only to intensify and highlight the divisions within 
the UN.  He thought that it had the potential to damage the 
institution further.  Though he was unable to answer what 
Turkey's position would be, he committed to passing our 
request up his chain of command expeditiously.
