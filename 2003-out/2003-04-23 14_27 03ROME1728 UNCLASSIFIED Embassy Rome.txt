SUBJECT:  FAO/WHO RELEASE OF EXPERT REPORT ON DIET, 
NUTRITION AND PREVENTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY. THE DIRECTORS GENERAL OF THE WORLD HEALTH 
ORGANIZATION (WHO) AND THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 
ORGANIZATION (FAO) PRESIDED OVER THE 4/23 RELEASE OF THE 
WHO/FAO EXPERT CONSULTATION REPORT ON DIET, NUTRITION AND 
PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. BOTH DIRECTORS 
GENERAL EMPHASIZED THAT THE REPORT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING 
OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GLOBAL STRATEGY AND EXPRESSED 
CONFIDENCE IN THE REPORT'S SOUND SCIENTIFIC BASIS. FAO 
DIRECTOR GENERAL DIOUF STATED THAT THE FAO GOVERNING 
BODIES WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE REPORT AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE.  CONCERNING THE CONTROVERSIAL SUGAR 
RECOMMENDATION, DIOUF SAID THAT THE ISSUE "HAD BEEN TAKEN 
OUT OF CONTEXT" AND NOTED THAT THE RECOMMENDATION WAS NOT 
A "STANDARD TO BE REGULATED."  IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION 
FROM THE PRESS, WHO DIRECTOR GENERAL BRUNTLAND SAID THAT 
SHE HADN'T SEEN SUCH A "STRONG AND MISDIRECTED" RESPONSE 
(FROM THE SUGAR INDUSTRY) SINCE THE "TOBACCO INDUSTRY WAS 
ON THE MOVE."  AMBASSADOR TONY HALL'S PRESS RELEASE, 
ISSUED THE SAME DAY, EXPRESSED U.S. COMMITMENT TO 
ADDRESSING THE GLOBAL NEED FOR IMPROVED DIETS AND 
INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO FIGHT PREVENTABLE CHRONIC 
DISEASES, BUT STATED THAT THE WHO/FAO REPORT FELL SHORT 
OF PRESENTING THE COMPREHENSIVE BODY OF EVIDENCE AND 
RIGOROUS CONCLUSIONS NECESSARY TO SERVE AS A BASIS FOR 
WHO AND FAO POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  THE DIRECTORS GENERAL OF WHO AND FAO PRESIDED OVER 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01728  01 OF 03  231431Z 
THE 4/23 RELEASE OF THE WHO/FAO EXPERT REPORT ON DIET, 
NUTRITION AND PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AT FAO 
HEADQUARTERS IN ROME.  MS. SHIRIKI KUMANYIKA, VICE-CHAIR 
OF THE EXPERT CONSULTATION, PROVIDED A SHORT OVERVIEW OF 
THE REPORT.  SPEAKING TO AN AUDIENCE OF FAO STAFFERS, 
PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES AND THE MEDIA, WHO DIRECTOR 
GENERAL (DG) BRUNTLAND STATED THAT CHRONIC DISEASES 
CAUSED 40 MILLION PREMATURE DEATHS PER YEAR AND THAT 
DISEASES SUCH AS OBESITY AND DIABETES WERE NO LONGER A 
"RICH COUNTRY PROBLEM."  THE EXPERT REPORT ON DIET, 
NUTRITION AND PREVENTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES CONTAINED 
THE "BEST CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE" AND WILL SERVE AS 
THE "SCIENCE-BASED FOUNDATION" FOR THE GLOBAL STRATEGY 
STILL TO BE DEVELOPED.  SHE NOTED THAT MANY OF THE 
CONCLUSIONS -- THAT A HEALTHY DIET WAS ONE LOW IN SUGAR, 
SALT AND SATURATED FATS, AND HIGH IN FRUITS AND 
VEGETABLES -- WERE NOT NEW BUT HAD BEEN SUBSTANTIATED BY 
MORE RECENT RESEARCH.  BRUNTLAND DETAILED NEXT STEPS FOR 
THE FORMULATION OF THE GLOBAL STRATEGY, INCLUDING MEETING 
WITH STAKEHOLDERS (INDUSTRY, NGO'S) IN PREPARATION FOR A 
STRATEGY TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE WHO EXECUTIVE BOARD IN 
¶2004. 
 
¶3.  CONCERNING MEMBER REACTIONS TO THE REPORT, SHE 
REPORTED THAT A RECENT EUROPEAN REGION MEETING HAD 
CONCLUDED THAT ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY TOOLS SHOULD BE 
USED (TO IMPLEMENT THE STRATEGY) AND HAD NOTED THE 
IMPLICATIONS FOR ADVERTISING, MARKETING, TRADE AND FISCAL 
POLICIES.  THE EUROPEAN MEETING HAD ALSO CONCLUDED 
(ACCORDING TO BRUNTLAND), THAT TRADE AGREEMENTS AND 
DECISIONS ON AGRICULTURE SHOULD BE ASSESSED IN TERMS OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01728  01 OF 03  231431Z 
THEIR IMPACT ON HEALTH.  BRUNTLAND CONCLUDED THAT SHIFTS 
IN DIET AND EXERCISE COULD LEAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON 
HEALTH AND THAT THE EXPERT REPORT CONSTITUTED A "MAJOR 
CONTRIBUTION TO THIS EFFORT." 
 
¶4.  FAO DG JACQUES DIOUF CALLED THE REPORT "TIMELY" AND 
"SIGNIFICANT" AND A MANIFESTATION OF THE LONG 
COLLABORATION BETWEEN FAO AND WHO IN THE "GENERATION OF 
SCIENCE-BASED ADVICE."  HE DISCUSSED THE PROCESS OF 
CONVENING THE SCIENTISTS AND SPECIALISTS TO PREPARE THE 
EXPERT REPORT, EMPHASIZING THEIR "INDEPENDENCE" AND 
"SCIENTIFIC EXCELLENCE."  HE ALSO STATED THAT THE PROCESS 
WAS TRANSPARENT AND INVOLVED STAKEHOLDERS. IN THIS 
CONTEXT HE SAID THAT SOME RECOMMENDATIONS, SUCH AS THE 
SUGAR RECOMMENDATION, HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT.  IT 
WAS NOT MEANT TO BE A "PRECISE SCIENTIFIC" AMOUNT, BUT 
THE "BEST COMPROMISE BASED ON CURRENT KNOWLEDGE WHICH WAS 
DESIRABLE FOR A POPULATION AT LARGE", AND WAS NOT A 
"STANDARD TO BE REGULATED."  HE NOTED THAT MORE RESEARCH 
NEEDED TO BE DONE, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
WHERE ACCESS TO ALTERNATIVE FOODS MAY BE LIMITED. 
 
¶5.  DIOUF EMPHASIZED THAT THE REPORT WAS "THE BEGINNING," 
NOT THE END OF THE PROCESS. THE REPORT AND THE FAO 
RESPONSE WILL BE PRESENTED TO FAO'S GOVERNING BODIES AS

SUBJECT:  FAO/WHO RELEASE OF EXPERT REPORT ON DIET, 
NUTRITION AND PREVENTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES 
 
SOON AS POSSIBLE.  FAO'S RESPONSE WILL INCLUDE AN 
ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT ON CONSUMERS AND FARMERS IN 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  IT WILL LOOK AT HOW FOOD AND 
AGRICULTURAL SECTORS WILL ADJUST AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR 
PRODUCTS, PROCESSING AND TRADE.  HE NOTED THAT THE 
RECOMMENDATION ON FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND FISH HAD 
IMPLICATIONS FOR FAO'S WORK ON HORTICULTURE AND 
FISHERIES, AND "PRESENTED OPPORTUNITIES" FOR DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES WHICH MAY HAVE A "COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE" IN 
PRODUCING THESE FOODS. 
 
MEDIA QUESTIONS: 
 
¶6.  THE REUTERS CORRESPONDENT ASKED FOR COMMENT ON THE 
SUGAR INDUSTRY ALLEGATION THAT THE REPORT WOULD CAUSE 
PEOPLE TO THINK "THERE IS A HEALTH RISK TO CONSUMING MORE 
THAN 10 PERCENT SUGAR" AND THEIR REQUEST TO HAVE THE 
REPORT "REMOVED FROM THE WHO WEBSITE."  MS. SHIRIKI 
KUMANYIKA, VICE-CHAIR OF THE EXPERT CONSULTATION, CALLED 
THIS REACTION "UNFORTUNATE," NOTING THAT THE SUGAR 
RECOMMENDATION IS A TARGET FOR A POPULATION AT LARGE, AND 
THAT THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT HAD NOT CHANGED SINCE THE 
WHO'S LAST REPORT (1990) ON THE SUBJECT.  SHE SAID THAT 
THE EVIDENCE BETWEEN OBESITY AND DENTAL CARIES AND SUGAR 
WAS "EXTREMELY WELL ESTABLISHED" AND THAT THE EXPERTS HAD 
NOT "MISCONSTRUED THE EVIDENCE."

PAGE 03        ROME  01728  02 OF 03  231431Z 
¶7.  WHO DG BRUNTLAND RESPONDED THAT THE "SOLIDITY OF THE 
WORK IS WELL-FOUNDED WHICH MAKES THOSE "CRITICISMS 
UNREASONABLE."  SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD NOT SEEN SUCH A 
"STRONG AND MISDIRECTED" MISSIVES (FROM THE SUGAR 
INDUSTRY) SINCE THE DAYS WHEN "THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY WAS 
ON THE MOVE." 
 
¶8.  A JAPANESE CORRESPONDENT QUERIED HOW THE "COOPERATION 
OF THE FAST-FOOD INDUSTRIES" WOULD BE OBTAINED.  FAO DG 
DIOUF RESPONDED, "SOME PEOPLE OVERUSE FAST FOOD AND THIS 
HAS LED TO OBESITY, BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE COMPOSITION OF 
THE FOOD AND THE OVERALL FOOD INTAKE.  DG WHO DG 
BRUNTLAND STATED THAT "FAST FOOD ONCE A MONTH, OR A WEEK 
WAS OK, BUT AS A DAILY ROUTINE IT WILL RESULT IN 
NUTRITIONAL STATUS GOING DOWN AND BODY WEIGHT GOING UP." 
SHE ADDED THAT DRINKING "SUGARY DRINKS" MADE THE 
SITUATION "EVEN WORSE." 
 
COMMENTS FROM FAO PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES 
 
¶9.  THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES OF ZIMBABWE, SPEAKING 
FOR THE AFRICAN GROUP, WELCOMED THE PROGRESSIVE DEEPENING 
OF KNOWLEDGE ON THE SUBJECT, BUT EMPHASIZED MEMBER STATE 
INTEREST IN "SHAPING THE AGRICULTURAL COMPONENT, 
PARTICULARLY HOW AND WHEN TO SHIFT PRODUCTION." SHE 
RECALLED THAT MEMBER STATES STILL NEEDED TO DISCUSS THE 
REPORT; THEY HAD A PROBLEM "HAVING THE REPORT ATTRIBUTED 
TO US" BEFORE IT HAD BEEN SEEN BY THE FAO'S POLICY MAKING 
BODIES.  FAO DG DIOUF RESPONDED THAT FAO MEMBERS WOULD BE 
FULLY INVOLVED AND MENTIONED THAT THE REPORT WOULD BE 
PRESENTED TO THE FAO COUNCIL.  HE ALSO NOTED THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01728  02 OF 03  231431Z 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN "FAO EXPERT REPORT" AND AN "FAO 
STRATEGY" (THE LATTER BEING MEMBER-OWNED, THE FORMER 
REPRESENTING THE VIEWS OF THE EXPERTS). 
 
¶10.  THE AMBASSADOR OF BRAZIL ASKED WHETHER THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS WERE TO BECOME "STANDARDS" OR "GOALS." HE 
NOTED IN THIS CONTEXT THAT THE INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF 
THE REPORT (PRESENTED BY VICE-CHAIR KUMANYIKA) HAD 
REFERRED TO THE ROLE OF CODEX ALIMENTARIUS.  HE ASKED FOR 
ASSURANCES THAT "STRATEGIES" ADOPTED BY GOVERNMENTS NOT 
BECOME BARRIERS TO FREE TRADE IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. 
DG DIOUF RESPONDED THAT CODEX WAS AN "INTERGOVERNMENTAL 
BODY," THAT ANY STRATEGY WOULD HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED BY 
MEMBERS IN THE GOVERNING BODIES AND "GO THROUGH THE 
NORMAL PROCESS."  (DIOUF DID NOT DIRECTLY ANSWER THE 
QUESTION ON TRADE BARRIERS.) 
 
U.S. PRESS RELEASE

RECOMMENDATIONS" AND WELCOMING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FAO

¶12.  BEGIN TEXT OF PRESS RELEASE: 
 
THE BEST POSSIBLE SCIENTIFIC AND PUBLIC HEALTH EVIDENCE 
SHOULD BE THE CORNERSTONE OF THE 2004 GLOBAL STRATEGY ON 
DIET, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND HEALTH.  I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, 
THAT THE WHO/FAO REPORT FALLS SHORT OF PRESENTING THE 
COMPREHENSIVE BODY OF EVIDENCE AND RIGOROUS CONCLUSIONS 
NECESSARY TO SERVE AS A BASIS FOR WHO AND FAO POLICY 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
 
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS REPORT HAS NEVER EVEN BEEN AN ITEM 
FOR DISCUSSION AMONG THE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF FAO.  THIS 
IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE 
IMPLICATIONS FOR AGRICULTURE AROUND THE WORLD.  THE 
CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE 
DEVELOPING WORLD SERVE TO REMIND US OF THE IMPORTANCE OF 
GETTING THE SCIENCE RIGHT.  THE CONSEQUENCES OF DIET AND 
NUTRITION ADVICE - AND THIS REPORT - EXTEND WELL BEYOND 
PUBLIC HEALTH TO THE VERY ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF THE 
FARMERS WHO PRODUCE THE FOODS WE EAT.  WE WELCOME THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS IN DEPTH AT THE NEXT FAO 
COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE.

PAGE 03        ROME  01728  03 OF 03  231432Z 
SOUND SCIENCE CAN HELP GOVERNMENTS EFFECTIVELY PROMOTE 
PUBLIC HEALTH.  A TRANSPARENT AND PARTICIPATORY 
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THAT INCORPORATES A RANGE OF 
STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS CAN HELP TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE 
SOLUTIONS AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES. 
 
GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUES SURROUNDING DIET, 
NUTRITION AND THE PREVENTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES, WE 
BELIEVE EXPERT PEERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING 
THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH COMMUNITY, INDUSTRY, NON- 
GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND PROFESSIONAL HEALTH 
SOCIETIES, WOULD STRENGTHEN THE REPORT'S FINDINGS WITH 
ONGOING DEBATE.  SUCH DISCUSSION WOULD ALSO PROVIDE 
VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AS THE WHO, FAO, AND MEMBER 
GOVERNMENTS MOVE FORWARD IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GLOBAL 
STRATEGY ON DIET, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND HEALTH TO BE 
CONSIDERED IN 2004. 
 
THE UNITED STATES IS COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE GLOBAL 
NEED FOR IMPROVED DIETS AND INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 
TO FIGHT PREVENTABLE CHRONIC DISEASES SUCH AS DIABETES, 
HEART DISEASE, AND CERTAIN CANCERS.  OUR PASSION IS 
REFLECTED IN PRESIDENT BUSH'S HEALTHIER U.S. INITIATIVE, 
AND IN OTHER FEDERAL INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE HEALTHIER 
LIFESTYLES.  TOMMY G. THOMPSON, U.S. SECRETARY OF HEALTH 
AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND ANN VENEMAN, U.S. SECRETARY OF 
AGRICULTURE, HAVE MET WITH LEADERS FROM THE FOOD 
INDUSTRY, GROCERY MANUFACTURERS, FRUIT AND VEGETABLE 
GROWERS, THE SOFT DRINK INDUSTRY AND OTHER INDUSTRIES TO 
HELP US COMBAT THE U.S. OBESITY EPIDEMIC.  END TEXT.
