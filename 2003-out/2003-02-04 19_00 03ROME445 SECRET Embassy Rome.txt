SUBJECT: (S) AMBASSADOR ENGAGES PRIME MINISTRY ON SHIPMENT 
OF PATROL BOATS TO IRAN 
 
REF: A. ROME 399 AND PREVIOUS 
 
     ¶B. STATE 29285 
     ¶C. 01/31/03 EDDY-KILNER E-MAIL 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING DCM SCOTT KILNER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (S) AMBASSADOR SEMBLER, TOGETHER WITH ACTING DCM AND 
POLMIN, USED THE OPPORTUNITY OF A FEBRUARY 4 MEETING WITH 
GIOVANNI CASTELLANETA, SENIOR DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR TO PRIME 
MINISTER BERLUSCONI, TO RAISE CONTINUING STRONG U.S. CONCERNS 
ABOUT THE SHIPMENT OF HIGH-SPEED PATROL BOATS FROM ITALY TO 
IRAN, AND TO PRESENT POINTS PROVIDED IN REF B.  ALTHOUGH 
CASTELLANETA SAID HE WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CASE, HE 
QUICKLY GRASPED ITS SERIOUSNESS, GIVEN HIS PRIOR SERVICE AS 
THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR TO IRAN (1992-95).  HE IMMEDIATELY 
RECOGNIZED THE IMAGERY OF THE BANDAR E ABBAS PORT FACILITY 
(REF C), NOTING HE HAD VISITED THE PORT HIMSELF.  "I KNOW 
THAT THE IRANIAN NAVY USES SUCH BOATS," HE ADDED. 
 
¶2. (S) A/DCM UNDERLINED THE HIGH-LEVEL OF USG FRUSTRATION AT 
THE LACK OF GOI ACTION TO IMPEDE SUCH EXPORTS, DESPITE OUR 
NUMEROUS ENTREATIES GOING BACK MANY MONTHS.  PARTICULARLY 
PERPLEXING WAS THAT THE MFA TELLS US IT KNOWS THESE FAST 
BOATS ARE GOING TO THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD (ROME 293), BUT 
STILL REFUSES TO CONSIDER THEM AS DUAL USE.  SECRETARY 
POWELL, WE CONTINUED, HAD FELT COMPELLED TO RAISE OUR 
CONCERNS DURING HIS MEETING IN JANUARY WITH FOREIGN MINISTER 
FRATTINI.  FRATTINI HAD ASKED FOR MORE INFORMATION, WHICH 
WASHINGTON PROVIDED AND THE EMBASSY DELIVERED TO THE MFA LAST 
WEEK (REF A).  THE MATTER WAS NOW PARTICULARLY URGENT, GIVEN 
THE REPORTED ARRIVAL IN NAPLES OF ADDITIONAL PATROL BOATS AND 
RELATED ACCESSORIES FOR IMMINENT DELIVERY TO IRAN.  THE U.S. 
URGED THE GOI TO PREVENT THE ONWARD SHIPMENT OF THESE ITEMS. 
THE U.S. BELIEVES THE GOI HAS THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO TAKE 
ACTION;  WHAT IS REQUIRED IS THE POLITICAL WILL TO DO SO. 
 
¶3. (S)  WE CONCLUDED BY REQUESTING THAT THE PRIME MINISTER'S 
OFFICE GIVE DIRECT ATTENTION TO OUR CONCERNS.  CASTELLANETA 
SAID HE NEEDED NO CONVINCING OF THE DANGER POSED BY THE 
IRANIAN MILITARY AND WOULD LOOK INTO THE MATTER RIGHT AWAY. 
SEMBLER
