PHILIP MADANAT IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF AMMANNET RADIO, 
THE FIRST INTERNET RADIO IN THE ARAB WORLD AND THE ONLY ONE 
IN JORDAN.  AMMANNET WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1999 WITH THE HELP 
OF UNESCO, BUT HAS SINCE GONE INDEPENDENT AND HAS 
COOPERATIVE RELATIONS WITH A NUMBER OF LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS 
IN THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS IN JORDAN.  AMMANNET 
COVERS VARIOUS POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ISSUES BOTH 
LOCALLY AND REGIONALLY.  THE CONCEPT OF INTERNET RADIO 
REMAINS NOVEL IN JORDAN, BUT ITS POTENTIAL IN EXPANDING THE 
LIMITS IMPOSED ON PRESS FREEDOMS IN THE COUNTRY IS GRADUALLY 
BEING NOTICED AND RECOGNIZED.  MADANAT, A BUSINESSMAN 
RUNNING A MEDIA ORGANIZATION, EXPRESSED AN UNDERSTANDING FOR 
THE POSSIBILITY OF STRETCHING THE LIMITS OF FREEDOM OF 
EXPRESSION AND PRESS FREEDOMS IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING ISSUES 
OF GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.  THIS IS 
PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING IN A REGION 
WHERE CRITICISM OF GOVERNMENTS AND REGIMES IS NOT WELL- 
APPRECIATED.  MADANAT IS SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN MAKING 
AMMANNET A CONDUIT FOR RAISING THE CEILING OF ACCOUNTABILITY 
AND TRANSPARENCY, SPECIALLY IN THE FIELDS OF GOVERNMENT AND 
BUSINESS IN JORDAN.  WE BELIEVE THAT BY TAKING PART IN THIS 
PROGRAM, MADANAT WILL BE ABLE TO APPLY THE KNOWLEDGE OF 
INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC GRASS-ROOTS ORGANIZING TECHNIQUES TO 
WIDEN THE SCOPE AND IMPACT OF AMMANNET'S WORK IN JORDAN.
