SUBJECT: (C)  TFIZ01:  UAE AIRSPACE TO STAY OPEN, 
AUSTRALIAN DEPENDANTS ORDERED HOME, WFP TO OPEN 
IRAQ OFFICE IN DUBAI 
 
¶1.  (U)  Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (b, d). 
 
IRAQ WAR WON'T CLOSE UAE AIRSPACE 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Muhammad Al-Ghaith, the head of the UAE's 
federal civil aviation authority, told Econchief 
3/19 that he had just signed a circular ordering 
UAE airspace to remain open in the event of an Iraq 
contingency.  Al-Ghaith said he did not expect air 
traffic in the UAE would be significantly affected 
by a war; perhaps a few carriers would reduce 
flights, but others (including the UAE's own 
Emirates Airline) would likely add service if 
demand warranted. 
 
AUSTRALIA ORDERS OUT DIPLOMATIC DEPENDANTS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (C)  Australian Ambassador Campbell told the 
Ambassador 3/19 that Canberra has decided to pull 
all diplomatic dependants from the UAE.  All 
diplomatic staff would remain, Campbell noted, but 
given the regional the determination had been made 
to send all dependants home.  The Australian envoy 
indicated that not having a similar measure to our 
authorized or voluntary departure, the GOA had been 
forced to choose between no action and the ordered 
departure of dependants. 
 
WFP IRAQ OFFICE IN DUBAI 
------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (C)  MFA A/USEC Abdullah Rashid Al-Nuaimi told 
Polchief 3/19 that a WFP delegation had that 
morning met with the MFA to discuss the possibility 
of opening up an office in Dubai to coordinate 
humanitarian food shipments to Iraq.  Al-Nuaimi 
said he thought the office would be opened "almost 
immediately."  In response to our demarche on 
funding for WFP Iraq activities, the MFA official 
noted that the WFP had not raised this issue and 
that the UAE in any case will likely continue to 
deliver its humanitarian aid, including food, 
through the UAE Red Crescent Authority which still 
has a good presence on the ground in Iraq and 
enjoys good working relationships with the Iraqi 
Red Crescent.  Polchief urged Al-Nuaimi to keep us 
briefed on their assistance efforts so that we 
could better coordinate and deconflict provision of 
needed assistance.
