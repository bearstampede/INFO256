OFFICIAL, BUT DON'T FORGET PALESTINE 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Richard A. 
Albright for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (C) Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) Deputy 
Managing Director Khalifa Al-Kindi queried DCM during a 
5/19 courtesy call about the future of Iraq and the roadmap 
for peace between Israel and the PA.  Clearly pleased by 
the outcome of the war in Iraq, Al-Kindi admitted that he 
had purchased the "Iraqi Deck Of Cards" from the Internet, 
and excused himself from the meeting to retrieve the deck 
in his office.  Al-Kindi noted that a dozen of the cards 
were without pictures of senior Baath officials -- "No 
wonder you haven't been able to catch them!"  Al-Kindi was 
pleased that the USG had turned its attention back to 
Israel and Palestine with the recent unveiling of the 
roadmap for peace.  Al-Kindi asked several reiterations of 
the same question about the feasibility of the USG plan, 
and seemed to seek DCM's assurances that Washington would 
deliver peace to the Middle East. 
 
¶3.  (C) Comment: Like many of our Emirati contacts, Al- 
Kindi displayed polite indifference toward us prior to the 
war, and his skepticism about U.S. initiatives in the 
region was evident in earlier meetings.  This meeting with 
Al-Kindi, however, was a marked difference -- he seemed 
elated that the war was over and that Coalition forces had 
removed Saddam from power.  Nevertheless, his body language 
and persistent questioning both about the future of Iraq 
and the peace process revealed concern as to whether we can 
make good on our promises and a desire to believe us.  Many 
of our senior interlocutors feel the same way.  End 
comment.
