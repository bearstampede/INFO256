SUBJECT: UAE'S REPRESENTATIVE TO OPEC "SURPRISED" BY 
DECISION TO CUT QUOTAS 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Economic Section Chief Oliver B. 
John, for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C) In a 9/28 meeting with Econ Chief, UAE 
Ministry of Petroleum Director of Economic Affairs and 
OPEC delegate Hamdan Al-Akbari said he was "a little 
bit surprised" by the organization's decision last 
week to cut output by 900,000 barrels per day.  Al- 
Akbari admitted that it was a strange position to take 
during the fourth quarter when demand for heating oil 
in the northern hemisphere would be expected to rise. 
 
¶3.  (C) Although Al-Akbari did not/not attend the OPEC 
meeting last week (he was returning to the UAE from 
the WTO meetings in Cancun), he speculated that the 
Iraqi delegate's presence at OPEC Headquarters might 
have influenced the decision.  He noted that the Iraqi 
Oil Minister has made some very bold statements 
earlier in the week at the IMF meetings in Dubai about 
ramping up Iraq's oil production, and these statements 
may have caused some concern among OPEC members.  Al- 
Akbari posited that downward pressure on oil prices 
and increased Russian production might also have led 
to OPEC's decision to cut quotas.  He also was not 
able to say which delegation had pushed for the 
change. 
 
¶4.  (C) Comment: Although Al-Akbari did not attend the 
OPEC meeting himself, he is privy to the UAE's OPEC 
strategy by virtue of his position as the Oil 
Ministry's head technocrat and, until very recently, 
Chief of Staff to the UAE Oil Minister.  Al-Akbari's 
remarks indicate that the UAEG did not plan to cut 
production at last week's meeting, but went along with 
the rest of the pack once it became clear that there 
was consensus for reducing quotas in November.  End 
comment.
