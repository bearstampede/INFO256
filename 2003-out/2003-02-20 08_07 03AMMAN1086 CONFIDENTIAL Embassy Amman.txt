SUBJECT: INS-APPROVED IRAQI REFUGEES AWAITING SAO CLEARANCE 
FACE INCREASING PRESSURES AND DIFFICULTIES IN JORDAN 
 
Classified By: DCM Greg Berry, per 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) AS REQUESTED BY PRM/A, THIS IS A BRIEF UPDATE 
ABOUT THE INCREASING PRESSURES AND DIFFICULTIES REPORTED IN 
THREE INS APPROVED REFUGEE CASES (13 PERSONS), PENDING THEIR 
SAO CLEARANCE.  WE NOTE THAT, WHILE THE APPLICANTS THEMSELVES 
ARE THE PRIME SOURCE OF INFORMATION IN TWO CASES, UNHCR AMMAN 
HAS CONFIRMED THE SITUATION OF THE THIRD, AND EXPRESSES 
CONCERN ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF IRAQI REFUGEES MORE 
BROADLY AS REGIONAL TENSIONS RISE. 
 
¶2.  (C) ONE OF THE CASES, JO-000626, WAS APPROVED IN THE JULY 
2001 INS MISSION AND WAS READY FOR TRAVEL IN SEPTEMBER 2001. 
NEW PROCEDURES IMPLEMENTED AFTER 9-11 REQUIRED US TO RESUBMIT 
HIS SAO REQUEST AND JO-000626 HAS BEEN PENDING EVER SINCE. 
DUE TO HIS LONG STAY IN JORDAN, JO-000626 CLAIMS THAT HE IS 
KNOWN TO THE IRAQI INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.  AS A RESULT, HE 
HAS TO KEEP A VERY LOW PROFILE AND RARELY LEAVES HIS HOUSE 
BECAUSE HE BELIEVES IRAQI INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WILL "CATCH" 
HIM IF HE LEAVES HIS HOUSE. 
 
¶3.  (C) ANOTHER CASE, JO-000711, CURRENTLY WORKS WITH THE 
IRAQI OPPOSITION, THE IRAQI NATIONAL ACCORD MOVEMENT (INA, AL 
WIFAQ) HERE IN JORDAN.  THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK FOR THE 
INA REPORTEDLY ARE REQUIRED TO SLEEP IN THEIR OFFICES BECAUSE 
THE INA BELIEVES IT IS NOT SAFE FOR THEM TO GO HOME DUE TO 
THE PRESENCE OF IRAQI INTELLIGENCE SERVICES IN JORDAN.  THEIR 
CHILDREN DO NOT GO TO SCHOOLS AND THEY HAVE LOCKED THEMSELVES 
IN THEIR HOMES AND CLOSED ALL THE DOORS AND SHUTTERS.  ALL 
REFUGEES WORKING WITH THE IRAQI OPPOSITION (E.G. IRAQI 
NATIONAL ACCORD MOVEMENT) CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD BY 
OFFICIALS WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TRAVEL TO THEIR RESETTLEMENT 
COUNTRIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THE REFUGEES REPORT THAT 
THERE ARE OTHER EVENTS OCCURRING BUT THE REFUGEES CANNOT 
DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION OVER THE PHONE AND IT IS UNSAFE FOR 
THEM TO APPROACH AMEMBASSY AMMAN. 
 
¶4.  (C) ACCORDING TO UNHCR AMMAN, THE THIRD CASE, JO-000712, 
HAS BEEN "TARGETED" BY IRAQI INTELLIGENCE AGENTS.  THE ENTIRE 
FAMILY HAS GONE INTO HIDING AND IS MOVED FROM ONE SAFE HOUSE 
TO ANOTHER ON A MONTHLY BASIS.  ONLY THE PROTECTION OFFICER 
AT UNHCR KNOWS THE FAMILY'S EXACT WHEREABOUTS.  THE SEVEN 
FAMILY MEMBERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.  THEY ARE 
TRYING TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE, WHICH IS PROVING TO BE QUITE 
DIFFICULT. 
 
¶5.  (C) UNHCR AMMAN REPORTS THAT THE PRESENCE OF IRAQI 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS IN JORDAN PRESENTS A PERMANENT RISK FOR 
IRAQI REFUGEES WHO LIVE IN CONSTANT FEAR OF BEING HARASSED OR 
HAVING THEIR LIVES THREATENED IN JORDAN.  IN GENERAL, IRAQI 
INTELLIGENCE CONTINUES TO SURVEIL AND HARASS SOME IRAQI 
REFUGEES HERE IN JORDAN.  THEIR ACTIVITIES AND MOTIONS ARE 
CONSTANTLY MONITORED.  REFUGEES REPORTEDLY HAVE BEEN ATTACKED 
ON THE STREETS AND HAVE HAD PEOPLE COME TO THEIR HOUSES 
SEARCHING FOR THEM.  WHEN THE REFUGEES LEAVE THEIR HOUSES, 
THEY ARE ALWAYS LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDERS. 
 
¶6.  (C) IN ADDITION, ACCORDING TO UNHCR'S MEMORANDUM OF 
UNDERSTANDING WITH THE GOJ, REFUGEES HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO 
REMAIN IN JORDAN ONLY SIX MONTHS AFTER THEY ARE RECOGNIZED AS 
REFUGEES BY UNHCR.  AFTERWARDS, THEY RISK BEING SUBJECTED TO 
DEPORTATION TO THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN (IN THIS CASE IRAQ). 
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT HEARD OF ANY CASES OF DEPORTATION OF 
UNHCR-RECOGNIZED REFUGEES, UNHCR IS INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS THAT 
THE GOJ WILL MOVE TO DEPORT RECOGNIZED REFUGEES WHO HAVE 
OVERSTAYED THEIR LEGAL RESIDENCY, PARTICULARLY IF CONDITIONS 
INSIDE JORDAN DETERIORATE. 
 
¶7.    (C) FINALLY, INCREASING TENSIONS IN THE REGION ARE 
MAKING THESE 13 INS-APPROVED REFUGEES INCREASINGLY NERVOUS 
ABOUT THEIR FATE.  IF WAR WERE TO OCCUR AND THE CURRENT 
REGIME IN IRAQ WERE TO CHANGE, THE REFUGEES WONDER WHETHER 
THEY WOULD BE RESETTLED OR GIVEN THE CHANCE TO RETURN HOME. 
WOULD THEY LOSE REFUGEE STATUS ONCE THE CAUSE FOR FEAR OF 
PERSECUTION IN THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN IS NO LONGER THERE? WE 
WOULD APPRECIATE GUIDANCE ON THESE QUESTIONS, AS WELL AS 
TIMELY REVIEW OF SAO CLEARANCES FOR THE CASES DESCRIBED ABOVE.
