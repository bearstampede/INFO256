SUBJECT:  UAE OIL OFFICIAL'S VIEWS ON IRAQ AND THE OIL 
MARKET 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard Albright, for reasons 1.5 
(B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C) The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company's (ADNOC) Deputy 
CEO, Abdullah Bin Nasser Al-Suwaidi does not believe that 
the oil market would collapse following a military conflict 
with Iraq and removal of Saddam Hussein from power.  In a 
March 3 meeting with Econchief and Econoff, Al-Suwaidi 
posited that oil prices would likely soften a bit -- to the 
$18-20 range -- if Iraq produced at full capacity, but would 
not drop significantly beyond that.  (Note: Others in the 
UAE government, including senior officials at the mammoth 
Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which makes the Emirates 
overseas portfolio investments, have privately expressed a 
concern that a drastic drop in oil prices is inevitable, 
down to possibly $8 a barrel.)  Al-Suwaidi elaborated that 
prices are artificially high right now, and that he recently 
signed contracts for the next two months fixing the UAE's 
signature 'Murban' crude at $34 per barrel. 
 
¶3.  (C) Al-Suwaidi does not believe that Iraq's oil 
production will increase substantially in the short term, 
and -- although cheap to produce -- Iraqi oil fields will 
require billions of dollars in investment and several years 
to realize their full potential.  He intimated that the 
Kirkuk and Basra fields, in particular, are in poor 
condition, having been producing for decades.  He also 
suggested that Iraq's claimed reserves may be overstated; in 
any case, he doubted that there are any large, undiscovered 
deposits of oil in Iraq.
