¶1. Transocean Sedco Forex Managing Director Ian Clark 
told Econoff May 5 that all hostages and striking oil 
workers had been safely removed from the company's 
four rigs off Port Harcourt. He said the rigs are not 
yet back in operation but have been fully staffed by a 
new group of workers. 
 
 
¶2. Clark emphasized that no concessions had been made 
to the striking workers, adding that his company had 
no plans yet to schedule additional talks with them.
