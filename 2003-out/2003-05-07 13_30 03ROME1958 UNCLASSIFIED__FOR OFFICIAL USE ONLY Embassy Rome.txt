¶1. (SBU) US MISSION HAS RECEIVED A WFP EXPANDED TEXT 
BUILDING ON REMARKS MADE BY WFP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JAMES 
MORRIS TO THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL ON APRIL 7 - REGARDING 
SUGGESTED STEPS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN TAKE 
NOW RELATED TO THE SERIOUS FOOD CRISES ENGULFING MUCH OF SUB- 
SAHARAN AFRICA. IN US MISSION'S VIEW, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 
"QUICK WINS" IN THESE WFP PROPOSALS, I.E., THE ABILITY TO 
MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WITH MODEST INVESTMENTS. WITH SOME 
38-40 MILLION AFRICANS IN 2003 LIVING WITH THE THREAT OF 
    STARVATION AND ANOTHER 156 MILLION WHO SUFFER QUIETLY THIS 
YEAR FROM CHRONIC HUNGER, THE EVIAN G8 SUMMIT PRESENTS A 
UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO CEMENT A BROADER POLITICAL COMMITMENT 
ON THE ISSUE OF AFRICAN HUNGER. END SUMMARY.

TEXT OF WFP PROPOSAL FOR G8 CONSIDERATION RELATED TO 
PREVENTING AND MITIGATING FOOD CRISES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) BEGIN WFP TEXT. "RECURRING FOOD CRISES IN SUB- 
SAHARAN AFRICA ARE AMONG THE FORMIDABLE CHALLENGES FACING 
THE WORLD COMMUNITY TODAY.  EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS, 
CONFLICT, FAILED ECONOMIC POLICIES, AND THE DEVASTATING 
IMPACT OF HIV/AIDS HAVE COMBINED TO CREATE MASSIVE NEEDS 
REQUIRING URGENT ACTION.  THE DRAMA SURROUNDING RECENT SHORT- 
TERM CRISES OBSCURES THE MORE 'SILENT' DISASTERS SUCH AS 
CHRONIC CHILD MALNUTRITION AND LACK OF EDUCATION THAT 
UNDERMINE THE POTENTIAL OF AFRICA'S MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE - 
ITS CHILDREN. 
 
ABOUT 196 MILLION AFRICANS ARE UNDERNOURISHED, WITH OVER 40 
MILLION NOW SUFFERING SEVERE FOOD SHORTAGES.  THEY NEED 
IMMEDIATE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, AS WELL AS PROGRAMMES TO 
IMPROVE CHILD HEALTH, TRAIN AND EDUCATE WORKFORCES, REDUCE 
THE VULNERABILITY OF PEOPLE TO DISASTERS AND PROMOTE 
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.  HOWEVER, MONEY ALONE IS NOT A 
GUARANTOR OF SUCCESS.  AFRICAN LEADERS WILL NEED TO COMMIT 
TO BUILDING DEMOCRATIC NATIONS WITH LEADERS WHO ARE 
ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR CITIZENS AND TO ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT 
SOUND POLICIES THAT DRAW PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND PROMOTE 
    ECONOMIC GROWTH.  THEY MUST ALSO COMMIT MORE OF THEIR OWN 
RESOURCES IN AGRICULTURE, EDUCATION AND SAFETY NETS FOR 
VULNERABLE GROUPS. 
 
THE NEPAD INITIATIVE IS AN EXCELLENT SIGN OF THE POSITIVE 
COMMITMENT AMONG SOME AFRICAN LEADERS TOWARDS THE 
CONTINENT'S DEVELOPMENT.  IT DESERVES THE FULL SUPPORT OF G8 
MEMBERS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION.  MOREOVER, THE 
MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND THE G8 AFRICA ACTION PLAN 
PROVIDE FRAMEWORKS FOR EXPANDED PARTNERSHIP WITH AFRICA TO 
PROMOTE PEACE, SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT - ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS 
FOR CRISIS PREVENTION AND RESPONSE. 
 
PREVENTING AND RESPONDING EFFECTIVELY TO FOOD CRISES IN 
AFRICA WILL REQUIRE INITIATIVES INVOLVING A RANGE OF ACTORS. 
FOR INSTANCE, INEQUITIES IN TRADE THAT WORK AGAINST THE 
AFRICAN FARMER AND CREATE DISINCENTIVES FOR AGRICULTURAL 
PRODUCTION WILL NEED TO BE REVERSED.  THIS WILL REQUIRE 
SOUND NATIONAL AND GLOBAL TRADE POLICIES, IMPROVED 
AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY, SKILLS AND INPUTS AND INVESTMENTS 
 
ROME 00001958  002 OF 005 
 
 PRODUCED.  ALSO, THE G8 
SHOULD REINVIGORATE ITS POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT WITH AFRICA, 
CONSISTENT WITH ITS COMMITMENTS IN KANANASKIS, TO HELP 
RESOLVE EXISTING CONFLICTS AND PREVENT NEW ONES. 
 
THIS PAPER CONTAINS A NUMBER OF NEAR TERM AND SPECIFIC IDEAS 
ON WHAT WFP AND ITS PARTNERS IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
CAN DO AS PART OF THIS BROADER STRATEGY, TO MAKE EMERGENCY 
RESPONSES TO FOOD CRISES MORE EFFECTIVE AND BUILD THE 
CAPACITY OF AFRICAN NATIONS THEMSELVES TO PREVENT THEM. 
 
¶I.  IMMEDIATE AND FEASIBLE ACTIONS 
 
(A)  FULLY FUND CURRENT HUMANITARIAN PROGRAMS 
 
WFP'S EXISTING REQUIREMENTS ALREADY FALL SHORT OF TOTAL 
NEEDS IN AFRICA.  AS OF APRIL 2003, WFP NEEDED AN ADDITIONAL 
    U.S. DOLLARS 1 BILLION TO PURCHASE AND DISTRIBUTE SOME 1.9 
MILLION TONS OF EMERGENCY FOOD AID TO CRISIS-AFFECTED 
AFRICANS. WFP'S TOTAL AFRICA PORTFOLIO FOR EMERGENCIES 
STANDS AT AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF USD 1.8 BILLION, 
EQUIVALENT TO THE TOTAL RESOURCES WFP RECEIVED WORLD-WIDE 
FOR ALL PROJECTS AND OPERATIONS IN 2002. (NOTE: UPDATED WFP 
FIGURES WILL BE AVAILABLE ON MAY 9. END NOTE.)  TO MAXIMIZE 
EFFECTIVENESS, THE LONGER-TERM DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OF WFP 
AND OTHER UN AGENCIES IN WATER, SANITATION, HEALTH, 
AGRICULTURE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS ALSO DESERVE INCREASED 
SUPPORT. 
 
(B) `TWINNING.' - FACILITATE FOOD AID DONATIONS FROM NEW 
DONORS 
 
SUBSTANTIAL FOOD SURPLUSES EXIST IN SOME DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BECOMING FOOD AID DONORS, 
BUT MOST LACK THE ASSOCIATED CASH TO PAY FOR FOOD DELIVERY 
AND DISTRIBUTION.  G8 AND OTHER DONORS COULD HELP DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES BECOME FOOD AID DONORS BY ESTABLISHING A FUND TO 
MATCH COMMODITY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM EMERGING DONORS WITH THE 
ASSOCIATED CASH FOR TRANSPORT, STORAGE, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MANAGEMENT OF DONATED COMMODITIES.  CASH CONTRIBUTIONS MADE 
IN THIS WAY CAN LEVERAGE CONSIDERABLY MORE FOOD AID FOR 
HUNGRY PEOPLE.  FOR EXAMPLE, A CASH CONTRIBUTION OF U.S. 
DOLLARS 20 MILLION COULD LEVERAGE A DONATION OF 100,000 
METRIC TONS FROM SOUTH AFRICA FOR DROUGHT VICTIMS IN ZAMBIA. 
THIS TRANSACTION WOULD OTHERWISE COST AROUND U.S. DOLLARS 40 
MILLION. OUR SPECIFIC PROPOSAL IS TO ESTABLISH A SPECIAL 
FUND WITHIN WFP NAMED `THE G-8 FUND FOR EMERGING DONORS'. 
THE FUND WOULD BE FINANCED BY G-8 MEMBERS BUT NON-G-8 
    MEMBERS WOULD BE INVITED TO CONTRIBUTE. THE FUND COULD BE 
ESTABLISHED AT USD 500 MILLION, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT 
ONE QUARTER OF WFP'S EXPENDITURE IN 2002. (NOTE. IT WOULD 
ALSO BE POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN 
ENDOWMENT FUND. AN ENDOWMENT WOULD INVOLVE MUCH LARGER 
INITIAL CONTRIBUTIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE CURRENT POOR 
INVESTMENT CLIMATE. IT WOULD, HOWEVER, REDUCE THE NEED FOR 
REGULAR REPLENISHMENT. END NOTE.)  THE FUND WOULD BE 
SEPARATELY MANAGED AND ACCOUNTED FOR BY WFP; AND IT WOULD BE 
SUBJECT TO AUDIT ACCORDING TO WFP'S FINANCIAL REGULATIONS. 
 
(C) IMPROVE THE CAPACITY FOR EARLY RESPONSE 
 
A KEY TO SAVING LIVES AND REDUCING FUTURE NEEDS IN A CRISIS 
IS TO RESPOND EARLY, BEFORE PEOPLE SELL THEIR ASSETS OR GO 
INTO DEBT, MAKING THEMSELVES EVEN MORE VULNERABLE IN THE 
FUTURE.  WFP ALREADY HAS A MECHANISM IN PLACE TO PROVIDE 
FUNDING FOR THE EARLIEST PHASES OF AN OPERATION, A REVOLVING 
AND REPLENISHABLE FUND CALLED THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ACCOUNT 
(IRA). HOWEVER, THIS USD 35 MILLION FUND, ESTABLISHED SOME 
 
ROME 00001958  003 OF 005 
 
OVER ONLY TWO WEEKS WORTH OF 
FOOD IN OUR CURRENT EMERGENCY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. WHAT WE 
NOW NEED IS A USD 300 MILLION AFRICAN FOOD EMERGENCY FUND, 
WHICH WOULD PROVIDE FAST ACCESS TO CASH AT THE OUTSET OF A 
FOOD CRISIS. THIS WOULD VASTLY STRENGTHEN THE SPEED WITH 
WHICH WFP CAN RESPOND, ALLOWING WFP TO BUY FOOD 
LOCALLY/REGIONALLY, HIRE TRANSPORT, SET UP COMMUNICATIONS 
AND FILL BREAKS IN FOOD AID PIPELINES. WE WOULD ENCOURAGE 
OTHER UN AGENCIES TO SEEK SIMILAR IMMEDIATE RESPONSE 
ACCOUNTS FOR AFRICA AS WE HAVE REPEATEDLY SEEN THAT 
DONATIONS TO MEET NON FOOD NEEDS - CLEAN WATER, MEDICINES, 
SEEDS - MATERIALISE AT AN EVEN SLOWER RATE THAN THOSE FOR 
FOOD. 
 
(D) ESTABLISH A FAMINE RISK INSURANCE SCHEME 
 
DONORS TEND TO CONTRIBUTE GENERALLY TO EMERGENCY RESPONSE, 
    BUT THEIR DONATIONS TRICKLE IN OVER THE LIFE-TIME OF A 
PROJECT, CAUSING PLANNING PROBLEMS AND BREAKS IN THE FOOD 
PIPELINE.  WFP IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING A "FAMINE RISK 
INSURANCE SCHEME", WHICH WOULD SHIFT THE BURDEN OF RISK - 
CAUSED BY UNEVEN FUNDING COMMITMENTS AND THE LACK OF 
NATIONAL INSURANCE -- FROM CRISIS-AFFECTED BENEFICIARIES TO 
WFP AND ITS DONORS.  A FAMINE RISK INSURANCE SCHEME WOULD 
INVOLVE UP-FRONT FUNDING, BY WFP, TO ITS COUNTRY OFFICES ON 
THE BASIS OF A CALCULATION OF THE "NET PRESENT VALUE" OF AN 
EMERGENCY PROJECT.  IF WFP NEEDED TO BORROW FUNDS TO 
FACILITATE THIS, IT WOULD REQUEST THE WORLD BANK TO ISSUE 
DISCOUNT NOTES, OR "HUNGER BONDS", WHICH WOULD BE 
SUBSEQUENTLY REPLENISHED THROUGH CASH AND IN-KIND 
COMMITMENTS.  DONORS, INCLUDING THE G-8, COULD PROVIDE 
OVERSIGHT THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND ACT AS A RE-INSURER OF 
WFP, PLEDGING TO STEP IN SHOULD WFP NOT BE ABLE TO MEET ITS 
DEBT-SERVICING REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WOULD PERMIT WFP TO 
BORROW AT THE SAME ADVANTAGEOUS RATES AS THE WORLD BANK. 
 
II.  STEPS TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HUNGER AND FOOD AID 
REQUIREMENTS. 
 
(E) STRENGTHEN ANALYSIS OF VULNERABILITY AND FOOD INSECURITY 
 
MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO HELP NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS, WFP 
AND DONORS PINPOINT THE PEOPLE MOST VULNERABLE TO HUNGER AND 
DETERMINE WHETHER FOOD AID IS AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO 
THEIR NEEDS.  AN INVESTMENT OF USD 5 MILLION COULD HELP 
EXPAND VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS AND MAPPING (VAM) TO 13 
ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.  THIS WOULD 
INCLUDE UPDATING VAM WORK ALREADY DONE IN SEVEN COUNTRIES 
    AND BUILDING VAM CAPACITY WITHIN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS, 
ENHANCING THEIR EFFORTS TO CONDUCT FOOD SECURITY 
ASSESSMENTS, ANALYSIS AND PLANNING.  WFP'S VAM UNITS WORK 
CLOSELY WITH FAO'S GLOBAL INFORMATION EARLY WARNING SYSTEM 
AND USAID'S FAMINE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM NETWORK AND DRAW ON 
A RANGE OF INFORMATION FROM SATELLITE IMAGERY OF RAINFALL 
AND CROP CONDITIONS TO COMMUNITY-LEVEL MONITORING OF MARKET 
FOOD PRICES. 
 
(F) IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF RISKS 
 
WFP AND PARTNERS WOULD DEVELOP A BROADER ANALYTICAL 
FRAMEWORK THAT INCORPORATES THE RANGE OF HAZARDS (DROUGHT, 
FLOOD, CONFLICT, HIV/AIDS PREVALENCE, ETC.) THAT CONTRIBUTE 
TO FAMINE AND IDENTIFY HIGH-RISK AREAS.  IN ADDITION, THEY 
WOULD BUILD NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CAPACITY TO 
TRACK THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT HAZARDS OVER TIME. 
 
(G) SUPPORT RELIABLE AND TIMELY EMERGENCY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS 
 
ROME 00001958  004 OF 005 
 
GET FOOD AND OTHER 
ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE IN CRISIS.  AN ESTIMATED USD 3 MILLION 
WOULD HELP TO STRENGTHEN EMERGENCY ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES, 
PROVIDE TRAINING FOR NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL 
BODIES AND ESTABLISH A SYSTEM TO COMPARE NEEDS WITHIN SUB- 
SAHARAN AFRICA.  OVER TWO YEARS, THIS PROCESS WOULD SEEK TO 
BUILD CONSENSUS AMONG INTERNATIONAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL 
BODIES RESPONSIBLE FOR FOOD SECURITY ASSESSMENTS AND, ON 
THAT BASIS, REVISE EMERGENCY NEEDS ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES TO 
BETTER INTEGRATE MICRO (HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY), MACRO 
(NATIONAL FOOD GAP AND MARKET), LIVELIHOOD AND NUTRITION 
ANALYSIS.  IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE DEVELOPING A SYSTEM THAT 
TRACKS AND COMPARES EMERGENCY FOOD AID NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND 
REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA COUNTRIES. 
 
III.  MEASURES TO ENHANCE EARLY EARNING AND PREPAREDNESS IN 
AFRICA 

(H) EARLY WARNING AND PREPAREDNESS ARE CRUCIAL ELEMENTS FOR 
QUICK AND TARGETED RESPONSES. KEY PARTNERS IN EARLY WARNING 
AND PREPAREDNESS INCLUDE AFRICAN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND 
REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS, WFP, FAO, USAID'S FAMINE EARLY 
WARNING SYSTEM NETWORK (FEWSNET) AND SPECIALIZED 
INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE 
FOR CLIMATE PREDICTION, THE UN WORLD METEOROLOGICAL 
ORGANIZATION AND THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC 
ADMINISTRATION.  A RELATIVELY SMALL INVESTMENT OF USD 7.5 
MILLION OVER A 3-YEAR PERIOD, WITH ANNUAL RUNNING COSTS OF 
USD 1 MILLION, WOULD PERMIT WFP AND ITS PARTNERS TO IMPROVE 
AFRICAN EARLY WARNING AND PREPAREDNESS SYSTEMS, AND ENSURE 
LINKAGES AMONG THESE SYSTEMS. 
 
(I) REVIEW EXISTING EARLY WARNING AND RESPONSE SYSTEMS 
 
WFP AND PARTNERS WOULD REVIEW AND ASSESS EXISTING NATIONAL 
AND REGIONAL RESOURCES, CAPACITIES AND PRACTICES IN EARLY 
WARNING, PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE, WHICH VARY CONSIDERABLE 
WITHIN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.  THIS WOULD INCLUDE MAPPING 
RESOURCES AND CAPACITIES, COLLECTING BEST PRACTICES, AND 
DEVELOPING COMMON OPERATIONAL STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES.  IT 
WOULD ALSO INCLUDE REVIEWING NATIONAL STRATEGIC GRAIN 
RESERVES AND THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE FOR THEIR USE AND 
REPLENISHMENT. 
 
(J) STRENGTHEN EARLY WARNING, PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
NETWORKS 
 
WFP AND PARTNERS WOULD WORK WITH NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND 
    REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO ESTABLISH AN INTERNET-BASED SYSTEM 
THAT BRINGS TOGETHER UP-TO-DATE FORECASTING OF DROUGHTS, 
CYCLONES AND OTHER HAZARDS FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.  THIS 
WOULD INCLUDE ESTABLISHING COMMON HAZARD ALERT LEVELS.  IN 
ADDITION, THEY WOULD PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ENHANCE 
AFRICAN NATIONAL AND REGIONAL CAPACITIES IN EMERGENCY 
PREPAREDNESS, CONTINGENCY AND OPERATIONAL PLANNING AND BUILD 
PARTNERSHIPS WITHIN AFRICA TO PROMOTE SHARING OF 
INFORMATION, HUMAN RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE AMONG COUNTRIES 
BEFORE AND DURING FOOD CRISES. 
 
IV.  INVESTMENTS IN NUTRITION AND PRIMARY SCHOOL EDUCATION 
 
(K) ESTABLISH NUTRITIONAL MONITORING 
 
MORE EFFECTIVE NUTRITIONAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS FOR SUB- 
SAHARA AFRICA COULD PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION IN "NORMAL" 
YEARS' AND IN TIMES OF CRISIS.  AN INVESTMENT OF USD 11.4 
MILLION, WITH ANNUAL RUNNING COSTS OF USD 1.9 MILLION, WOULD 
ALLOW WFP TO WORK WITH NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER 
 
ROME 00001958  005 OF 005 
 
ICA.  REPUTABLE 
NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS/UNIVERSITIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 
COULD BE POTENTIAL COLLABORATORS, WHICH WOULD HELP ENSURE 
SUSTAINABILITY. 
 
(L) IMPROVE AND EXTEND NATIONAL CAPACITIES IN NUTRITION 
INTERVENTION 
 
WFP WOULD SEEK TO PROVIDE TRAINING IN EMERGENCY NUTRITION 
ANALYSIS AND RESPONSE FOR NATIONAL COUNTERPARTS IN 38 
COUNTRIES OVER FIVE YEARS.  AN ESTIMATED USD 2 MILLION WOULD 
BE REQUIRED FOR THIS EFFORT. 
 
(M) FORTIFY FOOD WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 
 
BUILDING AFRICAN CAPACITY TO FORTIFY FOOD WITH IMPORTANT 
MICRONUTRIENTS WOULD HAVE DRAMATIC EFFECTS ON HEALTH, 
    PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY AND MORTALITY RATES IN THE REGION. 
THESE EFFORTS, WHICH WOULD COST AN ESTIMATED USD 6.8 
MILLION, WOULD INCLUDE WORKING WITH PARTNERS TO INVENTORY 
MILLING AND FORTIFICATION CAPACITY BY COUNTRY; BUILD 
ALLIANCES TO INCREASE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF FORTIFICATION 
ACTIVITIES; ESTABLISH SMALL-SCALE MILLS TO ADDRESS 
MICRONUTRIENT NEEDS IN REMOTE AREAS; AND CREATE AND PILOT 
MOBILE MILLS FOR USE IN SUDDEN ONSET AND REFUGEE 
EMERGENCIES. 
 
(N) GET CHILDREN TO SCHOOL 
 
THE LONG-TERM FUTURE OF AFRICA WILL DEPEND GREATLY ON A WELL 
NOURISHED, EDUCATED AND SKILLED WORKFORCE.  WFP WOULD LIKE 
TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NEPAD TO GET ALL PRIMARY SCHOOL- 
AGED AFRICAN CHILDREN TO ATTEND SCHOOL THROUGH SUPPORT FOR 
SCHOOL FEEDING ACTIVITIES.  AN INITIAL ANNUAL INVESTMENT OF 
USD 300 MILLION, TO BE GRADUALLY INCREASED TO USD 2 BILLION 
ANNUALLY BY 2015, WOULD PERMIT WFP TO SUPPORT THE EDUCATION 
FOR ALL INITIATIVE BY EXPANDING SCHOOL FEEDING TO REACH MOST 
OF THE 40-50 MILLION OUT-OF SCHOOL CHILDREN TO BENEFIT FROM 
PRIMARY SCHOOL EDUCATION.  BY WORKING WITH PARTNERS TO 
PROVIDE DEWORMING AND MOSQUITO NETS TO EACH CHILD AND 
ENSURING THAT SCHOOLS HAVE CLEAN WATER AND HIV/AIDS 
AWARENESS PROGRAMS, WFP WOULD ALSO PROMOTE CHILD HEALTH AND 
ENSURE CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO BENEFIT FULLY FROM THE 
NUTRITIONAL CONTENT OF THEIR FOOD."
