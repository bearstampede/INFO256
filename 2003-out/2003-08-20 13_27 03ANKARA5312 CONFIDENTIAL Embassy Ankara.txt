(C) Although Turkey is not yet an EU accession state and will 
not participate in the August 29 Rome meeting, PolMilOff 
shared reftel points with MFA NATO officer Esra Dogan August 
Â¶19.  PolMilOff emphasized that because the US and Turkey had 
often shared common views on ESDP and had coordinated so 
successfully in the past, the US hoped that the GOT would 
echo reftel concerns to its European contacts in the coming 
weeks.  (MFA had previously informed the Embassy that GOT 
officials were planning to visit European capitols to explain 
its interest in participation in the Iraq stabilization 
force.)  Dogan noted that the GOT shared US concerns about 
duplicative institutions to the detriment of both 
capabilities investment and transparency with NATO.  She said 
she would notify her superiors of the US points.
