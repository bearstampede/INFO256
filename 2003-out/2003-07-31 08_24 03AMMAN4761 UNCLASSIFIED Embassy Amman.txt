SUBJECT: MEET U.S. FOLLOW-UP:  JORDAN 
 
REF: USDOC 3592 
 
¶1.  (u)  Embassy appreciates DOC feedback from the first MEET 
U.S. conference.  Regarding the proposed issue areas for 
future MEET U.S. programs listed reftel, we believe it will 
be easy to find a solid group of qualified applicants for 
virtually any sector-specific program.  Reftel suggestions 
for education services, health technologies, irrigation and 
water treatment technologies, airport and port management, 
hotel management, and hospitality/tourism would all be 
welcome programs in Jordan.  We might expand the irrigation 
proposal to include environmental technologies more broadly 
(in keeping with the Environmental provisions of the 
Jordan-U.S. FTA), and would add banking/financial services 
and health sector services/hospital management to the list. 
 
¶2.  (u)  Regarding format options, Embassy would be happy to 
continue recruitment of participants for group programs.  We 
would also be willing to support an internship program as 
outlined reftel.  Support for either, as noted reftel, would 
be dependent on available MEPI funding. 
 
¶3.  (u)  Embassy looks forward to working with DOC on the 
MEET U.S. program as it develops.
