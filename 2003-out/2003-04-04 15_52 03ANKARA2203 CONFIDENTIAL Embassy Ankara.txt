(C) Ambassador spoke to MFA U/S Ziyal 1830 local April 4. 
Ziyal said there was no impediment to commercial supplies and 
civilian trucks moving to Habur Gate and no problem with 
crossing the border into Northern Iraq.  Based on that 
information, Ambassador informed Task Force North that they 
could initiate the movement of trucks and supplies into Iraq. 
 Embassy will monitor the first movements of trucks to make 
sure there are no hitches in the transport of supplies.
