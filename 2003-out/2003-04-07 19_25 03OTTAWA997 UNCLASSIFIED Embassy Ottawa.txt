Canada will continue to consult with the US in preparation 
for the May WTO services meetings, according to Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade Director for Services 
Trade Policy Paul Robertson.  Robertson, who has been in 
regular contact with USTR, noted the U.S. offer had been 
presaged in prior bilateral discussions and the Quad. 
Robertson said he saw no surprises, but had disseminated the 
talking points to working groups within the GOC and will 
provide us with a more detailed reaction prior to the May 
meetings.
