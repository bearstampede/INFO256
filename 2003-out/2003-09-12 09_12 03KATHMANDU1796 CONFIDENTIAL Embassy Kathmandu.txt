Summary 
======== 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On September 12, Maoists continued their wave of 
violence in urban areas.  A Maoist hit squad killed two 
people in northern Kathmandu.  The Maoists planted two bombs 
on the rim of Kathmandu Valley; one detonated causing USD 
2,700 in damage.  Four bombs exploded in an industrial city 
222 kms south of Kathmandu, killing one.  The bombings are 
intended to cow the public into observing the Maoists' 
September 18-20 general strike.  End summary. 
 
Maoist Hit Squad Kills an Informant and Witness 
============================================= === 
 
¶2.  (C) On the morning of September 12, a Maoist hit squad 
shot and killed grocery store owner Rameswore Shrestha and 
stationery store owner Dipendra Thapa, as they were opening 
their shops in northern Kathmandu (approximately 1.5 miles 
north of the Embassy).  According to police sources, Shrestha 
was a police informant, reportedly providing information on 
the Maoists, and was affiliated with the Prime Minister's 
National Democratic Party (RPP).  Thapa appears to have been 
killed as a witness to the crime.  The press reports one 
arrest. 
 
Two Bombs in the Valley 
======================== 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The press reported and police sources confirm that 
a bomb exploded at the Jitpur municipal office, 15 kms east 
of Kathmandu.  Although no injuries were reported, the 
explosion caused an estimated USD 2,700 in damage.  A 
separate improvised explosive device was reportedly 
discovered in the village of Matatirtha, 9 kms west of 
Kathmandu, and successfully defused by the Royal Nepalese 
Army. 
 
Indiscriminate Bombing Campaign Continues 
======================================== 
 
¶4.  (C) Four bombs were detonated in and around the city of 
Hetauda, 222 kms south of Kathmandu, killing one.  The 
devices were targeted at the police post of the Hetauda 
Industrial Estate, the Election Commission Office, the 
Hetauda Municipality Office, and a store.  An American 
citizen had left the shop shortly before the blast.  Police 
sources report that the bomb was placed at the business 
because the owner had refused to meet Maoist extortion 
demands. 
 
Comment 
======== 
 
¶5.  (C) The Maoists' bombings are intended to cow the public 
into observing their general strike, called for 18-20 
September.  The execution of the reported informant is a 
return to standard Maoist practices done prior to the 
cease-fire.  The bombing of the shop in Hetauda highlights 
the risk the Maoists' indiscriminate bombing campaign poses 
to American citizens.  However, while the store is a regular 
shopping place for American citizens in the area, there is no 
information to indicate that American citizens are Maoist 
targets (reftel).
