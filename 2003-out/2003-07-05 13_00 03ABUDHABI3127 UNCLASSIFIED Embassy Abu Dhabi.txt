On 7 July, Econchief delivered Ref A demarche to MFA 
International Organizations Department Director Ambassador 
Mohammed Jassim Samhan Al-Nuaimi.  Al-Nuaimi stated that the 
UAEG shares the USG's opposition to human cloning and supports 
the Costa Rican draft resolution.  He indicated, however, that 
the UAEG would not co-sponsor the resolution.  Al-Nuaimi further 
noted that he had reviewed the USG priorities at UNGA (see Ref 
B), and agrees generally in principle with all.
