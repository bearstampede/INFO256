¶1. (C)  I was delighted to learn you will be passing through 
Amman later this week.  I was preparing a message to protest 
you giving us only a few hours because there are some 
excellent programs here that we would have liked to share 
with you.  Unfortunately, I have learned that the King (and 
GID Director Saad Kheir) are now planning to be out of the 
country at the time of your visit.  They would be the two 
people I would most want you to meet. 
 
¶2.  (C)  As to the Mission welcome, be assured.  I would like 
to have the opportunity for you to meet with several of our 
senior staff.  We can do it in whatever manner and at 
whatever time you prefer.  I have three suggestions: drinks 
at the Residence, a light supper (knowing you may well have 
had as much food as you would like), or breakfast at the 
Residence the next morning before our departure for Baghdad. 
The latter would depend on your departure time. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Again, welcome.  We look forward to seeing you.  Let 
me know how I may best assist you.  Regards. 
GNEHM
