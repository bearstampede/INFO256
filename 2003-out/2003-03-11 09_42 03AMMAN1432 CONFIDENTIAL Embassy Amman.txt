 SUMMARY 
 ------- 
 
¶1. (C) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently announced 
formation of a "Human Rights Directorate" within the MFA.  On 
March 5, MFA Human Rights Officer Bisher Khasawneh told 
PolCouns and PolOff the MFA wants the new directorate to 
"have teeth", and is committed to providing HR training for 
as many as six Jordanian diplomats.  Khasawneh asked for 
Embassy assistance in facilitating this training.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (C)  On March 5, PolCouns and PolOff met with Bisher 
Khasawneh, newly appointed MFA officer (note: Khasawneh is 
also the MFA's Director of the Information and Public 
Relations Bureau).  Khasawneh said FM Muasher wants the HR 
Directorate to "have teeth".  It is designed to work 
initially with international NGOs and Embassies here in 
Amman.  Khasawneh hopes to be able to train up to six 
Jordanian diplomats at private institutions in either Europe 
or the US, and asked if the USG would be able to assist 
financially.  PolCouns said we would take a look at our 
programming funds, but advised that funding may be difficult, 
especially since enrollment in US private institutions is 
particularly expensive.  Khasawneh took the point, and said 
he is willing to consider alternatives such as training at 
the Embassy, perhaps by an FSI HR expert.

COMMENT

¶3.  (C)  The MFA's initiative to set up a HR Directorate is a 
good step, and in line with the GOJ's recently announced HR 
Commission, as well as a recent request by the Ministry of 
Social Development to assist with HR training of their staff. 
 We will look into avenues through which we can help 
facilitate training for the MFA's HR Directorate, including 
possible use of the international visitors program, voluntary 
visitors program, or MEPI funds.
