SUBJECT: ITALY HOLDS UP SHIPMENT OF FAST BOATS TO IRAN 
 
REF: A. ROME 562 
 
     ¶B. ROME 445 
     ¶C. ROME 399 AND PREVIOUS 
     ¶D. STATE 29285 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION SCOTT KILNER 
FOR REASONS 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
¶1. (S) FOLLOWING ANOTHER EMBASSY INQUIRY TO THE MFA ON 
FEBRUARY 11, GIUSEPPE MANZO, SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO DIRECTOR 
GENERAL FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS MARCELLO SPATAFORA, TOLD ECONOFF 
FEBRUARY 12 THAT SPATAFORA HAD CONTACTED THE ITALIAN COMPANY 
SB DESIGN TWO DAYS AGO TO ASK THEM TO HALT THE IMPENDING 
SHIPMENT OF HIGH-SPEED PATROL BOATS TO IRAN. MANZO SAID THE 
COMPANY ACCEDED TO SPATAFORA'S REQUEST, PROMISING NOT TO 
DELIVER AT THIS TIME A SHIPMENT OF TWO CONTAINERS EXPECTED TO 
LEAVE THE COMPANY'S PLANT IN LOMBARDY FOR NAPLES WITHIN DAYS. 
(MANZO DID NOT KNOW HOW MANY BOATS WOULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED 
IN THE DELIVERY, NOR COULD HE EXPLAIN THE DISCREPANCY WITH 
OUR INFORMATION THAT THE BOATS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED IN NAPLES, 
PER REF D.) 
 
¶2. (S) MANZO EMPHASIZED THAT SPATAFORA'S REQUEST HAD BEEN 
"UNOFFICIAL AND UNORTHODOX" AND DONE OUTSIDE OF ANY FORMAL 
GOI AUTHORITY, AND THAT THE ULTIMATE "DECISION" TO HALT THE 
SHIPMENTS HAD BEEN THAT OF SB DESIGN.  MANZO ALSO 
CHARACTERIZED THE SHIPMENT AS BEING HALTED "FOR THE MOMENT." 
 
¶3. (S) COMMENT: SB DESIGN'S COOPERATION WITH THE GOI'S 
REQUEST MAY BE LINKED TO ITS APPARENT DESIRE (CONVEYED TO US 
EARLIER BY MFA NON PROLIFERATION COORDINATOR DE MOHR) TO WIN 
A MUCH MORE LUCRATIVE CONTRACT WITH THE ITALIAN GUARDIA DI 
FINANZA (CUSTOMS/IMMIGRATION POLICE). DE MOHR ALSO TOLD US 
THAT, FOR "BUSINESS REASONS," THE COMPANY HAS DECIDED NOT TO 
PURSUE FURTHER SALES IN IRAN. 
 
¶4. (S) COMMENT CONT:  WE WILL NEED TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE MFA 
TO ENSURE THAT THIS TEMPORARY HOLD BECOMES PERMANENT.  FOR 
THE MOMENT, HOWEVER, IT APPEARS CLEAR THAT THE GOI HAS HEARD 
OUR MESSAGE AND ACTED UPON IT TO PREVENT HANDING US A FAIT 
ACCOMPLI.  END COMMENT.
