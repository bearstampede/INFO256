E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL PREF HR YI
SUBJECT: MESIC ON REFUGEE RETURNS 
 
REF: A. (A) BELGRADE 2248 
     ¶B. (B) ZAGREB 2004 
 
¶1.  (SBU) WE READ WITH INTEREST REFTEL A IN WHICH SAM FOREIGN 
MINISTER GORAN SVILANOVIC SAID HE WELCOMED THE INITIATIVE OF 
CROATIAN PRESIDENT STIPE MESIC FOR A TRIPARTITE MEETING OF 
CROATIA, BOSNIA, AND THE SAM TO TAKE UP REFUGEE ISSUES. 

¶2.  (SBU) SINCE THE SUBJECT HAD NOT COME UP IN OUR FIRST READ 
OUT OF THE CROATIAN PRESIDENT'S SEPTEMBER 10 VISIT TO 
BELGRADE (REF B), WE ASKED MESIC'S ASSISTANT FOREIGN POLICY 
ADVISOR, TOMISLAV CAR, ABOUT IT AGAIN ON SEPTEMBER 22.  HE 
CONFIRMED THAT, YES, THE SUBJECT CAME UP, BUT ONLY VERY 
BRIEFLY.  WHEN MESIC RAISED THE IDEA, SAM PRESIDENT MAROVIC 
AND FOREIGN MINISTER SVILANOVIC AGREED THAT REFUGEES SHOULD 
BE DEALT WITH IN THE CONTEXT OF THE THREE COUNTRIES.  BUT 
CAR, WHO ACCOMPANIED MESIC ON THE TRIP, SAID THERE WAS 
NOTHING BEYOND A FEW ANODYNE WORDS ON THE SUBJECT.  ACCORDING 
TO THE MESIC STAFFER, THERE HAS BEEN NO FOLLOW UP WHATSOEVER 
TO REVIVE THE IDEA SINCE PRESIDENT MESIC RETURNED TO ZAGREB. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT: A TRIPARTITE SUMMIT WOULD BE SENSITIVE 
POLITICALLY IN CROATIA.  WITH THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT FACING 
ELECTIONS AS EARLY AS NOVEMBER, WE WOULD NOT EXPECT PRESIDENT 
MESIC TO PUSH FOR A MEETING ANYTIME SOON.
