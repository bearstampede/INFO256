SUBJECT:  UAEG and Iraq ferry operator submit 
letters to Sanctions Committee 
 
REF:  DUBAI 300 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Charge Thomas E. Williams 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C)  UK DCM contacted Charge 2/8 to inquire into 
USG representations to the UAE on the issue of the Iraq 
ferries.  The UK diplomat noted that the UAEG was 
claiming in New York to have the support of the U.S. 
Embassy for the establishment of a U.N.-approved cargo 
inspection facility in Dubai.  Charge noted that our 
consistent position is that the ferries are not 
authorized to carry cargo, only passengers.  The UK 
Consul-General in Dubai subsequently provided CG Dubai 
with texts of letters from the UAE's U.N. mission in 
New York to the 661 Committee (the latest dated 1/31) 
alleging -- based on a letter from UAE ferry operator 
Naif Marine Services -- that an "agreement" has been 
reached between Naif and "the MIF (Marine (sic) 
Interdiction Force) and the United States Embassy in 
Abu Dhabi" to allow inspection of cargo at Port Rashid 
by "an independent representative reporting to the 661 
Committee." 
 
¶3.  (C)  This representation by Naif Marine Services, 
repeated by the UAE mission, is simply incorrect.  The 
idea of establishing a U.N. inspection facility at Port 
Rashid is an old one, which has been consistently 
rebuffed because the ferries are not authorized by the 
U.N. to carry cargo -- legitimate, inspected, or 
otherwise.  This clear message was most recently 
delivered by the Ambassador directly to Dubai's de 
facto ruler, Shaykh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum 
(MBR) in January (see reftel).  We believe Naif is 
deliberately seeking to misrepresent our position now 
because without the cargo, its operations will be 
unprofitable.  In recent low-level, operational 
discussions with Naif personnel, Mission staff and, we 
understand, MIF personnel, have been asked to comment 
on various proposals to work around the cargo 
restriction, but our response has been consistent: 
current permission exists for passengers and their 
personal effects only; any change to that status would 
need to be decided by the UNSC.
