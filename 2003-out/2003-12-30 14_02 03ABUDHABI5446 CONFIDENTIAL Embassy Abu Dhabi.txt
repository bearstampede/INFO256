SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO 
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY 
 
REF: STATE 349283 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE WAHBA, FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
¶1. (C) Ambassador delivered reftel talking points to MFA 
Assistant Undersecretary for Political Affairs Ambassador 
Abdullah Rashid Al Noaimi on December 30. 
 
¶2. (C) Al Noaimi stated that the UAE understands the 
importance of supporting the P.A., and the UAE government 
is doing its best to assist bilaterally through 
humanitarian projects run by the Red Crescent, as well as 
by making monthly monetary transfers to an established Arab 
League program.  He reiterated what "de facto" Foreign 
Minister Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayed told the Ambassador a few 
weeks ago, that the UAE did not intend to increase its 
pledge, but would make sure its contributions are 
transferred in a timely fashion.  He expressed confusion 
over the reason why the P.A. is under such financial 
pressure now, and speculated it is due to some or many of 
the Arab League countries not living up to or being very 
much behind on their pledges. 
 
¶3. (C) At the Ambassador's request, Al Noaimi has agreed to 
ensure that the UAE is current on its monthly transfers to 
the Palestinians.
