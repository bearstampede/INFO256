Â¶1.  (C) The Ambassador urged President Portillo on March 18 
to join the Central American Summit Statement on Iraq or to 
issue a unilateral statement along the same lines.  As 
Portillo is not attending the Summit in Roatan, Honduras, he 
told the Ambassador he would instruct Vice Minister Aguilera 
(who is representing Portillo there) to support the 
declaration and said he would issue a unilateral statement 
consistent with the statement issued at the Summit.
