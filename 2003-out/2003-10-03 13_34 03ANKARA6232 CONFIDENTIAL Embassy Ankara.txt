SUBJECT: TGS REQUESTS HLDG PROPOSAL

(U)  Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reasons:  1.5 (b) and 
(d). 
 
 
¶1. (U)  This is an action request.  See para 3. 
 
 
¶2. (C)  During his initial meeting with TGS Deputy Chief 
General Mehmet Ilker Basbug on October 2 (septel), the 
Ambassador informed the general that the US response to the 
Turkish proposed dates of November 17-19 for the next High 
Level Defense Group (HLDG) meeting was complicated by the 
imminent departure from government service of ASD Crouch who 
would normally chair the US side at the meeting.  SECDEF had 
reviewed the options and had chosen DASD Mira Ricardel to 
serve as acting ASD until the lengthy process of confirming a 
permanent successor could be completed.  As Basbug had 
earlier extolled the value of the HLDG and the need to use it 
to improve Turkey-US mil-mil relations, the Ambassador 
encouraged the general to consider going forward with the 
meeting in November; the alternative (of waiting for a 
permanent successor) would likely require waiting until at 
least sometime in the spring next year.  Basbug asked for a 
formal response to the Turkish dates which he could consider. 
 
 
¶3. (C)  Action request:  Although Basbug, who heads the 
Turkish side at the HLDG, did not agree on the spot, neither 
did he reject the idea of holding the meeting with an acting 
ASD out of hand.  We therefore recommend that Dr. Crouch 
write a letter proposing then-A/ASD Ricardel and Basbug 
convene the HLDG sometime during the week of November 17-22, 
as TGS proposed.  Simultaneously, Dr. Crouch might call 
Basbug to express his regrets at missing the HLDG, and to 
encourage Basbug's acceptance.
