SUBJECT:  A/S HARTY DISCUSSES VISAS, HOMELAND SECURITY AND 
CHILD ABDUCTION, WITH UAE OFFICIALS 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  DURING HER VISIT TO THE UAE, ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY FOR CONSULAR AFFAIRS MAURA HARTY ENGAGED A VARIETY 
 
SIPDIS 
OF UNITED ARAB EMIRATES OFFICIALS, MET WITH MISSION STAFF, AND 
CONDUCTED AN INTERVIEW WITH THE ABU DHABI NEWSPAPER OF RECORD 
AL ITTIHAD. IN A MEETING WITH SENIOR UAE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS (MFA) OFFICIALS, A/S HARTY EFFECTIVELY RESPONDED TO A 
RANGE OF VISA AND HOMELAND SECURITY CONCERNS AND REITERATED 
U.S. COMMITMENT TO A STRONG BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 
UAE.  WHILE EMPHASIZING THE PRIMACY OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND 
BORDER DEFENSE IN USG POLICY, A/S HARTY REASSURED HER 
INTERLOCUTORS THAT U.S. IS ALSO COMMITTED TO SECURE AND OPEN 
BORDERS AND AN EFFICIENT VISA ADJUDICATION PROCESS. 
 
¶2. (SBU) DURING HER VISIT, A/S HARTY MET WITH CONSULAR STAFF 
IN DUBAI AND ABU DHABI AND DISCUSSED NEW CONSULAR PROCESSING 
REQUIREMENTS, THE MOVE TO A NEW EMBASSY COMPOUND IN ABU DHABI, 
AND THE PROSPECT OF DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY (DHS) 
OFFICIALS BEING POSTED TO THE MISSION.  A/S HARTY ALSO TOOK 
TIME TO MENTOR THE MISSION'S JOB DURING AN HOUR-AND-A-HALF 
SOCIAL EVENT IN DUBAI. END SUMMARY.

A/S HARTY DISCUSSES VISAS AND HOMELAND SECURITY 
WITH SENIOR UAEG OFFICIALS

¶3. (SBU) A/S HARTY AND AMBASSADOR MET OCTOBER 19, 2003 WITH 
SAIF SAEED SAAD AL SUWAIDI, MFA UNDERSECRETARY, ABDULLAH 
RASHED AL NUAIMI, ASSISTANT UNDERSECRETARY FOR POLITICAL 
AFFAIRS, AHMED MUQARRAB, HEAD OF EUROPEAN AND AMERICAS DESK, 
AND AMBASSADOR ABDUL RAHIM ABDUL JALIL, DIRECTOR OF CONSULAR 
AFFAIRS.  DCM, CA SPECIAL ASSISTANT SIMKIN, AND CONSULAR 
CHIEF ACCOMPANIED THE A/S. 
 
¶4. (SBU) UNDERSECRETARY AL SUWAIDI OPENED THE MEETING BY 
RAISING LONG STANDING UAE CONCERNS WITH U.S. VISAS AND THEIR 
IMPACT ON TRAVELERS SUCH AS BUSINESSMEN, STUDENTS AND MEDICAL 
PATIENTS.  AMBASSADOR ABDUL JALIL THEN LISTED THE PROBLEMS THE 
UAEG HAS EXPERIENCED WITH OBTAINING U.S. VISAS, INCLUDING A 
TWO-MONTH WAIT FOR CITIZENS AND OFFICIALS VISITING THE USA. 
FOR ADDED EMPHASIS, AMBASSADOR ABDUL JALIL POINTED TO THE CASE 
OF THE UAE DESK OFFICER FOR THE AMERICAS, WHO WAS INVITED BY 
THE U.S. EMBASSY TO ATTEND A CONFERENCE BUT DID NOT GET HIS 
VISA IN TIME.  THIS PROBLEM IS NOT LIMITED TO STUDENTS OR 
OFFICIALS BUT ALSO UAE MEDICAL PATIENTS, WHO SHOULD BE GIVEN 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATION AS THEY ARE ALREADY CHECKED BY THE 
UAEG'S SECURITY SERVICES BEFORE THEY GO TO THE USA FOR 
GOVERNMENT-FUNDED TREATMENT.  IN THIS REGARD, THE USA HAS THE 
RIGHT TO CHECK VISA APPLICANTS BUT SHOULD NOT DELAY EVERYONE. 
ABDUL JALIL COMMENTED THAT U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY PRACTICES 
EVEN AFFECT TOP UAEG OFFICIALS, CITING THE CASE OF THE UAE 
AMBASSADOR TO THE USA, WHO RECENTLY WAS FORCED TO REMOVE HIS 
SHOES AT A U.S. POE.  FINALLY, AMBASSADOR ABDUL JALIL 
COMPLAINED THAT THE UAE EMBASSY IN D.C. IS FREQUENTLY NOT 
NOTIFIED WHEN UAE CITIZENS ARE DETAINED. 
 
¶5. (SBU) IN RESPONSE, A/S HARTY THANKED BOTH UNDERSECRETARY AL 
SUWAIDI AND AMBASSADOR ABDUL JALIL FOR THEIR CANDOR AND STATED 
THAT THE USG AND THE UAE HAVE A CLOSE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. 
EXPLAINING THE IMPACT OF SEPTEMBER 11 IN THE U.S., SHE NOTED 
THAT SHE WAS IN HER OFFICE ON 9/11 AND WATCHED THE PENTAGON 
BURN FOR DAYS, THE FIRES OF WHICH STILL BURN FOR MANY 
AMERICANS.  ON THE UAE AMBASSADOR TO THE USA, A/S HARTY SAID 
THAT SHE ALSO MUST TAKE OFF HER SHOES WHEN ASKED AT THE U.S. 
POE. A/S HARTY AGREED THAT THE USG HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO 
FACILITATE LEGITIMATE TRAVELERS AND NOTED SECRETARY POWELL'S 
COMMITMENT TO "SECURE BORDERS, OPEN BORDERS." 
 
¶6. (SBU) A/S HARTY FURTHER STATED THAT THE USG IS DOING MUCH 
BETTER THIS YEAR THAN LAST YEAR IN MAKING THE SYSTEM MORE 
EFFICIENT. THIS YEAR ALONE, 6.8 MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE 
WORLD APPLIED FOR VISAS - ONLY TWO PERCENT OF WHOM REQUIRED 
SPECIAL CLEARANCE PROCEDURES.  EIGHTY PERCENT OF THOSE ARE 
PROCESSED IN 10 TO 14 DAYS.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE USG MUST 
ASK ITS FRIENDS TO ALSO CHANGE THEIR PROCEDURES IN ORDER 
TO MEET THE POST 9/11 REQUIREMENTS.  HOWEVER, THE USG IS NOT 
GOING TO STOP ITS EFFORTS IN MAKING THE VISA PROCESS BETTER 
AND BETTER. 
 
¶7. (SBU) UNDERSECRETARY AL SUWAIDI REMARKED THAT MEDICAL 
PATIENTS ARE INCREASINGLY GOING TO GERMANY AND STUDENTS ARE 
OPTING FOR AUSTRALIA RATHER THAN THE U.S.  AT THE SAME TIME, 
AMBASSADOR ABDUL JALIL NOTED THE PROBLEMS UAE CITIZENS 
C O R R E C T E D COPY--(SYNTAX PARA 7,8,10) 
ENCOUNTER WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY ENTRY EXIT REGISTRATION 
SYSTEM (NSEERS).  IN RESPONSE, A/S HARTY STATED THAT WE ALL 
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF 
HOMELAND SECURITY (DHS).  REGARDING THE ISSUE OF AIRPORT EXIT 
REGISTRATION, SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THE NEED TO GIVE CLEAR, EASY 
DIRECTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLY.  IN THIS REGARD, SECRETARY POWELL 
ROUTINELY COMMUNICATES WITH SECRETARY RIDGE. 
 
¶8. (SBU) AMBASSADOR ABDUL JALIL STATED THAT THERE ARE 
DIFFERENT NSEERS PROCEDURES AT DIFFERENT AIRPORTS IN THE USA. 
A/S HARTY STATED THAT THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN AN OLD 
BUREAUCRACY IS A NEW BUREAUCRACY.  SHE STATED THAT WE ARE 
EDUCATING OURSELVES AND ARE ASKING FOR UNDERSTANDING FROM OUR 
FOREIGN PARTNERS.  AMBASSADOR WAHBA STATED THAT ARRIVAL AT 
U.S. POES IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DHS. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
PROBLEMS FOR UAE NATIONALS IN THE U.S. 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) AMBASSADOR ABDUL JALIL NOTED THAT THE USG SHOULD 
REALIZE THAT THE UAEG WANTS TO COOPERATE. HOWEVER, THERE HAVE 
BEEN CASES IN THE USA OF UAE NATIONALS BEING DETAINED IN 
DENVER, SPECIFICALLY, FOR NOT CARRYING THEIR UAE PASSPORTS. 
IN PARTICULAR, ONE UAE NATIONAL WAS DETAINED FOR THREE DAYS 
FOR NOT CARRYING HIS PASSPORT.  NOTING THAT CARRYING A 
PASSPORT WAS NOT A LEGAL REQUIREMENT IN THE U.S., A/S HARTY 
COMMENTED THAT UAE STUDENTS SHOULD PROBABLY MAKE A COPY OF 
THEIR PASSPORTS AND CARRY IT AT ALL TIMES. THAT ASIDE, THE USG 
HAS AN IMMEDIATE OBLIGATION TO INFORM FOREIGN MISSIONS WHEN 
ONE OF THEIR NATIONALS ARE ARRESTED OR DETAINED.  AMBASSADOR 
WAHBA NOTED THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PERSONAL STORIES, BUT THAT 
IF THE UAEG SEES A PATTERN, IT SHOULD INFORM THE U.S. EMBASSY, 
WHICH HAS ALREADY HELPED SEVERAL UAE STUDENTS WITH NSEERS 
PROBLEMS. 
 
¶10. (SBU) UNDERSECRETARY AL SUWAIDI STATED THAT THEY WOULD 
PREPARE A LIST OF CASES THAT NEED HELP.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT 
AMCITS DO NOT PAY FOR UAE VISAS AND DO NOT NEED A UAE VISA TO 
ENTER THE UAE. HOWEVER, THE USG MAKES UAE NATIONALS PAY USD 
100, POSSIBLY INCREASING TO USD 110 FOR A VISA TO THE USA. 
A/S HARTY REPLIED THAT MACHINE READABLE VISA FEES HAVE NOT 
BEEN RAISED YET, BUT THAT NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF CA 
OPERATIONS ARE FEE FUNDED.  CONGRESS MANDATED THE FEE INCREASE 
LAST TIME.  AMBASSADOR ABDUL JALIL STATED THAT THE UAEG COULD 
CHARGE A FEE TOO.  A/S HARTY REPLIED THIS WOULD BE THE 
PREROGATIVE OF THE UAEG, BUT NOTED THAT THE COST AND 
COMPLICATION OF FEE COLLECTION MIGHT NOT MAKE IT WORTHWHILE.

UAE PASSPORTS

¶11. (SBU) UNDERSECRETARY SUWAIDI THEN RAISED THE ISSUE OF 
CHANGES TO PLACE OF BIRTH IN UAE NATIONAL PASSPORTS.  A/S 
HARTY STATED THAT THIS CAUSES THE USG GREAT CONCERN. 
AMBASSADOR ALBUL JALIL REPLIED THAT THE UAEG HAS STOPPED THE 
INFREQUENT PRACTICE OF CHANGING THE PLACE OF BIRTH AND DATE OF 
BIRTH IN UAE PASSPORTS. 
 
--------------------------- 
CHILD ABDUCTION AND THE UAE 
--------------------------- 
 
¶12. (SBU) A/S HARTY DISCUSSED THE U.S. INITIATIVE TO CONCLUDE 
AGREEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENTS TO REDRESS THE PROBLEMS OF 
INTERNATIONAL PARENTAL CHILD ABDUCTION.  SHE NOTED THAT THE 
ISSUE WAS THE HARDEST TO CRACK IN SAUDI ARABIA.  HOWEVER, 
SINCE JANUARY OF 2003, TEN ABDUCTED AMCIT CHILDREN HAVE BEEN 
RETURNED TO THE USA FROM SAUDI ARABIA.  MEMORANDUMS OF 
UNDERSTANDING (MOU) WILL ALSO BE SIGNED WITH EGYPT AND 
LEBANON.  A DRAFT MOU IS UNDER CONSIDERATION IN JORDAN.  IN 
THE UAE, SHE NOTED THAT THERE ARE SIX CASES INVOLVING EIGHT 
AMCIT CHILDREN.  HOWEVER, SHE NOTED THAT THERE ARE NO UAE 
NATIONALS INVOLVED IN THREE OF THESE CASES AND THAT IT SHOULD 
BE EASY TO RETURN THE CHILDREN.  THE INTENTION OF THE MOU IS 
TO HAVE A MORE UNIFORM WAY OF APPROACHING THE ISSUE OF 
INTERNATIONAL PARENTAL CHILD ABDUCTION.  SHE SAID THAT THE 
EMBASSY WOULD SOON PRESENT A DRAFT AGREEMENT TO THE MFA. 
UNDERSECRETARY AL SUWAIDI INDICATED THE UAEG WILLINGNESS TO 
ENGAGE.  AT A LUNCH HOSTED BY THE AMBASSADOR, CONSULAR AFFAIRS 
DIRECTOR ABDUL JALIL TOLD A/S HARTY THAT THE CASES NOT 
INVOLVING UAE NATIONALS COULD BE RESOLVED IMMEDIATELY.
