SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. USAID/DAA/DCHA BILL GARVELINK AND D/FFP LAUREN LANDIS 
VISITED FAO ROME HEADQUARTERS ON JANUARY 24 TO REVIEW FAO'S 
SIZABLE OIL-FOR-FOOD (OFF)-FINANCED OPERATIONS IN IRAQ - AND 
ITS CAPABILITY TO DEVELOP AN AGRICULTURE-RELATED HUMANITARIAN 
RESPONSE MECHANISM FOR IRAQ IN THE EVENT OF OUTBREAK OF 
CONFLICT.  FAO STRESSED THAT ANY SUCCESSFUL POST-CONFLICT 
HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION MUST BE FOCUSED ON URGENT REVIVAL 
OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR.  FAO CURRENTLY HAS A TOTAL OF 72 
INTERNATIONAL AND 600 NATIONAL STAFF WORKING WITHIN IRAQ. 
PARTICULARLY IN THE THREE NORTHERN GOVERNORATES, WHERE FAO 
SPENDS SOME U.S. DOLLARS 70 MILLION/ANNUM AND IS DIRECTLY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REGION'S AGRICULTURE 
PROGRAM, IT IS CLEAR THAT FAO WILL BE A KEY PLAYER IN 
AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION.  IN US 
MISSION'S VIEW, IT IS URGENT THAT FAO CONTINUE TO BE STRONGLY 
FACTORED INTO THE IRAQ HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE OPERATIONAL 
DIALOGUE.  END SUMMARY.
