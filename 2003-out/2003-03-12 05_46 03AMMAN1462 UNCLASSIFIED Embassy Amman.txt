SUBJECT: RELO AMMAN NOMINEES FOR TESOL 2003 CONVENTION 
IN BALTIMORE, MARYLAND, MARCH 24-29, 2003 
 
REF: SECSTATE 
 
¶1.   Amman-based Regional English Language Office 
     (RELO) would like to nominate the following nominees: 
     Ms. Shireen Bawab from East Jerusalem, Mr. Abdul Bari 
     Muhajer from Aleppo, and Ms. Samia Abou Hamad from 
     Beirut to attend the TESOL 2003 convention in 
     Baltimore, Maryland, March 24-30, 2003. 
 
¶2.   MS. SHIREEN BAWAB - EAST JERUSALEM. Ms. Bawab is 
     one of the leading English as a Second Language (ESL) 
     professional in East Jerusalem. Because of the unique 
     situation of schools in East Jerusalem, Ms. Bawab works 
     closely with Arab sector of Israeli Ministry of 
     Education and the PA Ministry of Education. The Public 
     Affairs sections of both Tel Aviv and Jerusalem support 
     her nomination.  Ms. Bawab has extensive knowledge and 
     experience in teacher preparation (pre-service) and 
     teacher development (in-service) and teacher mentoring 
     at David Yellin College of Education and the Hebrew 
     University.  In addition, she has participated in 
     research projects in English language teaching 
     innovation, assessment and evaluation and the use of 
     new technologies at Bethlehem University.  In addition 
     to her 20 years of ESL experience, she has also taught 
     history and music and coordinated special events at the 
     College des Freres in East Jerusalem. 
 
¶3.   MR. ABDUL BRAI MUHAMMAD MUHAJER MEEN - SYRIA. Mr. 
     Muhajer is a senior inspector in the Directorate of 
     Education, Ministry of Education, Aleppo, Syria to 
     attend the TESOL 2003. He has been instrumental in 
     facilitating the work of the RELO in the training of 
     secondary English teachers in the Aleppo Directorate. 
     With nearly 30 years of experience in EFL he has taught 
     in the classroom, supervised and evaluated teachers, 
     and is currently responsible for the day to day 
     management of over 300 teachers in his district.  In 
     this key position he is responsible for carrying out 
     the national curriculum, making sure that his teacher 
     follow the prescribed methodology, and upgrading the 
     skills of his teachers. The amount of training 
     available to him in Syria has been minimal.  He does 
     attend the national conferences and has participated in 
     training sessions organized by both the British Council 
     and the American language center, but he has relied on 
     his own initiative and resources to carry out his 
     responsibilities.  These efforts have earned the 
     respect and admiration of the teachers, university 
     professor, and ministry officials. Attending TESOL will 
     enable him to expand his network of resources, deepen 
     his own understanding of theory and methodology and 
     gain first hand knowledge of life in the United States. 
     The multiplier effect of his trip will be immediate and 
     far-reaching.  He is an ideal candidate for this 
     program. 
 
¶4.   MS. SAMYA ABOU HAMAD - LEBANON. Ms. Abou Hamad is 
     the Head of the English Department of the Educational 
     Center of Research and Development, Ministry of 
     Education, Lebanon to attend TESOL 2003. Ms. Abou Hamad

               (teacher training institutions) in Lebanon.

     iii. Coordinator of English Language Methodology books 
          for students' teachers at the normal schools in 
          Lebanon.

     attendance of TESOL will be a tremendous step in 
     professional development.
