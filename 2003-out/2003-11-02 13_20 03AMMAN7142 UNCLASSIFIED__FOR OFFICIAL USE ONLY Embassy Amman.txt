SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON CONSOLIDATED UNRWA RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 303844 
 
(SBU) Refcoord delivered ref demarche to GOJ Department of 
Palestinian Affairs Director General Abdulkarim Abulhaija on 
October 30, leaving the draft resolution as a nonpaper.  (The 
GOJ, through the Department of Palestinian Affairs, plays an 
active leadership role among UNRWA host governments and in 
Arab League meetings on refugee issues.)  Refcoord emphasized 
that a consolidated UNRWA resolution would help turn the 
international community's attention away from difficult 
political issues back to UNRWA's core humanitarian mandate, 
thereby protecting donors' ability to continue strong 
financial support for the agency.  Noting that the GOJ shares 
U.S. concerns about depoliticizing UNRWA issues, Abulhaija 
promised to review the resolution and encourage the Jordanian 
mission in New York to cooperate with the U.S. mission on the 
draft resolution.
