OPEN SKIES 
---------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  ACCORDING TO TRANSPORT MINISTRY DIRECTOR FOR 
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS ALDO SANSONE, GOI OFFICIALS ARE 
RELIEVED THAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WAS GRANTED A MANDATE 
TO NEGOTIATE A U.S./EU OPEN SKIES AGREEMENT.  HE BELIEVES 
THAT THE EC NO LONGER HAS THE RIGHT TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION 
AGAINST MEMBER STATES WITH OPEN SKIES BILATERAL AGREEMENTS, 
NOR DOES IT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ASK THE MEMBER STATES TO 
DENOUNCE SUCH TREATIES.  WHILE OPEN SKIES WILL BE DISCUSSED 
AT THE JUNE 25 U.S./EU SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON, D.C., SANSONE 
FORESEES THE NEGOTIATIONS COMMENCING IN SEPTEMBER, AND 
EXPECTS TO BE PERSONALLY A MEMBER OF THE NEGOTIATING TEAM. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  SANSONE THOUGH THAT THESE NEGOTIATIONS WILL NOT BE 
CONCLUDED PAINLESSLY OR QUICKLY, ESPECIALLY GIVEN DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN U.S. AND EU LEGAL FRAMEWORKS.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE 
CONTINUED, THERE WILL BE A CLASH BETWEEN THE EU'S COMPETITION 
LAW AND THE U.S. SHERMAN ACT; THE QUESTION OF TRAFFIC RIGHTS 
    IS ALSO PROBLEMATIC.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE EMPHASIZED THAT 
BOTH THE U.S. AND THE EU APPEAR TO HAVE THE DESIRE AND 
SUPPORT TO SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDE AN U.S./EU OPEN SKIES 
AGREEMENT. 
 
CONTAINER SECURITY INITIATIVE (CSI) 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  ON MONDAY, JUNE 16, GENOA BECAME THE FIRST FULLY 
OPERATIONAL ITALIAN CSI PORT AND LA SPEZIA BECAME FULLY 
OPERATIONAL ON MONDAY, JUNE 23.  AFTER "PHASE ONE" HAS BEEN 
OPERATIONAL FOR FOUR TO SIX MONTHS, U.S. CUSTOMS WILL WORK 
WITH GOI OFFICIALS TO EXPAND CSI TO THREE ADDITIONAL ITALIAN 
PORTS - LIVORNO, GIOIA TAURO AND NAPLES.  WHILE GOI CUSTOMS 
AND POLICE OFFICIALS STRONGLY SUPPORT CSI, THEY ARE SENSITIVE 
TO ITALIAN PRESS REPORTING THAT USG OFFICIALS ARE CARRYING 
OUT CONTROLS, WHICH IS NOT THE CASE.  USG AND GOI OFFICIALS 
ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO CORRECT AND AVOID MISREPRESENTATION 
IN THE ITALIAN PRESS. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  GOI OFFICIALS ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE 
PRESENTATION OF A DRAFT AMENDMENT TO THE U.S./EU CUSTOMS 
MUTUAL ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT (CMAA) AT THE JUNE 25 U.S./EU 
SUMMIT.  IF APPROVED, BOTH GOI AND U.S. CUSTOMS OFFICIALS 
BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD CANCEL IMPENDING INFRINGEMENT 
PROCEEDINGS AGAINST MEMBER STATES WITH BILATERAL CSI 
AGREEMENTS WITH THE U.S. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  COMMENT.  HEADING INTO THE JUNE 25 U.S./EU SUMMIT 
AND ITS EU PRESIDENCY IN JULY, THE GOI APPEARS TO SUPPORT 
EUROPEAN COMMISSION EFFORTS TO CONCLUDE U.S./EU AGREEMENTS ON 
    BOTH OPEN SKIES AND CSI.  THE GOI IS ALSO COMMITTED TO A 
SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM MEMBER STATE TO U.S./EU AGREEMENTS IN 
BOTH CASES.  END COMMENT.
