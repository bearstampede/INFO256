REF: KUWAIT 1195 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbancic for reasons 1.5 (A), (B) and (D) 
 
¶1. (S/NF)  Post has investigated rumors of an explosion and 
fire at the Rawdatain oil field in northern Kuwait, and found 
them to be untrue.  KPC and U.S. military sources confirm 
that an apparent Iraqi missile did recently land in an 
unpopulated area south of the Rawdatain and west of the 
Sabriya fields, but the impact had no effect on oil 
facilities or operations. 
 
¶2. (C) Post is also investigating unconfirmed reports of an 
unscheduled shutdown of Gathering Center 20 in the Wafra 
field (shared with Saudi Arabia).  There is nothing to 
suggest at this point that the shutdown is serious or long 
lasting. 
 
¶3. (C) Following is the unedited data set provided by the 
Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) production on April 2,
