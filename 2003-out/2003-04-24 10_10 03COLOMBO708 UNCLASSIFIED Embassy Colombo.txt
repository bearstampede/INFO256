POSSIBLE ROCCA VISIT 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  (U) Devinda Subasinghe called Ambassador last night 
mentioning a possible visit of A/S Rocca on May 11-12. 
We would welcome her visit at that time.  She should be 
aware however, that Vesak, a major holiday, occurs during 
that week (May 14 and 15), and many officials may be 
unavailable for meetings.  (ECON) 
 
GSL INQUIRY ON TEA SALES TO IRAQ 
-------------------------------- 
¶2.  (U) The Minister of Commerce called the Ambassador 
this morning asking for clarification about the rules 
governing sales to Iraq under the Oil for Food Program 
(or whatever the new incarnation of that program is 
called).  We understand these kinds of issues are 
currently under discussion at the UN.  Can you check with 
IO or AID or the relevant office to help us answer two 
questions: 1. Will tea be one of the commodity goods 
approved for sale to Iraq under "Oil for Food"? 2. How 
can the Sri Lankan government go about selling its tea to 
Iraq under this program?  We'd like to be responsive and 
get back to GSL ASAP. (ECON)
