E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV IT
SUBJECT: ITALY:  NO FUTURE COURT APPEARANCES FOR PRIME 
MINISTER BERLUSCONI 
 
REF: A. ROME 2529 
     ¶B. ROME 2284 
 
    (U)  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; NOT FOR INTERNET 
DISTRIBUTION. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  LEGISLATION TO SUSPEND TRIALS AGAINST 
ITALY'S FIVE HIGHEST OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THE PRIME MINISTER, 
DURING THEIR TERMS OF OFFICE, IS VIRTUALLY LAW.  WE PREDICT A 
TRIAL-FREE ITALIAN EU PRESIDENCY AND REMAINING TENURE FOR 
PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U)  THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES ON JUNE 18 PASSED 
LEGISLATION SUSPENDING TRIALS AGAINST ITALY'S FIVE HIGHEST 
INSTITUTIONAL FIGURES (PRESIDENTS OF THE REPUBLIC, SENATE, 
CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, AND CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, AND THE PRIME 
MINISTER) DURING THEIR TERMS IN OFFICE BY A VOTE OF 302 IN 
FAVOR, 17 AGAINST, WITH 13 ABSTENTIONS.  (MOST OF THE 
OPPOSITION WALKED OUT OF THE CHAMBER.)  CENTER-LEFT DAISY 
PARTY DEPUTY ANTONIO MACCANICO, WHO FIRST INTRODUCED 
LEGISLATION TO SHIELD THE FIVE OFFICIALS, AND GREENS DEPUTY 
MARCO BOATO, WHOSE DRAFT TO EXPAND PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY WAS 
USED BY THE MAJORITY AS THE BASIS FOR THE LEGISLATION, JOINED 
THE CENTRIST UNION OF DEMOCRATS FOR EUROPE (UDEUR) AND 
ITALIAN DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS (SDI) IN ABSTAINING.  THE 
SENATE PASSED THE SAME LEGISLATION ON JUNE 5 (REF A). 
 
¶3.  (U)  THE LEGISLATION MUST STILL BE SIGNED BY PRESIDENT OF 
THE REPUBLIC CIAMPI AND PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL GAZETTE 
BEFORE TAKING EFFECT.  UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, CIAMPI HAS 30 
DAYS TO SIGN THE LEGISLATION OR RETURN IT TO PARLIAMENT, BUT 
HE IS EXPECTED TO SIGN IT WITHIN THE WEEK.  IT WOULD NORMALLY 
BE PUBLISHED THE FOLLOWING DAY; A LAW TAKES EFFECT THE DAY 
AFTER PUBLICATION.  THUS, ALL OBSERVERS PREDICT THAT THE 
    LEGISLATION WILL BE LAW WELL BEFORE THE END OF JUNE, AND 
CERTAINLY IN TIME FOR ITALY TO ASSUME THE EU PRESIDENCY. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE PRIME MINISTER WILL NOW 
PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT SCHEDULED HEARING FOR HIS JUDICIAL 
BRIBERY TRIAL (THE "SME" CASE, REF B AND PREVIOUS) ON JUNE 
¶25.  HE COULD DO SO FOR PUBLIC RELATIONS OR OTHER REASONS, 
BUT WOULD APPEAR NOT TO BE REQUIRED TO DO SO UNDER THE NEW 
LAW.  HIS LAWYERS ARE EXPECTED TO REQUEST A SUSPENSION OF 
PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE NEW LAW AT THAT SESSION. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) MOST OBSERVERS ARE ALSO PREDICTING, HOWEVER, THAT 
EITHER THE MILAN COURT CONSIDERING THE SME CASE OR THE 
MAGISTRATE PROSECUTING IT WILL REQUEST A CONSTITUTIONAL 
REVIEW OF THE LEGISLATION.  OPPOSITION PROTESTERS WITHIN AND 
OUT OF PARLIAMENT HAVE VOCIFEROUSLY ASSERTED THAT THE LAW IS 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  SUCH ACTION IS VERY LIKELY, ALBEIT NOT 
GUARANTEED, TO HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS THE LEGISLATION ITSELF 
-- PUSHING FURTHER ACTION ON THE BERLUSCONI CASE DOWN THE 
ROAD INDEFINITELY.  CENTRIST, BUSINESS-ORIENTED "IL SOLE 24 
ORE" WROTE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS USED "PARTICULAR 
CAUTION" WITH CASES CONCERNING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN 
PARLIAMENT (WE WOULD SAY THE GOVERNMENT) AND THE MAGISTRACY; 
AT LEAST ONE CASE SEEKING A DETERMINATION OF APPROPRIATE 
COMPETENCIES FOR EACH HAS BEEN PENDING BEFORE THE COURT FOR 
SOME TWO YEARS. 
 
¶6.  (U)  MEANWHILE, THE GOVERNING COALITION HAS ALSO 
INTRODUCED DRAFT LEGISLATION TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION TO 
PROVIDE BROADER PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY, MIRRORING LEGISLATION 
RECENTLY ENACTED BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT.  (THE IMMUNITY 
    WOULD APPLY TO BERLUSCONI, SENATE PRESIDENT PERA, AND CHAMBER 
PRESIDENT CASINI BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SIMULTANEOUS STATUS AS 
ELECTED PARLIAMENTARIANS; A PROVISION COULD ALSO BE MADE FOR 
THE PRESIDENTS OF THE REPUBLIC AND OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
COURT.)  THE LEGISLATION IS IN THE SENATE.  A CONSTITUTIONAL 
AMENDMENT REQUIRES TWO READINGS, SEPARATED BY 90 DAYS, IN 
EACH HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT.  DEPENDING ON THE VOTE COUNT, IT 
CAN ALSO REQUIRE A NATIONAL REFERENDUM.  IT IS THEREFORE 
POSSIBLE THAT BY THE TIME THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WERE TO 
REVIEW THE CURRENT LEGISLATION, THE PENDING LEGISLATION WOULD 
RENDER THE WHOLE DISCUSSION MOOT. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  WE PREDICT A TRIAL-FREE EU PRESIDENCY 
FOR PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI, AND ALMOST CERTAINLY A 
TRIAL-FREE REMAINDER OF HIS TERM IN OFFICE.
