Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) DCM, DATT, MILGP Commander, and PolMilOff met with 
Honduran Minister of Defense (MOD) Federico Breve on April 23 
and discussed, among other issues, the GOH's offer to 
provide Honduran troops for post-war humanitarian needs 
(demining or peacekeeping) in Iraq (refs A and B).  MOD Breve 
told EmbOffs that he had a number of operational questions 
before the GOH was ready to ask for congressional approval of 
such a deployment.  Post understands that the Honduran 
military liaison to CENTCOM, COL Carlos Andino Cobos, is 
working with CENTCOM to determine the most appropriate 
contribution of Honduran troops for post-war Iraq.  In 
addition, Post's MILGP Commander will work with CENTCOM to 
seek answers to MOD Breve's specific questions to facilitate 
the fulfillment of the Honduran troop offer.
