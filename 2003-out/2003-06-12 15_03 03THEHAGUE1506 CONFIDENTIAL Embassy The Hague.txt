     ¶C. THE HAGUE 1434 
 
Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE DANIEL RUSSEL FOR REASONS 1.5 (B AN 
D D). 
 
¶1. (C) AMBASSADOR MADE REF A DEMARCHE TO DUTCH MFA POLITICAL 
DIRECTOR HUGO SIBLESZ ON JUNE 12.  SIBLESZ SAID HE SAW NO GAP 
BETWEEN U.S. AND DUTCH VIEWS ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM, ONLY 
A DIFFERENCE OVER TACTICS.  THE DUTCH PREFERENCE FOR THE JUNE 
16 IAEA BOARD OF GOVERNORS' MEETING IS FOR SOME FORM OF 
CHAIRMAN'S CONCLUSIONS AS OPPOSED TO A RESOLUTION, WHICH 
"LEAVES NO OTHER EXIT THAN REFERENCE TO THE UNSC."  THE 
ELEMENTS OF THOSE CONCLUSIONS ARE LARGELY THE SAME (THAT IRAN 
HAS A NUMBER OF NONCOMPLIANCE PROBLEMS, THAT THERE ARE A 
RANGE OF QUESTIONS IRAN MUST ANSWER, THAT IRAN SHOULD SIGN UP 
TO AN ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL).  SIBLESZ NOTED THAT IRAN WOULD BE 
ON THE AGENDA FOR THE JUNE 16 EU FOREIGN MINISTERS' MEETING 
AND THAT THE NETHERLANDS SEEKS A STRONG MESSAGE OUT OF THAT 
EVENT.  GIVEN THE CONCERNS ABOUT IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM, THE 
NETHERLANDS BELIEVES THAT THE EU SHOULD DELAY ITS CURRENT 
NEGOTIATIONS ON A TRADE AND COOPERATION AGREEMENT (TCA) WITH 
IRAN. 
 
¶2. (C) ACTING POLCOUNS ALSO REVIEWED REF A WITH MFA ACTING 
NONPROLIFERATION DIRECTOR PETER POTMAN (PROTECT).  POTMAN 
SHARED A COPY OF A NONPAPER THAT THE IRANIAN AMBASSADOR TO 
THE NETHERLANDS HAD RECENTLY PRESENTED TO THE DUTCH MFA 
(CONVEYED TO NP/RA PER REF B) JUSTIFYING THE IRANIAN PROGRAM, 
AND STATING IRAN WOULD ACCEPT ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL IN EXCHANGE 
FOR GUARANTEES OF AN END TO "ALL PROPAGANDA ABOUT IRAN'S 
NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND RESTRICTIONS AGAINST IRAN'S FULL ACCESS 
TO NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY FOR PEACEFUL PURPOSES."  POTMAN SAID 
THE NETHERLANDS THOUGHT THE BOARD SHOULD UNITE BEHIND 
CHAIRMAN ELBARADEI'S REPORT, EXPRESS ITS CONCERN, CALL ON 
IRAN TO COOPERATE FULLY, AND FOR THE IAEA TO FURTHER 
INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE.
