SUBJECT:  UAEG DENIES BANKROLLING IRAQI SUNNI 
CLERIC AHMED AL-KUBAYSI 
 
REF:  ABU DHABI 2654 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Richard A. Albright, Charge 
d'Affaires, a.i., for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) UAE Information Minister Sheikh Abdullah Bin 
Zayed Al-Nahyan denied that his government was 
financing Iraqi Sunni cleric Ahmed Al-Kubaysi.  In 
an August 19 meeting with Charge and Polchief, 
Sheikh Abdullah said it was possible that some 
individuals in the UAE were giving money to Al- 
Kubaysi, but he doubted that those amounts totaled 
more than a "couple of hundreds of thousands of 
dollars."  The discussion about Al-Kubaysi came a 
day after the English-language daily Gulf News 
reprinted a Washington Post article about Al- 
Kubaysi allegedly providing an anti-American Shiite 
cleric in Iraq, Moqtada Sadr, with $50 million. 
 
¶3. (C) Aside from denying any UAEG financial involvement 
with Al-Kubaysi, Sheikh Abdullah said his government was 
prepared to speak with the Sunni cleric if his sermons are 
causing problems for Coalition efforts in Iraq.  As 
reported in reftel, Emirati leaders promoted Al-Kubaysi 
early on, hopeful that he would help curb Iranian influence 
and, conversely, serve as a unifying force for Iraqi Sunni 
and Shi'a.  Following his strident April 18 sermon at the 
Abu Hanifa Mosque in Baghdad, and our expressions of 
concern, the UAEG intervened to get Al-Kubaysi to moderate 
his message. 
 
¶4. (C) Charge said we would welcome UAEG 
intervention with Kubaysi.  In a separate 
conversation Polchief had August 20 on the same 
topic with Yousef Al-Otaiba, an assistant to UAE 
Armed Forces Chief of Staff Sheikh Mohammed Bin 
Zayed Al-Nahyan (MbZ), Al-Otaiba said he checked 
his sources and came up with the same answer. 
"There is absolutely no UAEG institution supporting 
Al-Kubaysi."  Al-Otaiba added that MbZ doubted that 
Sadr is as influential as portrayed in the 
Washington Post article (originally dated August 
17).
