¶1. (S/NF) During his March 20 meeting with MFA U/S Ziyal (ref 
c), Ambassador followed up his recent requests for the GOT to 
expel Iraqi intelligence officers (ref b) by urging the GOT 
to suspend Iraq's diplomatic presence in Turkey on a 
temporary basis and take steps to assure the prompt departure 
of the leading representatives of Saddam Hussein's government 
(ref a).  The Ambassador said that the USG specifically 
requests that the GOT declare the Iraqi ambassador and other 
suspected Iraqi intelligence officers still in Turkey persona 
non grata, and ensure that they promptly leave Turkey. 
 
 
¶2. (S/NF) Ziyal said the matter would require a political 
decision and agreed to refer it to the proper authorities. 
Ziyal went on to say that hypothetically speaking, if the GOT 
were to agree to shut down the Iraqi mission and expel Iraqi 
embassy staff, where would Turkey send them?  Ziyal said the 
Iraqis could not be expected to return to Iraq. The 
Ambassador responded that the real issue was for the GOT to 
take the necessary steps now to disrupt the activities of the 
Iraqi intelligence services who are threatening US personnel 
and facilities in Turkey.  The best way to disrupt these 
activities is to expel the high-level members of the Iraqi 
diplomatic mission and the intelligence officers, and to shut 
down temporarily the mission. 
 
 
¶3. (S/NF) Ziyal asked the Ambassador if the USG was making 
the same request to other countries.  The Ambassador replied 
yes.  Ziyal asked if we knew which countries could be 
expected to receive the expelled Iraqis.  The Ambassador said 
he did not know, but would refer the question to Washington.
