¶1. (C) On October 30, PolOff delivered reftel demarche on the 
consolidated UNRWA resolution to Pieter Ramaer, Head of the 
MFA's Political and Legal Affairs Division.  The Dutch 
support U.S. efforts to streamline the Fourth Committee 
resolution process, but believe the difficulties UNRWA faces 
in executing their programs makes streamlining this 
particular series of resolutions difficult.  According to 
Ramaer, the Arab Group needs this resolution process as an 
outlet for their frustration, and they will question why the 
U.S. is focusing efforts on resolutions, rather than on 
improving the situation on the ground.  He promised to 
discuss the proposed resolution with the Dutch delegation in 
New York, and said any future decision will be made within an 
EU framework.  Ramaer reiterated Dutch support in principle, 
but cautioned that the Arab Group may insist on keeping the 
resolutions on the agenda.
