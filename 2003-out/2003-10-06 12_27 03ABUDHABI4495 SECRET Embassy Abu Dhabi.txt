SUBJECT:  UAE: PSI STATEMENT OF INTERDICTION PRINCIPLES 
 
REF:  A. STATE 272470 
 ¶B. STATE 254587 
 ¶C. ABU DHABI 2988 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) Per Refs A and B, Polchief delivered the 
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) Statement of 
Principles on September 7 and followed up with MFA 
interlocutors September 28 and 30.  Polchief also made 
contact with other embassies that had received similar 
demarche instructions from their capitals.  The MFA's 
Americas, European, and Oceanian department told us PSI 
is undergoing inter-agency review and a formal opinion is 
unlikely before the October 9-10 London meeting.  We 
understand that the UK, Australian, and Dutch Embassies 
approached the MFA separately in support of PSI and 
received a similar response.  A team of British experts 
is due to visit the UAE in the coming months. 
 
¶2. (S) As reported in Ref C, U/S Bolton briefed MFA 
Minstate Hamdan bin Zayed on the PSI in a June 18 meeting 
in Abu Dhabi.  Hamdan told Bolton that the UAE is fully 
committed to cooperation with the U.S. with regard to 
Iran's nuclear threat.  He noted the UAE's deep concern 
about Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program, and 
stated that any weapons proliferation in Asia poses a 
"direct threat to the national security of the UAE."
