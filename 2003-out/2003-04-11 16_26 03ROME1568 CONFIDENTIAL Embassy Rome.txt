REF: A) STATE B) ROME 1168 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POL MINISTER COUNSELOR TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON: 1.5 (B)( 
D). 
 
¶1.  (U)  WE DELIVERED POINTS REF A TO APPROPRIATE GOI 
OFFICES.  RESPONSES FOLLOW BELOW. 
 
ESDP 
----- 
¶2.  (SBU) MFA BALKANS OFFICE DIRECTOR FERNANDO GENTILINI SAID 
THAT THE GOI CONCURS WITH THE USG VIEW THAT THE EU NEEDED TO 
MAKE A SUCCESS OF OPERATION CONCORDIA BEFORE FOCUSING ON A 
POSSIBLE EU-LED OPERATION TO REPLACE SFOR IN BOSNIA. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  CURRENT GOI MILITARY PARTICIPATION IN OPERATION 
CONCORDIA IS: 22 PERSONNEL ON THE GROUND IN MACEDONIA, 11 
STAFF MEMBERS IN BRUSSELS AND 5 SUPPORT STAFF IN NAPLES. 
GENTILINI SAID THAT THE GOI HAD NO PLANS TO ADJUST THESE 
FIGURES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. 
 
CROATIA AND SERBIA 
------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  GENTILINI WAS GRATEFUL FOR THE POINTS SUMMARIZING 
USG VIEWS ON CROATIAN AND SERBIAN INTEGRATION.  HE WAS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

PREPARING BRIEFING PAPERS FOR AN APRIL 11 TROIKA MEETING IN 
ZAGREB ON THE ZAGREB PROCESS/BALKAN INTEGRATION, AND SAID 
THAT THE POINTS WOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN 
PREPARING GOI POSITIONS. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  GENTILINI REITERATED THAT ONE OF THE PRIORITIES OF 
THE GOI EU PRESIDENCY BEGINNING JULY 1 IS TO RE-FOCUS EU 
ATTENTION ON THE LONG-TERM ACCESSION PROCESS FOR THE BALKANS. 
 STARTING WITH THE STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT 
(SAA), AND MOVING ON THROUGH FORMAL ACQUIS COMMUNAUTAIRE 
NEGOTIATIONS, THE GOI BELIEVES THAT THE ACCESSION PROCESS IS 
AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR ENCOURAGING ASPIRANT COUNTRIES TO 
REFORM ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  PART OF THAT PROCESS, CONTINUED GENTILINI, WILL BE 
THE REQUIREMENT FOR MORE "ROBUST" COOPERATION WITH THE ICTY 
AND RETURNS OF REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS.  HE SAID THAT 
THE GOI WOULD CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR PROGRESS IN 
THESE AND OTHER CONDITIONS HIGHLIGHTED IN REF A. AT THE APRIL 
14 GAERC AND THROUGHOUT THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY. 
 
BELARUS VISA BAN 
---------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  ACCORDING TO FABIO CRISTIANI, HEAD OF THE MFA'S 
OSCE OFFICE, THE GOI IS PLEASED THAT THE USG MODIFIED ITS 
POSITION ON RESCINDING THE VISA BAN AND WANTS TO WORK WITH 
THE EU ON COORDINATED STATEMENTS EXPRESSING CONCERN ABOUT THE 
HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN BELARUS.  HE SAID THAT SUCH AN EU 
STATEMENT WAS ALREADY BEING DRAFTED IN BRUSSELS IN 
PREPARATION FOR THE GAERC, AND CONFIRMED THAT THE GOI WOULD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

¶8.  (C) POST TOOK ADVANTAGE OF U/S BOLTON'S VISIT APRIL 9 TO 
REITERATE TO THE GOI THE IMPORTANCE OF CHECKING IRAN AND 
NORTH KOREA'S PURSUIT OF WMD.  HIS GOI INTERLOCUTORS 
UNDERLINED THAT ITALY VIEWS THIS ISSUE VERY SERIOUSLY, AND 
WILL USE ITS EU PRESIDENCY TO PUSH FOR CLOSER US/EU 
COOPERATION ON ADDRESSING WMD CHALLENGES.  THEY ALSO NOTED 
THE NEED FOR MORE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT OF RUSSIA (FOR IRAN AND 
NORTH KOREA) AND CHINA (FOR NORTH KOREA) IN THE PROCESS. 
 
¶9. (C)  WE ALSO PASSED REFTEL POINTS ON NK TO MFA DIRECTOR

US THE GOI REMAINS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THAT THE UPCOMING 
CANCUN WTO MINISTERIAL MEETING WILL BE SUCCESSFUL, BUT TETI 
PREDICTED THAT FORWARD MOVEMENT ON THE AGRICULTURAL PROPOSAL

MOVEMENT IS REQUIRED FOR SUCH A RESOLUTION.  TETI SAID THE

POSSIBLE SUBMISSION DATE FOR THE EU,S PROPOSAL.
