¶1. (C) On September 24 and 25, ASSK's personal physician 
again briefed diplomats on her post-surgery recovery.  Dr. 
Tin Myo Win said that ASSK was doing well and "nearly 
normal."  He removed her stitches on September 25 and said 
that she could be discharged "within one or two days."  He 
re-emphasized that she was well enough to receive "special 
guests," but that SPDC military intelligence (MI) officials 
had not notified him of any visits.  He added that ASSK was 
aware that Indonesian special envoy Alatas had visited 
Rangoon and would have welcomed an opportunity to see him. 
 
¶2. (C) Dr. Tin Myo Win said that he is concerned about ASSK's 
long-term care, especially over the next 1-2 months, and any 
possible complications resulting from her "major" operation. 
He said he had expressed these concerns to the authorities, 
and described them as cooperative, but added that he had no 
assurances on where she would be sent after her discharge. 
He said, however, that the authorities would allow him daily 
access to ASSK after her discharge, and that they would also 
permit one of his assistant physicians to reside with her on 
a full-time basis.  He concluded that ASSK is in "100 percent 
top spiritual and mental form," and had expressed gratitude 
for the concern and support of diplomatic missions. 
 
¶3. (C) The crowd of NLD supporters at the hospital dwindled 
to several dozen on September 24, but then reached well over 
150 on September 25.  According to sources, including ASSK's 
physician, MI threatened arrests if supporters repeated their 
September 23 demonstration, which included hand-written 
signs.  Authorities arrested a solo demonstrator at City Hall 
on September 24 for shouting out "Free ASSK now."
