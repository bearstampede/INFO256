SUBJECT: CAMBODIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SUPPORTS RELEASE OF 
AUNG SAN SUU KYI 
 
REF: STATE 146687 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR CHARLES A. RAY.  REASON: 1.5 (B) (D). 
 
¶1.  (C) DURING A JUNE 4 MEETING ON THE CAMBODIAN ELECTIONS 
AND COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION (SEPTEL), THE AMBASSADOR 
ASKED FOREIGN MINISTER HOR NAMHONG TO WEIGH IN WITH THE SPDC 
TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF AUNG SAN SUU KYI.  OBSERVING THAT 
THE DETENTION OF AUNG SAN SUU KYI ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE 
REPUTATION OF ASEAN AS A WHOLE, THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT 
CAMBODIA AS THE ASEAN CHAIR COULD PLAY A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN 
CONVINCING THE SPDC TO RELEASE HER. 
 
¶2.  (C) INDICATING THAT HE WAS AWARE OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
OUTRAGE AT THE DETENTION, HOR NAMHONG RESPONDED THAT HE HAD 
JUST GIVEN AN INTERVIEW TO NHK, THE JAPANESE TELEVISION 
NETWORK.  HE SAID THAT HE HAD RELATED TO NHK THAT ASEAN HAD 
BEEN PLEASED WITH THE DEVELOPMENTS IN BURMA OVER THE LAST 
COUPLE OF YEARS, INCLUDING AUNG SAN SUU KYI'S RELEASE FROM 
HOUSE ARREST, THE DIALOGUE WITH THE SPDC AND THE FREEDOM SHE 
HAD TO MOVE AROUND THE COUNTRY.  NOW, HE SAID, ASEAN WAS "NOT 
VERY HAPPY."  HOR NAMHONG SAID THAT HE COMMENTED THAT HE 
HOPED THE SITUATION WOULD SOON RETURN TO NORMAL.  THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER ADDED THAT ASEAN'S PRINCIPLE OF NON-INTERFERENCE IN 
THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF MEMBER COUNTRIES PREVENTED HIM FROM 
TAKING DIRECT ACTION WITH BURMA UNLESS INVITED.  HE NOTED TO 
THE AMBASSADOR ALSO THAT BURMA'S ACTIONS WOULD BE A TOPIC FOR 
DISCUSSION AT THE ARF/PMC MEETINGS. 
 
¶3.  (C) COMMENT.  WHILE NOT PERHAPS AS MUCH AS WE WANTED FROM 
HOR NAMHONG, HIS PUBLIC EXPRESSION OF UNHAPPINESS WITH THE 
SPDC'S ACTIONS IS PROBABLY THE MOST WE COULD HOPE FOR.  THE 
ARF WILL, OF COURSE, PROVIDE A FORUM FOR CONCERNED NATIONS TO 
EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS ON THE SPDC.
