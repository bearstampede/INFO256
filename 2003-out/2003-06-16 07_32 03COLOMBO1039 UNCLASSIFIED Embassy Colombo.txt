NOMINATING-OFFICER: Joe Novak 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Ms. Arulanandam is a young lecturer at the University 
of Jaffna that is expected to become a tenured 
professor in the not too distant future.  As such she 
can be expected to have an influence on Jaffna 
University students, many of whom are radical in their 
support for the LTTE, for a couple of decades.  It is 
clearly in the Mission's interest to have a University 
lecturer in Jaffna that not only speaks favorably about 
the US, but can also give first hand accounts of her 
experience with the USG, as well as be an influencing 
factor on the University students' respect for 
democracy.  The IVP grant will permit her to do just 
that.
