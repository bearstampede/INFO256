TAGS: PHUM PREL IR IT UNGA UNGA
SUBJECT: UNGA 3RD COMMITTEE IRAN RESOLUTION: NO ITALIAN 
CO-SPONSORSHIP, VOTE DECISION PENDING 
 
REF: A) STATE 316541 B)STATE 318063 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POL M/C TOM COUNTRYMAN, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (C) ITALY WILL NOT CO-SPONSOR CANADA'S 3RD COMMITTEE 
    RESOLUTION ON IRAN, DEPUTY POLDIR CLAUDIO BISOGNIERO TOLD POL 
M/C NOVEMBER 14.  BISOGNIERO'S RESPONSE CONFIRMED MFA HUMAN 
RIGHTS COORDINATOR ALESSANDRO FALLAVOLLITA'S LATE OCTOBER 
ASSESSMENT THAT EU MEMBER-STATES HAD REACHED CONSENSUS TO 
SUPPORT AN IRAN RESOLUTION IF ONE WAS TABLED, BUT NOT TO 
CO-SPONSOR ONE. 
 
¶2. (C) BISOGNIERO ALSO INDICATED THE ITALIAN MFA WAS UNHAPPY 
WITH THE LENGTH AND DEGREE OF DETAIL IN THE CANADIAN DRAFT; 
AS EU PRESIDENT, IT HAD PROVIDED CANADA WITH NUMEROUS 
PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE DRAFT AGREED BY FELLOW MEMBER-STATES. 
 ITALY WOULD WAIT UNTIL JUST PRIOR TO A VOTE ON THE 
RESOLUTION, PROBABLY THE DAY BEFORE, TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE 
DRAFT WAS SUFFICIENTLY IMPROVED TO MERIT ITS VOTE IN FAVOR. 
HUMAN RIGHTS DEPUTY OFFICE DIRECTOR CAMPANILE TOLD US 
NOVEMBER 17 THE EU'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CANADIAN 
DRAFT ALREADY HAD BEEN TRANSMITTED TO THE ITALIAN MISSION IN 
NY. 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT: THE ITALIANS SHARE OUR CONCERNS OVER IRAN'S 
POOR RECORD ON HUMAN RIGHTS BUT REMAIN WEDDED TO THE EU'S 
POLICY OF ENGAGEMENT.  FALLOVOLLITA HAS ARGUED TO US THAT THE 
EU'S HR DIALOGUE WAS BEGINNING TO PRODUCE RESULTS, CITING 
TEHRAN'S PROFESSED WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER TERMINATING THE 
USE OF JUVENILE EXECUTIONS AND  STRIKING THE RELIGION CLAUSE 
FROM ITS UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION LEGISLATION.  REFLECTING THE 
EU'S COMMITMENT TO THIS DIALOGUE, THE ITALIANS ARE TRYING TO 
STRIKE THE FINE BALANCE BETWEEN CRITICIZING CREDIBLY THE 
IRANIAN GOVERNMENT AND MAINTAINING INCENTIVES FOR IT TO 
CONTINUE THE DIALGUE WITH THE EU.  TO BE EFFECTIVE, ANY 
FURTHER DEMARCHES ON THIS RESOLUTION WOULD REQUIRE MORE 
    SPECIFIC REFERENCES TO PROBLEMATIC ASPECTS OF THE EU'S 
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS IN NY.
