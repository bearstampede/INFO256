AZIZ STATEMENTS

¶2. (U) EMBASSY SEES NOTHING NEW OR INNOVATIVE IN AZIZ'S 
STATEMENTS SO FAR.  HIS RECURRENT THEMES: 
-- "WE (IRAQIS) ARE COOPERATING WITH THE UNMOVIC AND IAEA 
INSPECTORS, WE ARE DOING OUR BEST." 
-- IRAQ'S MISSILES ARE "WITHIN THE RANGE LIMITS THAT WERE 
DECIDED BY THE UN.  OUR (IRAQ'S) MISSILES ARE NOT DANGEROUS. 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IRAQ'S MISSILES HAVE A VERY SHORT RANGE 
AND DO NOT HAVE A GUIDING SYSTEM.  THIS IS WHY THEY LAND 5 OR 
10 KILOMETERS FROM THE TARGET AND THEY ARE THEREFORE NOT VERY 
DANGEROUS." 
-- "ALL THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN PEACE AND IN JUSTICE, ALL THOSE 
WHO BELIEVE IN GOD, CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS, ARE AGAINST THIS 
AGGRESSION AND CONTINUE TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO PREVENT IT."

PRESIDENT FORMIGONI (REF B) FEB. 13 AND THE OTHER WITH FM 
FRATTINI (REFS A AND C) FEB. 14.  IN A PRESS CONFERENCE 
FOLLOWING HIS MEETING WITH FORMIGONI, AZIZ SAID:"IF WE GIVE 
THE INSPECTORS MORE TIME, THE TRUTH WILL BE EVIDENT, BECAUSE 
THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FIND WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, 
SINCE THEY DON'T EXIST.  THEIR (THE AMERICANS) REAL INTENT 
HAS A NAME: IT IS OIL AND DOMINATION." 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE AFTER HIS MEETING WITH AZIZ, 
FORMIGONI SAID: 
-- "THE INSPECTORS MUST BE ASKED TO GIVE CLEAR ANSWERS, BUT 
THEY MUST ALSO BE GIVEN TIME TO GET CLEAR ANSWERS." 
-- TAREQ AZIZ "DID NOT COME EMPTY-HANDED.  HE CAME WITH 
PROPOSALS AND HYPOTHESES, WHICH I CANNOT TALK ABOUT, FOR 
FAIRNESS' SAKE.  BUT I GOT THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION THAT THE 
SITUATION IS IN MOTION." 
-- FORMIGONI NOTED AN "AVAILABILITY ON THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT'S 
PART TO COOPERATE WITH THE UN INSPECTORS.  "I THINK GIVING 
THE INSPECTORS TIME TO WORK IS RIGHT AND PROPER.  THE IRAQI 
GOVERNMENT'S AVAILABILITY IS IMPORTANT, IN ORDER TO GET FROM 
THE INSPECTORS ALL THE NECESSARY CLARITY THAT WE ASK OF 
THEM," SAID FORMIGONI. 
 
¶4. (SBU) EMBASSY FINDS IT SIGNIFICANT THAT ROCCO BUTTIGLIONE, 
MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO FOR EU POLICIES, CONSIDERED VERY 
CLOSE TO POPE JOHN PAUL II, REFUSED TO MEET WITH TAREQ AZIZ 
THIS TIME.  BUTTIGLIONE HAD MET WITH AZIZ SEVERAL TIMES IN 
THE PAST.  HE WAS INVITED BY AZIZ TO BAGHDAD IN AUGUST, BUT 
DECLINED THE INVITATION.  BUTTIGLIONE SAID HE WANTED THE GOI 
TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE ON IRAQ.

THE OPPOSITION 
-------------- 
 
¶5. (U) IN PRESS STATEMENTS AFTER HIS MEETING FEB. 13 WITH THE 
OLIVE TREE (OPPOSITION) LEADERS, AZIZ SAID THAT "THE FACT 
THAT THE US DOES NOT CONSIDER THE WORK OF THE UN INSPECTORS 
TO BE IMPORTANT SHOWS THAT IT ONLY WANTS TO DOMINATE THAT 
AREA OF THE WORLD AND IT WANTS TO CONTROL IRAQ'S OIL." 
 
THE FOLLOWING IS AN INFORMAL TRANSLATION OF A STATEMENT BY 
THE OLIVE TREE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES GROUP LEADERS AT THE 
CONCLUSION OF THEIR MEETING WITH AZIZ: 
"DURING THE MEETING, WE REITERATED THE OLIVE TREE'S POSITION 
AGAINST WAR AND IN FAVOR OF MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO FIND A 
PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS.  WE ALSO REITERATED THE NEED 
THAT HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS BE GUARANTEED IN 
IRAQ, AS WELL AS THE BASIC RIGHTS FOR A MODERN DEMOCRACY, 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UN RESOLUTIONS, AND THE RECOGNITION OF 
ALL THE NECESSARY WORKING CONDITIONS FOR THE UN INSPECTORS. 
THESE ARE FUNDAMENTAL CONDITIONS TO ALLOW FOR THE IRAQI 
POLITICAL SYSTEM TO ACQUIRE THE NECESSARY CREDIBILITY AND TO 
MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO AVOID WAR."
