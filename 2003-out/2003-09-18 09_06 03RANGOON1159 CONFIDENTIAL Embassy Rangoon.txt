¶1. (C) According to U Thaung Tun, MFA Director General for 
Political Affairs, the GOB has agreed to a visit within the 
next week by Indonesian Presidential Advisor Ali Alatas.  The 
DG told us on September 18 that the specific dates for the 
visit are "under negotiation," due primarily to the imminent 
departure of several GOB cabinet members to New York for the 
UNGA, but added that the visit would take place "within 
days."  (Note: The Italian and Indian Ambassadors told COM 
that they have heard Alatas will arrive as early as September 
¶21.  End note).  U Thaung Tun stressed to P/E Chief that 
Alatas would visit Burma only in his capacity as a personal 
envoy for President Megawati, and not on behalf of ASEAN. 
 
¶2. (C) Comment:  A visit by Alatas to Rangoon, just two weeks 
prior to the ASEAN Summit in Bali, provides an excellent 
opportunity for a key ASEAN country to press the SPDC regime 
to release Aung San Suu Kyi and her detained NLD colleagues. 
The SPDC will make every attempt to use his visit, and the 
expected September 30 visit of U.N. Special Envoy Razali (ref 
C), to soften the frosty reception that Burma will face in 
Bali.  Furthermore, it is likely that the SPDC will chastise 
Alatas for FM Wirajuda's recent public call for ASSK's 
release (ref A).  We hope that Alatas is prepared to bite 
back and deliver a strong message that there will be no 
political progress until the NLD leadership is released from 
detention.
