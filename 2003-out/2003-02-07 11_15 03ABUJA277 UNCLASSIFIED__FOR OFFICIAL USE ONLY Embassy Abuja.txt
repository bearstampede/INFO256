(SBU) Minister of Commerce Precious Ngelale on February 7 
told the DCM Nigeria would oppose any effort that would delay 
the implementation of a solution to the current impasse over 
the Doha Declaration on Public Health. He said Nigeria would 
not support expansion of the moratorium to cover conditions 
other than HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other deadly 
infectious diseases afflicting Africans. He concluded, "We 
agree completely with the U.S. position. I don't think it 
would be difficult to get many of my colleagues to agree as 
well."
