(C) MFA U/S Ziyal and Ambassador briefly discussed the 
functioning of the Turkish liaison officers in Iraq over 
lunch June 10.  Ziyal opened by saying that Turkish LNOs were 
a source of confidence for Turkey.  They relay information, 
keep GOT officials informed about the real situation on the 
ground and help alleviate speculation and unnecessary 
worries.  Ziyal stressed the GOT was appreciative of the 
cooperation extended to the TU LNOs by the US forces, in 
particular those under the command of 101st Commanding 
General MG Petreaus.  Ziyal noted, however, that TGS had 
reported that the TU LNO teams in Kirkuk were experiencing 
some problems.  Specifically, Ziyal said the TU LNOs 
reportedly had been denied permission to leave their base, 
asked to change offices without justification, denied an 
internet connection and restricted from entering certain 
areas of the base.  Ziyal expressed hope the situation 
involving the TU LNOs in Kirkuk would improve in the future.
