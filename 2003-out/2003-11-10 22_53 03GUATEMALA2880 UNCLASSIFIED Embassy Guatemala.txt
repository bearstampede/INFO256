Per ref A instructions, the Ambassador spoke with Foreign 
Minister Edgar Gutierrez on November 10.  Gutierrez, who was 
enjoying a local holiday in the wake of national elections 
here yesterday, was unaware of the details of our proposals 
but promised he would not wait until tomorrow to contact his 
staff.  The text of Secretary Powell's letter to Gutierrez on 
this topic (ref B) was delivered via diplomatic note to the 
Foreign Ministry on Friday, November 7.  PolOff had earlier 
discussed ref C points with acting Director for Multilateral 
Affairs, Luis Carranza, on November 6.  That discussion led 
us to believe that Guatemala was open to the idea of 
consolidating some of the resolutions and possibly to at 
least abstain on others.
