BRIEFING 
 
 
Cyprus:  In a change of rhetoric, UBP leader and outgoing 
TRNC Prime Minister Dervis Eroglu said the Annan Plan is 
negotiable.  Turkish dailies were surprised by Eroglu's 
change in tone.  Eroglu, just like Turkish Cypriot leader 
Denktas,  has been a staunch opponent of the Annan Plan. 
Denktas is expected to designate a new prime minister 
following the oath-taking ceremony on Friday.  The UBP and 
CTP leaders have given moderate messages of compromise, and 
DP leader Serdar Denktas vowed to extend unconditional 
support to a coalition under Eroglu's leadership. 
Meanwhile, in an effort to contribute to a peaceful solution 
to the Cyprus problem, Turkey's ambassadors to 15 EU 
countries and the Turkish Ambassador to the United States 
will meet in Ankara on December 25-26 to discuss Cyprus. 
 
 
EU list of terror organizations:  The EU is expected to 
announce today a new list of terrorist organizations. 
Ankara is worried that the PKK/KADEK and its successor, KHK, 
are not included in the list.  The EU reviewed the list on 
December 15 in light of alleged Al-Qaeda connections to the 
recent bombings in Istanbul.  A recent report released by 
Europol said that organizations linked to Al-Qaeda regard EU 
countries as bases for logistical support and a vast pool of 
potential militant recruits. 
 
 
74.4 percent of Turks want EU Membership:  According to an 
opinion poll conducted by Bosphorus University, which 
sampled the views of 2,123 people in 20 provinces, 74.4 
percent of Turks want to join the EU.  However, 45 percent 
are concerned that EU membership could reduce Turkey's 
national sovereignty.  Researchers believe the AK Party had 
been successful in convincing its grassroots to support 
Turkey's EU aspiration. 
 
 
Turkey, Greece reach energy agreement:  Caspian Sea basin 
natural gas will be delivered to Europe via Greece, papers 
report.  Turkey's Energy Minister Guler signed an energy 
agreement with Greek Oil Minister Tsohatzopoulos on Tuesday. 
Tsohatzopoulos said the agreement would enable Turkey to 
 
SIPDIS 
become established in the European energy market.  The EU 
will need 100 billion cubic meters of natural gas after 
2005, according to reports.  The Turkish press characterized 
the deal as the first step for Turkey to establish itself as 
an `energy bridge' to Europe. 
 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: Libya; Iraq 
 
 
"The Libya Example" 
Sami Kohen commented in mass appeal Millyet (12/24): "The 
surprisingly rational and realistic new approach by Qadhafi 
is comforting news for the whole world.  More importantly, 
it is such a good Christmas gift for Bush and Blair.  . The 
Libyan leader apparently felt strong pressure mounting 
against his isolation policies, and figured out that he must 
change his stance on WMD and terrorism in the post-war era. 
He made a clever move by establishing a dialogue with the 
Western world instead of defying it.  Unlike Saddam Hussein, 
Qadhafi corrected his mistakes in time.  The Libya example 
also proves that diplomacy is still the best option for 
resolving international disputes, a method that was not used 
in the case of Iraq." 
 
 
"US and Kurds" 
Fatih Altayli warned in mass appeal Hurriyet (12/24): 
"Turkey's reaction against  developments in Iraq, 
particularly with regard to the Iraqi Kurds, is sometimes 
very paranoid.  Sometimes we worry without even considering 
the realities and seeing the nuances.  If you read the 
headlines in the Turkish papers, Turkey is now worried about 
the establishment of a federal Kurdistan.  The headline- 
makers are unfortunately taking into account only the 
statements from the Iraqi Kurds.  In reality, it is going to 
be all Iraqis -- not only the Kurds -- who will determine 
Iraq's future. . In reality, the Iraqi Kurds are seeking a 
federal Kurdish state and expect US support in exchange for 
the  support they gave the US during the war.  At this 
point, this is only a hope for the Kurds, because there is 
no evidence that the US supports the idea.  Moreover, the US 
does not have a clear plan for Iraq yet.  Turkey should 
enhance its bilateral ties with the US and exert its 
regional influence.  It seems that everybody but Turkey 
realizes that nothing can happen contrary to Turkey's 
desire."
