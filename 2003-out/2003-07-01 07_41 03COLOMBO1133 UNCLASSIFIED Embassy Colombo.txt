NOMINATING-OFFICER: Bruce A. Lohof 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Mr. Upul Joseph Fernando has been a reputed political 
coulmnist in the Sinhala press for the past ten years. 
 His interests in politics, especially in conflict 
studies, has allowed him to head the National Academy 
for Political Education (NAPE), which is affiliated to 
the ruling United National Party.  NAPE conducts 
training for budding politicians such as grassroot 
level political activists, local government and 
provincial council politicians.  Therefore, Mr. 
Fernando's role as its director is vital to the 
country's future leaders.  In addition to his work at 
NAPE, he continues to regularly write for the Sinhala 
press on current political issues, especially on 
conflict resolution and the peace process. 
Although he has had a short experience in the U.S. in 
1999, this promising young researcher cum journalist 
should have a properly structured exposure to the U.S. 
through an IV program such as "Preventive Diplomacy and 
Conflict Resolution."
