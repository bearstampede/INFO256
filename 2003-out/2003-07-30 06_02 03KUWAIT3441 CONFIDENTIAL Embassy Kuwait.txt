(reftel) with Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Khaled 
Al-Jarallah during their July 27 meeting. 
 
¶2. (C) Jarallah was supportive of the USG position, and said 
he welcomed the reaction of the international community, 
which he described as "tough" and "united," to Iran's 
continued obfuscation with regard to its nuclear program. 
Jarallah said Iran was "damaging its interests in the 
international community by not listening to (the 
international community's) recommendations....We hope they 
got the lesson from Iraq," he added. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment:  While it was unclear what specific action 
the GOK will take on this front, Kuwait is clearly supportive 
of our efforts to seek a report by August 15.  End Comment.
