Reasons 1.5 (b, d and e) 
 
(C) Canada is working to implement nationally all of the 
decisions taken at the 2003 Australia Group plenary (reftel). 
 Marina Laker, Foreign Affairs' Deputy Director for 
Non-Proliferation, confirmed to us that Canada will not break 
silence on the addition of 9 new chemicals to AG export 
controls.  She said that Canada is also emphasizing regional 
non-proliferation, most recently in meetings with Israel, and 
that the GoC will be reporting on its efforts to the AG 
Chair.  Canada publicly reported its most recent export 
control changes (based on 2002 legislation) at the February 
2003 intersessional, and hopes to have new changes to report 
in the next 6 months.  Laker said she believed Canada had 
already provided information on its relevant laws, 
regulations, control lists and internet web sites to the AG 
Chair, but that she will reconfirm.
