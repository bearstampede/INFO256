THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 
 
 
REF: STATE 126276 
 
 
Classified by A/Polcouns Philip Kaplan for reason 1.5 (b) and 
(d). 
 
 
¶1. (C) We delivered reftel demarche May 15 to Gokcen Kaya, 
MFA Department Head for the United Nations.  Kaya noted the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict is on 
the Turkish Parliament's agenda for ratification during this 
session.  MFA will advise when Parliament ratifies.  Turkey 
has already ratified ILO Convention No. 182 and the Protocol 
on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child 
Pornography. 
 
 
¶2. (C) In response to Kaya's query whether the U.S. would 
ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child, we 
explained that, unlike in other countries, U.S. state and 
local jurisdictions have primary authority over this issue 
and that U.S. law and custom already afford children 
protection.
