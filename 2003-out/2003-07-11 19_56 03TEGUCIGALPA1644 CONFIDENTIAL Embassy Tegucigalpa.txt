SIPDIS 
 
REF: A. STATE 184648 
     ¶B. STATE 175664 
 
Classified By: Political Chief Francisco Palmieri; 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On June 27, PolChief discussed the Government of 
Honduras' (GOH) participation in the 58th United Nations 
General Assembly (UNGA) and U.S. UNGA policy priorities with 
Honduran Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Anibal Quinones 
(reftels).  Quinones indicated that Honduras looked forward 
to working closely with the U.S. government at the UNGA, 
especially on Iraq-related issues, cloning, and budget 
reform.  Honduras is slated to receive more than USD 40 
million from the UN HIV/AIDS Global Fund, which makes it the 
largest recipient in Central America. Honduras is also slated 
to be the UNGA Vice President of the Second Committee, where 
we expect to work closely with them on Second Committee 
reform and overall UN budget reform. 
 
¶2.  (C) While VM Quinones could only confirm the attendance 
of Foreign Minister Perez-Cadalso at this time, he asked if 
it would be possible to arrange a brief meeting between 
Secretary Powell and FM Perez-Cadalso at the UNGA.  He made a 
 
SIPDIS 
direct reference to Honduras being a member of the Coalition 
of the Willing, its recently approved troop deployment to 
Iraq and the ratification of the Article 98 agreement.  He 
subsequently told the Ambassador in a separate meeting that 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been subject to some 
domestic political criticism on both issues and that the 
Maduro government would be very vulnerable to opposition 
party criticism during their troop's deployment in Iraq. 
 
 
¶3. (C) Comment: Post supports this request for a brief 
meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister.  Current 
military planning calls for the Honduran troops to be fully 
deployed to the field by September 1.  In addition to 
solidifying Honduran military participation in the 
reconstruction of Iraq, a brief meeting with the FM would 
also provide an opportunity for the Secretary to highlight 
the HIV-AIDS Global Fund's contributions in Latin America and 
to engage the Honduran government on the need for it to play 
a leading role in drafting a Cuba human rights resolution at 
next spring's UNHRC, now that they have won a seat on that 
body.  The meeting would also send a much-needed and strong 
political boost to the Maduro government and the MFA, both of 
which have been steadfast in support of key U.S. foreign 
policy objectives throughout this year.  End Comment.
