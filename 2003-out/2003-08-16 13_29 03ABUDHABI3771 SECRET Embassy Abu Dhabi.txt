SUBJECT:  SUPPORTING THE TRANSITION IN IRAQ; GC 
TO VISIT ABU DHABI 
 
Ref: State 238110 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Charge d'Affaires, a.i., 
Richard Albright, for Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) Summary: Charge discussed reftel points 
during a August 16 telcon with de facto Foreign 
Minister Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al Nahyan that 
also included a discussion of an upcoming visit 
to the UAE by Iraq Governing Council (GC) 
President, Dr. Ebrahim Jafari and five GC 
members.  The GC delegation, which will fly in 
aboard an Emirati flight from Baghdad, is 
scheduled to meet with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince 
Shaykh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Shaykh 
Hamdan.  HbZ promised a strong statement backing 
the Governing Council and continued UAE economic 
and humanitarian support in Iraq.  End Summary. 
 
¶3. (C) In response to reftel points encouraging 
UAEG support, and recognition of, the current 
political process in Iraq and Iraqi 
reconstruction, Sh. Hamdan affirmed his 
country's continuing commitment to Iraq.  He 
noted the UAEG's ongoing humanitarian, medical, 
and transportation assistance.  During the visit 
of the Governing Council, the UAEG will issue a 
public statement that is "stronger and clearer 
than those of Oman and Qatar recently."  The 
statement will say that the UAEG strongly 
supports the Iraq GC.  Hamdan told Charge that 
his government wishes the GC a "fruitful and 
successful visit."   Their visit represents a 
"good step," he added. 
 
¶4. (C) The UAEG's strong message in support of the 
GC should encourage other countries to follow suit, 
Hamdan said.  He singled out "negative statements" 
made by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria.  Hamdan 
expressed disappointment at the Arab League for not 
being more proactive in sending delegations to 
Baghdad to meet with the GC.  Instead, he said, it 
is the Iranians who have sent delegation after 
delegation to Baghdad.  "We think it should have 
been the other way around," he said.  The Charge 
conveyed USG appreciation for the UAEG role in 
Iraq. 
 
¶5. (S) In regard to Pakistan and Turkey, HbZ said 
the UAEG hoped they would participate and said he 
would look for appropriate opportunities to convey 
this message. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Hamdan said he was delighted to learn that 
both Gulf Air and Emirates Airlines were selected 
to fill slots at Basra airport.  This decision will 
not only be beneficial to the two airlines, but 
also to the Iraqi people, and will boost the level 
of economic exchange between the Gulf countries and 
Iraq.
