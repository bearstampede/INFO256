¶2. (C) Turkish MFA DG for Mideast Affairs Burcuoglu told 
Charge August 14 that Turkey had decided to augment either 
the UK Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Mazar-e-Sharif 
or the German one in Konduz.  He said his office would be 
contacting TGS as well as the British and German embassies to 
begin planning for the Turkish contribution. 
 
 
¶3. (C) In addition, Burcuoglu expressed concern that Afghan 
Minister of Defense Fehim Han and forces loyal to him, 
including Ustat Ata, have been conducting a propaganda 
campaign against Gen. Dostum.  The GOT is concerned that 
Fehim Han and "other warlords" are determined to get rid of 
Dostum because the latter is "clearly on the side of the Bonn 
Process" and has tried to stem the trafficking of arms from 
Pakistan.  The GOT is concerned the campaign against Dostum 
could escalate to military clashes.  The GOT was advising 
Dostum to avoid provocative action and hoped that the USG was 
applying similar pressure to rival warlords and supporting 
those figures dedicated to peace in Afghanistan.
