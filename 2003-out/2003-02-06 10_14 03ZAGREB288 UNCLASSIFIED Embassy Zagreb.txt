PAGE 02        ZAGREB  00288  061035Z 
HELPED: IT OCCURRED SHORTLY BEFORE CROATIA'S NIGHTLY NEWS 
BROADCASTS, FACILITATING EXTENSIVE PLAY ON TV AND RADIO 
NEWS.  MUCH FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE VILNIUS GROUP'S STATEMENT 
OF SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. POSITION ISSUED AFTER POWELL'S 
PRESENTATION (REFTEL).  WHILE NOT AN INCOMING NATO MEMBER 
LIKE MOST OTHERS IN THE V-10, CROATIA BELONGS TO THIS 
GROUP. 
 
¶2.   THERE HAVE BEEN FEW COMMENTARIES YET.  ONE WAS 
FEATURED PROMINENTLY IN THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED DAILY 
"VJESNIK" ON FEBRUARY 6 BY BRUNO LOPANDIC UNDER THE 
HEADLINE "CROATIA WILL HAVE TO TAKE A CLEARER POSITION 
TOWARD THE IRAQI CRISIS."  LOPANDIC WROTE THAT THE VILNIUS 
GROUP STATEMENT WAS INITIATED BY BRUCE JACKSON.  HE NOTED 
THAT CROATIA'S INSISTENCE ON SIGNING SUCH A DOCUMENT WILL 
"FORCE THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT TO DECIDE MORE CLEARLY" HOW 
CROATIA SHOULD POSITION ITSELF ON THE ISSUE. 
 
¶3.   THERE HAS BEEN NO OFFICIAL GOC REACTION YET OTHER THAN 
THE V-10 STATEMENT TO THE SECRETARY'S PRESENTATION.  WE 
EXPECT MORE COMMENTARIES AND ANALYSIS IN COMING DAYS AND 
WILL REPORT SEPTEL.
