¶1. (U) Classified by Richard A. Albright, Charge d'Affaires, 
a.i., for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (U) On September 3, the UAE Foreign Ministry issued a 
statement welcoming the formation of the new government in 
Iraq.  In it, the UAEG expressed faith in the ability of the 
Iraqi Governing Council (GC) and the new government to 
overcome the difficult circumstances it is experiencing. 
"The UAE considers the proclamation of the new government a 
significant positive step added to previous moves to allow 
the Iraqi people to run their own affairs and restore 
security and stability to their country," the official 
source at the Foreign Ministry said.  The source added that 
the UAE is ready to cooperate with the new government for 
the good of the Iraqi people, and called on Iraqis to join 
forces with the new government to enable it to carry out its 
important tasks. 
 
¶3. (C) The UAEG has consistently supported the GC (refs B 
and C), and has told Charge that it will lobby for the 
Iraqis' inclusion in the upcoming Arab League ministerial 
deliberations (ref A).
