SUBJECT: GUATEMALA WILL CONSIDER OAS BUDGET INCREASE IN JUNE 
 
REF: STATE 50110 
 
Â¶1.  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Acting Director 
General for Multilateral Affairs, Sylvia Corado, at the 
Foreign Ministry on February 28.  Corado said she would have 
to consult internally before she could speak officially. 
However, she speculated that, given "severe" budget 
constraints, the MFA would be hard-pressed to find an 
additional $5,000 for the OAS.  On March 4, Poloffs spoke to 
Jose Felix Palma, Director of the OAS office in Guatemala 
City.  Palma indicated his discussions with the MFA were 
proceeding positively.   Corado told us on March 5 that while 
the MFA understood the symbolic importance of Guatemala's 
small increase, her internal consultations had indicated it 
was unlikely Guatemala would be able to increase its 
contribution.  PolCouns raised the issue with Giovanni 
Castillo, Director General for Multilateral Affairs, upon 
Castillo's return from the NAM summit.  Castillo said that 
due to the MFA's budget cycle, it would be June before the 
proposal to increase the contribution to the OAS could be 
considered.
