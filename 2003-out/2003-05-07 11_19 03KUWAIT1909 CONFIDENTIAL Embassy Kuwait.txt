SUBJECT: GOK CONCERNED ABOUT IRAQI DEBT REDUCTION PROPOSAL 
 
REF: STATE 108252 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reason 1.5 (d) 
 
¶1. (C) The Ambassador discussed Iraqi debt (reftel), and the 
issue of Oil For Food (OFF) revenues for the UNCC with 
Kuwaiti MinState for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed 
Al-Sabah during their April 29 meeting.  Dr. Mohammed 
expressed great concern over possible plans for Iraqi debt 
reduction, as Iraq maintains a considerable debt to Kuwait. 
 
¶2. (C) The Ambassador suggested to Dr. Mohammed that although 
there is no inherent link between the issue of debt 
forgiveness and UNCC payments, it would be expedient for 
Kuwait to consider making a significant, early contribution 
to reconstruction efforts if it hoped to combat efforts to 
reduce OFF payments to the UNCC. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment:  Although it is unclear if Kuwait will take 
action on this suggestion, it is clear that the possibility 
of a reduction in UNCC revenues and/or debt relief is taken 
very seriously by the GOK; the outcome of these issues will 
surely be judged by the Kuwaitis in light of their 
indispensable contributions to OIF.
