SUBJECT: IMO BUDGET DEMARCHE:  DUTCH RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 319349 
 
¶1.     (U) EconOff delivered ref demarche concerning the 
proposed IMO 2004-05 budget increase to Ms. Marja Tiemens of 
the Ministry of Transport on November 17.  Ms. Tiemens said 
the Netherlands feels the 13.6% increase is "high, but not 
excessive."  The Dutch have doubts that the current budget 
will be adequate to support the IMO's expanding tasks, 
including those in the area of maritime security, and 
therefore "extra investment" may be needed.  Nevertheless, 
the Dutch will have a number of questions for the IMO council 
about the budget, specifically on the increase in personnel 
and what they see as questionable return on investment from 
IT expenditures. 
 
¶2.     (SBU) Comment:  The Dutch pay a high degree of 
attention to the IMO and are budget-minded themselves. 
Therefore, they could be useful allies to USG efforts to 
reform the organization.  However, their instinct to support 
all institutions multilateral may prevent them from taking a 
firm position against escalating budgets.  End Comment.
