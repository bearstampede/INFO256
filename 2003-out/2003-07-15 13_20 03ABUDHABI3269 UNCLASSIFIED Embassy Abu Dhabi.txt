SUBJECT:  UAEG FORMALLY REQUESTS TIFA NEGOTIATIONS 
 
 
¶1. The UAEG has formally notified us that it wants to 
negotiate a Free Trade Agreement (TIFA) with the U.S. and 
that, as a first step, it is prepared to negotiate a Trade 
and Investment Framework Agreement with the U.S. 
 
¶2. UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan 
bin Zayed told the Ambassador that the UAEG is interested 
in negotiating a TIFA with the U.S.  He also said that he 
has seen a copy of the U.S.-Bahrain TIFA and is circulating 
it throughout UAE ministries.   Ministry of Finance and 
Industry Assistant Undersecretary Khalid Al-Bustani passed 
Econchief a letter (dated June 16) from the Minister of 
Finance and Industry Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum to 
Treasury Secretary Snow expressing substantially the same 
points.  Al-Bustani told Econchief that the Ministry of 
Finance had passed the letter to the MFA for transmission. 
 
¶3. Action Request: Please advise as to next steps we should 
take with the UAEG.  The UAE is very interested in 
negotiating both a TIFA and a free trade agreement.  End 
Action Request.
