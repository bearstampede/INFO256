SUBJECT: REACTION IN YEMEN TO SADDAM'S CAPTURE 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J. Hull, Reasons 1.5(b,d) 
 
¶1. (C) Saddam's capture dominated discussion at UAE National 
Day December 14 with numerous Yemenis seeking Ambassador out 
to congratulate him.  Saddam's surrender without a fight 
surprised many.  Shura Council member Mohammed Tayeb told 
Ambassador in confidence that President Saleh had reacted 
angrily to Saddam's surrender because Saddam allowed himself 
to be taken without a fight.  Saudi Ambassador Khattani noted 
humiliation of Saddam's meek and degrading appearance during 
medical examination.  Several Yemeni's confirmed that 
Saddam's image had been deflated in their eyes.  Other 
comments welcomed the role of Iraqi Governing council and the 
Iraqi court in meting out justice to the former president. 
In presenting congratulations, one Iraqi-American expressed 
hope that Saddam's capture would close a long, sad chapter in 
Iraqi history and allow Iraqi's to turn to rebuilding their 
country. 
 
¶2. (C) COMMENT:  The public diplomacy of Saddam's arrest, in 
our estimation, was nothing short of brilliant, and its 
impact is already clear in Yemeni.
