SUBJECT:  TFIZ01: IRAQIS REFUSE PERMISSION TO UAE RED 
CRESCENT SOCIETY TO DELIVER AID TO REGIME-CONTROLLED 
AREAS 
 
REF: ABU DHABI 1512 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C) Sana'a Al-Kitbi (strictly protect), Secretary- 
General of the UAE Red Crescent Authority, told us on 
the afternoon of April 2 that all UAE Red Crescent 
humanitarian relief activities in Iraq are on hold. 
The reason is that the Iraqis have officially refused 
permission to the UAE to deliver aid in regime- 
controlled areas.  Al-Kitbi said that as a result of 
the Iraqi decision, the only place the UAE could 
deliver its aid would be Umm Qasr and its environs. 
(Note:  The Red Crescent had been planning to deliver 
aid across the country, focusing on the neediest 
areas, many of which they judge to be in regime- 
controlled territory.  End note.)  The entire issue of 
humanitarian aid for Iraq has now become -- because of 
Iraq's refusal to cooperate -- a matter of enormous 
political sensitivity.  RCA humanitarian aid shipments 
must wait until the UAE leadership decides how best to 
respond. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Comment:  Al-Kitbi had earlier told us that 
while Baghdad might refuse aid from Saudi Arabia and 
Kuwait, she was confident that the Iraqis would grant 
permission for Emirati relief activities because of 
the UAE's long and close association with the Iraqi 
Red Crescent Society (see reftel).  That assessment 
appears to have been incorrect.  The Ambassador has 
requested an early appointment with MFA Minstate (and 
RCA Chairman) Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid, and will use 
the opportunity of that meeting to press for the UAE 
to move forward to deliver its much-needed aid to 
those areas in Iraq where it will be safe for them to 
do so -- noting that that area is expanding every day.
