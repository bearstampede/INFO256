SUBJECT:  TFIZ01 (EAC): ABU DHABI SITREP NO. 14, APRIL 5 
 
REF: ABU DHABI 1601 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for reasons 
1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
---------------- 
General Overview 
---------------- 
 
2.(U) DCM convened Abu Dhabi's Iraq Task Force/core Emergency 
Action Committee (EAC) at 1000 local time, 4/05.  Embassy Abu 
Dhabi, FCS (located outside of the Embassy compound), and the 
USGS office in Al Ain are open 4/05 with full staffing. 
 
-------- 
SECURITY 
-------- 
 
¶3. (S/NF) ORCA reported no new threats or additional 
developments on previous warnings. 
 
¶4.  (C) RSO reported that permission for an anti-war 
demonstration in Abu Dhabi on April 4 was denied by the 
police. RSO also received information of possible 
demonstrations in Dubai and the northern Emirate of Sharjah 
in the near future. 
 
----------------------- 
UAEG Actions/Statements 
----------------------- 
 
5.(C) ECON reported that the Red Crescent Authority now 
indicates that it plans to send a humanitarian shipment to 
Umm Qasr.  The Embassy will work out the necessary shipping 
details with the HOC in Kuwait -- the Emiratis prefer to deal 
with only one line of contact -- and they will distribute their 
relief supplies themselves. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Local Media 
---------------------------------- 
 
6.(U) PAO noted that local media is now focusing on the 
structure of post-conflict Iraq. Allegations abound of U.S. 
desire to colonize and control the region, but overall 
language has been toned down in some papers. 
 
7.(U) Abu Dhabi Iraq Task Force/EAC will reconvene at 1000 
local time, 4/07. 
 
8.(U) Iraq Task Force/EAC members in attendance included 
DCM, RSO, DAO, P/M, POL, ECON, CONS, MSG, OBO, PAO, ADMIN, 
USLO, FBI.
