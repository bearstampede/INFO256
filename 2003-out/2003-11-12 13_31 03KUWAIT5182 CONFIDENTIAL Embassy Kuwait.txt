¶1.  (C)  In a courtesy call on November 10 in preparation for 
the Ambassador's departure for temporary duty in Baghdad, 
Kuwait Prime Minister Sabah Al-Ahmed confirmed that Kuwait is 
committed to Iraq reconstruction.  He said that unlike other 
countries, all of Kuwait's remaining $500 million commitment 
would be in the form of grants: $100 million from the Fund 
for Iraq and $400 million from the Kuwait Fund.  The GOK had 
decided, Sabah said, to concentrate on education and health 
care in Iraq.  "We will build schools and hospitals and will 
spend our own money to do it," explaining that Kuwait wanted 
to leave lasting reminders of its generosity to influence 
future generations of Iraquis to have a positive image of the 
country.  He also said that Kuwait was open to discussion 
with the IGC what other priorities should be considered. 
Everything is on the table "except arms."  We won't be giving 
any weapons to anybody in Iraq," he confirmed. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Sabah also wished the Ambassador well in his new 
assignment.  While his departure imposed personal sacrifice 
"we are all counting on you and you can count on us to work 
with you for the mutual benefit of all our countries." 
 
¶3.  (U)  Baghdad minimize considered.
