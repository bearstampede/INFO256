SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON CAFTA, JUNE 20, 2003 
 
 
Â¶1. Editorial on Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La Tribuna" 
on 6/20 entitled "Kindergarten". "CAFTA negotiations have 
encountered a serious obstacle because the Central American 
countries have not been able to present a consistent 
position, debilitating its already fragile negotiation 
power, and evidencing the contradictions we face because we 
do not want to understand the need to present ourselves as a 
solid bloc." 
 
"From the beginning, Central America should have worked in 
an unified project, considering the regional needs and 
proposals. Before initiating the negotiations with the other 
counterpart, Central America must have agreed on a common 
position." 
 
"All these problems could have been easily avoided, because 
from a good negotiation process we can come out with a CAFTA 
with manageable disadvantages and far-reaching benefits for 
everyone."
