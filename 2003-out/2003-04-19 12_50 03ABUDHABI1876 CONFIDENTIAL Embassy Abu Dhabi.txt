SUBJECT: DEMARCHING THE ARAB MULTILATERAL AID 
AGENCIES 
 
REF:  A) STATE 100455, B) KUWAIT 1468 
 
¶1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY DCM RICHARD A. ALBRIGHT FOR 
REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶2.  (C)  ECONCHIEF RAISED REF A DEMARCHE APRIL 19 
WITH FINANCE MINISTRY UNDERSECRETARY KHALID AL- 
BUSTANI.  AL-BUSTANI SAID THAT THE UAE WOULD BE 
FAVORABLY DISPOSED TOWARDS CONSIDERATION OF WAYS 
IN WHICH THE ARAB FUND FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 
DEVELOPMENT (AFESD) COULD ENGAGE POSTIVELY WITH 
IRAQ.  THAT SAID, HE NOTED THAT THE UAE AS HOST OF 
THE UPCOMING BOARD OF GOVERNORS MEETING -- AND AS 
AN ONLY MODEST CONTRIBUTOR TO AFESD -- WOULD NOT 
BE PREPARED TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE ON THIS 
ISSUE.  HOWEVER, AS LONG AS AFSED DG ABDULLATIF 
AL-HAMAD WAS FULLY ON BOARD, THE UAEG OFFICIAL 
PREDICTED THAT THE MATTER WOULD BE WELL IN HAND. 
 
¶3.  (C)  AL-BUSTANI NOTED THAT THE APRIL 22-23 
GATHERING IN ABU DHABI WOULD BE BROADER THAN JUST 
THE AFESD SESSION.  THE ARAB MONETARY FUND BOARD 
WOULD ALSO BE MEETING, AS WOULD A NUMBER OF 
SMALLER ARAB MULTILATERAL LENDING INSTITUTIONS, 
SUCH AS THE ARAB AUTHORITY FOR AGRICULTURAL 
DEVELOPMENT AND THE ARAB ORGANIZATION FOR 
INVESTMENT PROTECTION.  IF THE USG'S INTEREST IS 
IN SEEKING IRAQ'S REHABILITATION, WE WOULD BE WELL 
ADVISED TO CAST OUR NET MORE BROADLY THAN JUST 
AFESD, THE EMIRATI REMARKED. 
 
¶4.  (C)  COMMENT:  AL-BUSTANI'S OBSERVATION 
STRIKES US AS ON TARGET.  WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE 
ARAB MONETARY FUND -- WHICH IS ACTUALLY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR ORGANIZING THE APRIL 22-23 
MEETINGS -- IS CURRENTLY OWED MORE THAN 369 
MILLION USD BY IRAQ (189 MILLION IN PRINCIPAL, THE 
REST IN INTEREST).  IRAQ HAS MADE NO PAYMENTS TO 
THE AMF IN MORE THAN A DECADE, THE NUMBER TWO 
OFFICIAL TOLD ECONOFF IN LATE 2002.  POST 
THEREFORE SUGGESTS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE AFESD- 
SPECIFIC POINTS OUTLINED IN REF. A, CONSIDERATION 
BE GIVEN TO BROADENING THE DEMARCHE TO ASK THAT 
ALL THE RELEVANT ARAB FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
MEETING IN ABU DHABI LATER THIS MONTH TAKE THE 
NECESSARY STEPS TO ENGAGE POSITIVELY WITH IRAQ AND 
PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE PROCESS OF 
RECONSTRUCTION.
