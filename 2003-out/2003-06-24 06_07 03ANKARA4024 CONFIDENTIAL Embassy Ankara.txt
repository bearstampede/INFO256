(C) Econoff delivered ref B points urging the GOT to 
implement catch-all export controls to Ali Riza Oktay, 
Department Head at the Turkish Foreign Trade 
Undersecretariat's Exports General Directorate, on June 13. 
Oktay acknowledged that Turkey does not now have catch-all 
control regulations, but stated that in practice the GOT has 
sometimes denied permission to export sensitive items without 
regulatory authority to do so.  He said that the Turkey 
informed other Australia Group members at the recent AG 
plenary that it aims to align its regulations in this area 
with those of the EU.  Turkey plans to implement catch-all 
regulations following a briefing by EU experts on this 
subject, now scheduled for September.
