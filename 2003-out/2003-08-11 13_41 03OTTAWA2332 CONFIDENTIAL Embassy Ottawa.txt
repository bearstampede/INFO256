SUBJECT: MASS GRAVES PROJECT IN IRAQ: CANADA PLANS TO ASSIST 
 
REF: HQ CPA BAGHDAD TELEGRAM DTG 111341Z AUG 03 
 
Classified By: Acting Political Minister Counselor Mary Witt, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) Canada plans to provide a forensics team to assist with 
exhumation at mass grave sites in Iraq (reftel).  Wendy 
Gilmore of Foreign Affairs' Regional Security Office told us 
that Canadian police are experienced in this area, having 
done similar work at mass grave sites in Kosovo and Bosnia. 
The personnel the GoC would call on are currently doing an 
investigation at a mass murder site in the Vancouver area, 
but they should be available by early fall.  Gilmore said the 
police would want to know whether the exhumation is being 
done to account for individuals, build a case for a possible 
tribunal, or both, as this would affect how the sites are 
handled.  Gilmore will be in touch with Sandra Hodgkinson to 
discuss this further.
