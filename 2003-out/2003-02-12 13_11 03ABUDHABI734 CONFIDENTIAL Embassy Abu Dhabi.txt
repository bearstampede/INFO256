¶1. (U) Classified by Charge Thomas E. Williams for 
reasons 1.5 (b,d). 
 
¶2.  (C)  The UAEG is prepared to begin deploying a 
brigade-plus military force to Kuwait by as early 
as February 16, but is waiting for clearance from 
the GOK with regard to acceptance of forces and 
basing/logistical arrangements.  Aides to de facto 
Defense Minister Shaykh Muhammad bin Zayid Al- 
Nahyan (MBZ) separately briefed Ambassador and 
Polchief on the forces the UAE is prepared to 
deploy.  These include: 
 
-- Two squadrons of Apache attack helicopters (12 
aircraft); 
 
-- One battalion of artillery; 
 
-- One tank battalion; 
 
-- Two battalions of BMP-3 armored personnel 
carriers; 
 
-- Two missile patrol boats; 
 
-- One chemical warfare decontamination company; 
and, 
 
-- One Electronic Warfare company. 
 
 
¶3.  (C)  Comment:  Having successfully lobbied the 
GOK to invoke the GCC mutual defense agreement in 
order to secure deployment of Peninsula Shield 
forces to Kuwait (see reftel), it is clear that the 
UAE wants to respond promptly and fully to Kuwait's 
request.  UAEG officials say they believe Saudi 
Arabia has also agreed to deploy forces, but had no 
further details on composition of the Saudi 
contribution; they did suggest, however, that it 
would likely take "some time" before Saudi forces 
would be prepared to deploy.
