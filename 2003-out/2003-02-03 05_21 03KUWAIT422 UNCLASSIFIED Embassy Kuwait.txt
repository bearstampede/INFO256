¶1. (U) During a February 1, 2003, meeting with Salah Abdul 
Redha A. Khourshid, Kuwait's Minister for Commerce and 
Industry (MOCI), the Ambassador requested that the GOK 
further delay implementation of its proposed International 
Conformity Certification Program (ICCP) to allow WTO members 
additional time to reply (reftel).  After consulting with his 
advisors, Khourshid agreed, stating that the GOK now plans to 
postpone the ICCP start date until at least March 17.

officials, including three officials from the Public 
Authority for Industry (PAI); the Ambassador was joined by

Acting Under Secretary Bader Abdul Rahim stated that in 
addition to the technical reasons cited (reftel), the GOK's 
commercial attache is presently involved in negotiations on 
technical aspects of the program with the WTO Secretariat. 
He added that the WTO has asked Kuwait to submit an 
explanatory paper before it moves forward with implementation.
