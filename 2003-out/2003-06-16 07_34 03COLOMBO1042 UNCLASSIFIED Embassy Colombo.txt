Ms. Constantine works to promote many of the ideas that 
the USG is working on in its promotion of human rights.

doing and is slowly becoming a community leader for the 
specific work she does in some issues.  It is in the 
USG's interest help promote her into a leadership role 
because of her sympathies for U.S. policies concerning
