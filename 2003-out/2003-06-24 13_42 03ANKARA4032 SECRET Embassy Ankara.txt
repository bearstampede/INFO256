SUBJECT: TURKS AGREE TO FACILITATE TRAVEL WHEN POSSIBLE 
 
REF: A) STATE 179144 
 
 
(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5 (b,d) 
 
 
¶1. (S)  Embassy confirmed with Turkish officials that they 
remain willing to ensure the two journalists will be able to 
transit Turkey as they travel to Prague when a new itinerary 
is developed.  GOT officials asked that their participation 
be kept confidential. During preparations for transit on June 
24, GOT officials requested that an official from the 
Consulate in Istanbul not participate in the transit to 
minimize the possibility of drawing attention to the 
travelers.  Separately, we had arranged with airport 
officials for permission to enter secured areas. A ConGen 
Istanbul official was going to be on the scene to confirm 
successful transit but maintaining a low profile so GOT 
officials would not upset. 
 
 
¶2. (S)  DCM spoke with the Deputy Director General for Middle 
Eastern Affairs Burcuoglu who personally conveyed the GOT's 
desire to be helpful in this matter.  He stressed that 
Turkish involvement must not become known publicly.  The Iran 
desk, responsible for actual coordination of the transit also 
repeated that they remain willing and able to assist with the 
transit when a new itinerary is developed.  They are prepared 
to send written instructions to their Embassy in Baku. 
 
 
¶3. (S) Embassy is coordinating changes in travel plans with 
ConGen Istanbul and will ensure an official is at the airport 
during any transit. 
 
 
¶4.  (U)  Point of contact in Ankara remains Consul Laura 
Dogu.  She can be reached through the Embassy switchboard at 
any time.  90-312-455-5555.
