REF: ROME 1506 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION EMIL SKODON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) 
AND (D). 
 
¶1. (SBU) EARLY ON APRIL 9 MFA SECRETARY GENERAL'S CHIEF OF 
STAFF, ANTONIO ZANARDI LANDI, SPOKE TO DCM TO FOLLOW UP 
PREVIOUS EVENING'S APPROACH RE SAFETY OF ITALIAN JOURNALISTS 
IN BAGHDAD (REFTEL).  DCM ADVISED THAT WE HAD PASSED ON GOI 
CONCERNS TO DEPARTMENT AND TO CENTCOM, AND REAFFIRMED THAT 
U.S. FORCES WERE DOING ALL THEY COULD TO AVOID CIVILIAN 
CASUALTIES.  DRAWING ON BACKGROUND RECEIVED FROM TASK FORCE, 
DCM ALSO TOLD ZANARDI LANDI THAT THE SITUATION IN BAGHDAD WAS 
VERY FLUID AS OF DAYBREAK IN IRAQ, AND IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS 
FOR ALL CONCERNED FOR U.S. FORCES TO TRY AND EVACUATE 
JOURNALISTS FROM THE PALESTINE OR SHERATON HOTELS.  THAT 
SAID, THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND WAS CHANGING RAPIDLY TODAY 
AND CENTCOM WOULD ADJUST AS THE ENVIRONMENT EVOLVED. 
 
¶2. (C) ZANARDI LANDI SAID THAT GOI HAD MANAGED TO REACH THE 
ITALIAN JOURNALISTS IN BAGHDAD AND HAD ASKED THEIR 
INTENTIONS, AS REQUESTED BY DCM.  THE SEVEN WHO HAD BEEN 
ARRESTED BY IRAQI OFFICIALS AND DETAINED IN THE PALESTINE 
HOTEL ADVISED THAT IRAQI AUTHORITIES HAD PROMISED TO RETURN 
THEIR PASSPORTS AND RELEASE THEM ON APRIL 9, AND ONCE THAT 
HAPPENED THEY WISHED TO DEPART BAGHDAD.  THE OTHER THIRTEEN 
ITALIAN MEDIA REPS AT THE PALESTINE AND SHERATON HOTELS 
PLANNED TO STAY TO COVER THE BATTLE.  DCM ASKED ZANARDI LANDI 
FOR NAMES AND MEDIA AFFILIATIONS OF THE SEVEN WHO HAD BEEN 
ARRESTED AND ALSO FOR THE OTHER ITALIAN JOURNALISTS IN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01524  01 OF 03  091639Z 
BAGHDAD, WHICH HE AGREED TO PROVIDE. 
 
¶3. (C) LATER IN THE DAY, WHILE ACCOMPANYING U/S BOLTON TO A 
CALL ON MFA SECGEN BALDOCCI, DCM ASKED BALDOCCI FOR AN UPDATE 
ON THE JOURNALISTS.  BALDOCCI SAID THE IRAQIS HAD RETURNED 
PASSPORTS TO THE SEVEN ARRESTEES, AS PROMISED, AND INDICATED 
THEY WERE FREE TO LEAVE.  GIVEN THE DAY'S FAST-MOVING EVENTS, 
HOWEVER, THEY HAD DECIDED TO FOLLOW THEIR JOURNALISTIC 
INSTINCTS AND REMAIN IN BAGHDAD.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER, EMBASSY 
ODC CHIEF RECEIVED A CALL FROM GOI MILITARY CONTACTS TO SAY 
THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO PURSUE THE PREVIOUS DAY'S REQUEST 
FOR DATA ON THE FEASIBILITY OF AN IAF C-130J LANDING AT 
BAGHDAD INTERNATIONAL TO EVACUATE THE JOURNALISTS. 
 
¶4. (C) WHILE THE ABOVE CONVERSATIONS WERE TAKING PLACE, 
ZANARDI LANDI FAXED US THE DETAILS OF ALL ITALIAN JOURNALISTS 
CURRENTLY IN IRAQ.  ALTHOUGH THE ITALIANS DESIRE TO ESCAPE 
THE FIGHTING IN BAGHDAD HAS APPARENTLY BEEN OVERTAKEN BY THE 
DAY'S EVENTS, WE REPEAT BELOW THEIR IDENTIFYING DETAILS AS 
GIVEN US BY ZANARDI LANDI IN CASE THEY MAY BE OF ANY USE TO 
CENTCOM:
