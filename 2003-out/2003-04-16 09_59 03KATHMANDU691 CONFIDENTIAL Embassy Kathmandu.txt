Classified By: AMB. MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C)  Following Ref C guidance, on April 16 poloff 
contacted known Maoist sympathizer Padma Ratna Tuladhar to 
convey Embassy agreement to meet at the First Secretary level 
with Maoist representatives.  Poloff advised Tuladhar that 
the RSO will also participate in the meeting, which has been 
tentatively scheduled for the afternoon of Friday, April 25, 
at the Embassy. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Poloff stipulated that the meeting will be 
contingent upon Maoist conduct during the upcoming strikes 
scheduled by various student unions (Ref A).  Tuladhar 
protested that the Maoists are not sponsoring the strikes and 
cannot be held accountable for them.  Poloff countered that 
the Embassy will indeed hold the Maoists responsible for the 
behavior of its affiliated student union and reminded him 
that Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai had been quoted in the 
press as saying the Maoists "support" the strikes.  She added 
that there must be no press coverage of the meeting. 
Tuladhar agreed that the appointment would be kept 
"confidential."  He promised to contact poloff with the names 
and dates of birth of the proposed participants. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Comment:  It remains to be seen whether Baburam 
Bhattarai will accept a meeting held at the more modest level 
of First Secretary, rather than Ambassador.  Tuladhar's 
dissembling notwithstanding, we expect the Maoists will 
attempt to exploit any meeting for publicity purposes.  If 
so, we will use the press guidance provided in Ref B.
