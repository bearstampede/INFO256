SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. WFP HOSTED A TWO-AND-ONE-HALF DAY CONSULTATION ON 
EMERGENCY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS (ENA) AT CASTEL GANDOLFO (NEAR 
ROME) MARCH 12-14, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF EIGHT DONORS, 
FIVE UN AGENCIES, NINE NGOS, USAID'S FAMINE EARLY WARNING 
SYSTEM NETWORK (FEWS NET), AND TWO PROMINENT REGIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS FROM SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (CILSS AND SADC). BOTH 
US MISSION AND USAID/FFP/W WERE REPRESENTED AT THE MEETING. 
THE CONSULTATION FOCUSED ON THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: A) 
IDENTIFY A MINIMUM SET OF REQUIREMENTS EXPECTED FROM 
ASSESSMENTS FOR PROGRAMMING AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION 
DECISIONS; B) INVENTORY CAPACITIES IN ENA AND STRENGTHEN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01511  01 OF 04  091003Z 
UNDERSTANDING OF AREAS AND COMPETENCIES; C) IDENTIFY 
INFORMATION LINKAGES BETWEEN NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND 
BASELINES, EARLY WARNING AND PROGRAM MONITORING AND 
EVALUATION, AND HOW THESE COULD BE BETTER FACILITATED; AND 
D) BROADEN AND STRENGTHEN ENA PARTNERSHIPS AMONG WFP AND 
OTHER ACTORS. PARTICIPANTS ARGUED FOR COMPARABILITY AND 
MINIMUM DATA SETS; ENDORSED REGIONAL AND SUB-REGIONAL 
APPROACHES TO ASSESSMENTS; AND PROMOTED APPROACHES THAT 
DISTINGUISH ACUTE FROM CHRONIC NEEDS. PARTICIPANTS ALSO 
URGED MORE DETAILED ENA ANALYSIS ON LIVELIHOODS WHILE 
RECOGNIZING DIFFICULTIES IN COMPARING LIVELIHOOD 
VULNERABILITY INDICATORS AS COUNTRIES HAVE DIFFERENT 
RISKS/ASSETS/COPING STRATEGIES. FINALLY, PARTICIPANTS 
CONCLUDED THAT SPECIFIC METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES NEEDED 
REFINEMENTS ON ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL FOR COMMERCIAL IMPORTS 
TO FILL A DOMESTIC FOOD SUPPLY GAP - ENDORSING INCREASED 
FOCUS ON HOW MARKETS CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVELY USED TO BOLSTER 
FOOD SECURITY IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. END SUMMARY. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶2. FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS, HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE HAS 
TOTALED AROUND U.S. DOLLARS 5.5 BILLION/ANNUM. WORLDWIDE, 35 
MILLION PEOPLE HAVE FLED THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF FEAR OF 
PERSECUTION OR WAR. THIS YEAR WFP EMERGENCY OPERATIONS 
(EMOPS) WILL TARGET (EXCLUDING IRAQ) 39.2 MILLION 
BENEFICIARIES, AND WILL REQUIRE AN INPUT OF ALMOST 2.4 
MILLION TONS. PROJECTED REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTRACTED RELIEF 
AND RECOVERY OPERATIONS (PRROS) WILL INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01511  01 OF 04  091003Z 
TARGETING 25 MILLION BENEFICIARIES WITH UP TO 1.6 MILLION 
TONS FOR 2003. WFP, AND BY EXTENSION THE OTHER UN 
HUMANITARIAN ACTORS, NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEIR 
EMERGENCY ASSESSMENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY CREDIBLE SO THAT ALL 
DONORS ABLE TO RESPOND WILL BE WILLING TO RESPOND. IN 
PARTICULAR, THE UN AGENCIES NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT RIGOR 
IS SYSTEMATICALLY APPLIED TO THE APPEALS PROCESS IN ORDER TO 
AVOID "INFLATING THE NUMBERS."  THERE IS A GENERAL DONOR 
BIAS (LED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION) THAT FOOD AID 
REQUIREMENTS FOR EMERGENCIES ARE INVARIABLY OVER-ESTIMATED 
WHICH, IF THE APPEALS ARE MET, COULD IMPACT NEGATIVELY ON 
LOCAL MARKETS. IT WAS NOTED THAT BECAUSE WFP EMERGENCY 
OPERATIONS (EMOPS) IN THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE FREQUENTLY 
BEEN MET WITH A 50-70 PERCENT RESPONSE, THERE APPEARS TO BE 
A TENDENCY TO SHOOT HIGH IN THE ENAS TO COMPENSATE. THIS 
PRACTICE, IN TURN, REINFORCES DONOR CONCERNS ABOUT 
CREDIBILITY.

--------------------------------- 
U.S. COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5. THE INITIATIVE TAKEN BY FAO/GLOBAL INFORMATION AND EARLY 
WARNING SYSTEM (GIEWS) TO WORK WITH WFP IN OPENING UP 
PARTICIPATION IN THE CROP AND FOOD SUPPLY ASSESSMENTS IS 
VERY WELCOME. IN THIS REGARD, THE UNITED STATES STRESSED THE 
IMPORTANCE OF FAO AND WFP ENGAGING DONORS WHEN EARLY SIGNS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01511  03 OF 04  091004Z 
OF A POTENTIAL CRISIS ARISE. IN THIS WAY DONORS CAN DIRECTLY 
RAISE ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO THEM RELATED TO METHODOLOGY, 
TIMING, PARTICIPATION IN ASSESSMENTS, ETC. IT WAS SUGGESTED 
THAT ONE PRACTICAL WAY TO OVERCOME THE PERCEPTION OF FOOD 
AID BIAS, AND POSSIBLE HARM TO LOCAL MARKETS, WAS TO ENSURE 
THAT NEEDS ANALYSES ADEQUATELY REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS 
AFFECTING BOTH THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR FOOD BY VULNERABLE 
GROUPS. IN SHORT, CONTINGENCY PLANNING INVOLVING ALL 
RELEVANT IN-COUNTRY ACTORS WILL LEAD TO EARLIER CONSENSUS 
ABOUT ACTIONS REQUIRED IN RESPONSE TO NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN 
THE ENA. AS SUCH, FEWS NET CONTINUES TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT 
ROLE IN FACILITATING ASSESSMENT PLANNING AND IN ASSISTING 
CROP AND FOOD SUPPLY ASSESSMENT MISSIONS (CFSAMS) IN THOSE 
COUNTRIES WHERE IT HAS A REPRESENTATIVE IN COUNTRY. 
 
¶6. WHERE FOOD AID IS APPROPRIATE, INTERVENTIONS NEED TO TAKE 
INTO ACCOUNT SUPPLIES OF FOOD THROUGH LOCAL MARKETS 
(EXISTING PRIVATE SECTOR SYSTEMS) AND THROUGH FOSTERING 
INCREASED PURCHASING POWER WHEREVER FEASIBLE. USING MARKETS 
TO DELIVER RELIEF ASSISTANCE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO SELF- 
SUFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY. ASSESSMENTS NEED TO CONSIDER 
WAYS OF IMPROVING THE NATIONAL CAPACITY (CONTINGENCY AND 
RESPONSE PLANNING) TO IMPORT FOOD ON TIME AND GET IT TO 
WHERE IT IS NEEDED. MOREOVER, A FOCUS ON THE NEED TO QUICKLY 
RESTORE LOCAL MARKETS TO NORMALITY NEEDS TO BE A CRITICAL 
COMPONENT OF ANY EMERGENCY NEEDS ANALYSIS. 
 
¶7. PRE AND POST SEASON TECHNICAL FORA, WHICH ALREADY EXIST 
IN SOME COUNTRIES AND REGIONS, PROVIDE FOR A VERY USEFUL 
PROCESS FOR PLANNING JOINT ASSESSMENTS AND FOR EARLY 
AGREEMENT ON PARTICIPATION AND METHODOLOGICAL ELEMENTS. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01511  03 OF 04  091004Z 
 
¶8. WHERE THERE IS A STRONG SUB-REGIONAL ORGANIZATION (E.G. 
SOUTHERN AFRICA DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) OR THE (CILSS) 
SAHEL PERMANENT INTER-STATE ANTI-DROUGHT COMMISSION), UN 
AGENCIES AND TECHNICAL NETWORKS ARE ENCOURAGED TO "DEEPEN" 
PARTNERSHIPS, FOCUSED ON FURTHER STRENGTHENING CAPACITIES OF 
REGIONAL BODIES TO DIRECTLY IMPACT ON IMPROVING FOOD 
SECURITY POLICY ENVIRONMENTS. 
 
¶9. MAJOR INDICATORS OF HEALTH STATUS THAT SHOULD RECEIVE 
PRIORITY ATTENTION IN EMERGENCIES INCLUDE THE CRUDE 
MORTALITY RATE (CMR), THE U-5 MORTALITY RATE AND THE 
NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF CHILDREN UNDER FIVE. IN EMERGENCY 
SITUATIONS, IT IS NECESSARY TO MEASURE THE NUMBER OF DEATHS 
PER DAY PER 10,000 PEOPLE. THE GOAL IS TO MAINTAIN A CMR OF 
LESS THAN 1 PER 10,000 PER DAY AND LESS THAN 2 PER 10,000 
PER DAY IN THE U-5. (THE AVERAGE MORTALITY IN DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES IS 0.5/10,000/DAY.)  MORTALITY DATA SHOULD BE 
DISAGGREGATED BY AGE AND GENDER TO DETERMINE THE NEED FOR 
TARGETED INTERVENTIONS. 
 
¶10. UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES NEED TO COMMIT THEMSELVES TO 
REVIEWING THEIR EMERGENCY AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS IN AREAS

FAO TO ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE FOOD SECURITY AND 
INFORMATION SYSTEM IN AFGHANISTAN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 
MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND THE 
MINISTRY OF RECONSTRUCTION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT. THE 
AVAILABILITY OF TIMELY PREDICTIONS OF FOOD SHORTAGES AND 
INFORMATION ABOUT AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES AND THE FOOD

ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONWIDE NUTRITION SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS 
IN DISASTER-PRONE COUNTRIES SUCH AS ETHIOPIA AND ZIMBABWE. 
WE ARE SIMPLY NOT GETTING THE "WARNING" DATA WE NEED TO 
RESPOND AS REQUIRED. 
 
¶13. ASSESSMENTS SHOULD ADDRESS GENDER AND AGE CONSIDERATIONS 
IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO, PREPARATION OF, AND DISTRIBUTION OF 
FOOD WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD. EQUAL AND APPROPRIATE FOOD 
CONSUMPTION PATTERNS SHOULD BE ENSURED IN ANY FOOD 
DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM. ESTIMATING FOOD REQUIREMENTS IN THE 
CONTEXT OF AVAILABLE FOOD, BOTH LOCALLY AND EXTERNALLY 
PROVIDED, IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AND REQUIRES LOCAL 
KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE. 
 
¶14. UN IS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO CONSISTENTLY CARRY OUT POST- 
DISTRIBUTION MONITORING. SUCH MONITORING RESULTS SHOULD BE 
DISSEMINATED TO DONORS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS TO 
THE UN. 
 
¶15. THE U.S. AGREES WITH AN OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE 
(ODI) PRELIMINARY FINDING ON "MEASURING NEEDS" THAT THERE 
ARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSESSMENTS: MONEY, TIME, HUMAN 
RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITY COSTS AND THAT WE SHOULD BE 
STRIVING TO ENSURE THE "RIGHT BALANCE" BETWEEN ASSESSMENT 
(INITIAL, CONTINUOUS) AND RESPONSE.
