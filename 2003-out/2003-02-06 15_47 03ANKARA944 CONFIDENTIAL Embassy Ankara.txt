Political Organizations, provided the GOT's response to ref B 
offer of access to U.S. smallpox and anthrax vaccines. 
Ozturk stated that the GOT would like to receive vaccines for 
30,000 persons for smallpox and 70,000 persons for anthrax. 
The GOT would dedicate vaccine for 20,000 military personnel 
for both smallpox and anthrax from these amounts, and would 
also be interested in receiving a civilian/military expert 
team to discuss the vaccines.  Ozturk also requested 
confirmation that there would be no charge to Turkey for the 
vaccines.
