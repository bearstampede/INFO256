We have been told by the Saudi Embassy in Kuwait that 
individual American citizens wishing to apply for visas 
to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia should go the Saudi 
Embassy in Kuwait during business hours and apply in 
person.  Applicants are required to complete a visa 
application form and provide passport-size photographs 
and copies of their valid passports and Kuwaiti residency 
permits.  We have been told that gratis "emergency 
transit visas" will be issued to individual applicants, 
provided they have valid travel documents. There have 
been 
no requests for assistance in obtaining Saudi visas 
 
Kuwaiti immigration reports all quiet at the main POE 
on the Saudi border this morning. There are no 
"stranded" Americans. The Consular team from Dhahran 
that was at Khafji on the Saudi side of the border to 
assist Americans left yesterday after 
we agreed their presence was no longer required. We are 
in close 
touch with Kuwait Immigration and they have our emergency 
contact numbers if any Americans do need assistance. 
 
The remaining two Amcits who had contacted the Embassy 
for departure assistance are no longer interested.  They 
have made their arrangements.  No pending cases.
