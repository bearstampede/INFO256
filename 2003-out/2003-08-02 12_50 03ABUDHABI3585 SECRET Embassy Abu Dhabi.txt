¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for 
reasons 1.5 (B & D). 
 
¶2. This is an action request.  See paragraph 5. 
 
¶3. (U) Embassy understands that the European Commission is 
heavily promoting Spain as a venue for the planned Iraq 
donors' conference and that the issue will be discussed in 
a teleconference this Tuesday. 
 
¶4. (C) In the Ambassador's meetings with key UAEG 
officials, they have raised the UAEG's strong desire to 
host a donors' conference for Iraq.  Most recently, when 
the Ambassador approached UAE Minister of State for Foreign 
Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan about hosting a 
donors' conference for Afghanistan, he asked whether the 
UAE was "going to get the Iraq donors' conference?"  When 
the Ambassador explained that there was no final decision, 
but that the odds increasingly favored Europe, he asked 
that the Embassy weigh in again to support the UAEG 
candidacy, because, in his words,  "we really need this 
gesture." 
 
¶5. (S) Comment and Action Request:  As reported in ref e, 
the Embassy believes that the USG should support the UAEG's 
candidacy as a host for the Iraq donors' conference.  The 
UAE has actively supported Iraqi humanitarian assistance 
and reconstruction efforts -- already contributing over USD 
$50 million to Iraqi reconstruction.  In addition, the UAE 
has supported coalition efforts to stabilize Iraq by, among 
other actions, lifting Bulgarian troops and equipment to 
Iraq.  In order to do this, the UAE had to charter air and 
sealift assets because its capability did not match our 
requirements for the task (ref a).  We also need to involve 
the Arab world in our reconstruction efforts in Iraq, since 
we will continue to ask it to provide financial support. 
Holding the conference in an Arab capital will give the 
donors' conference more credibility in the Arab world. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment and Action Request Continued:  More 
importantly, if an Arab country hosts the Iraq donors' 
conference, it will help to strengthen the credibility of 
the Iraq Governing Council (GC).  Presumably the GC will 
attend a donors' conference wherever the venue.  Having the 
conference in an Arab capital would give an important 
symbolic Arab stamp of approval to the GC as an interim 
body.  This would boost the GC's profile in the region and 
the USG's credibility in the region as an interim 
caretaker. We also note that the UAE has the infrastructure 
and the facilities to host a successful international 
conference. End Comment and Action Request.
