SUBJECT: EXPATRIATES TO GET ACCESS TO NATIONAL LABOR 
UNION IN THE UAE 
 
¶1. (U) Local press reported that the UAE Ministry of 
Labor and Social Affairs has drafted a law that will 
establish a national labor union which expatriates 
will have access to via their own representatives. The 
UAEG will likely enact the law in 2004, after the 
Federal Cabinet and the President approve the 
proposal. Labor Ministry Undersecretary Khaled Al- 
Khazraji remarked that, "Through this union, 
expatriate workers can carry out their activities 
through their own committees and groups covering each 
profession and area."  He added that the creation of 
the labor union was in response to a number of "global 
bodies, including the International Labour 
Organization, to create [a] suitable umbrella for the 
workers to represent themselves and express their own 
views." [Note: The draft law restricts full labor 
union membership to UAE nationals in the public and 
private sectors. End note.] 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: This is the first time UAEG 
officials have announced publicly that they will 
permit the creation of a labor union and, more 
importantly, that expatriates will have access to it 
indicating there is sufficient determination and clout 
to enact this proposal. The Filipino and Indian labor 
attaches told Econoff that since expatriates 
constitute a majority of the public and private sector 
employees, having access to a labor union will better 
protect their rights. We will continue to monitor the 
movement of the legislation and report any further 
developments. End comment.
