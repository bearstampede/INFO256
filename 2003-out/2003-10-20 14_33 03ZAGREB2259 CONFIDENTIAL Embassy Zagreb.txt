CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF A.F.GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
    ¶1.  SUMMARY:  THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT DISSOLVED ON OCTOBER 
17, THE FIRST FORMAL STEP IN A SERIES OF EVENTS WHICH WILL 
LEAD TO ELECTIONS ON NOVEMBER 23.  PRESIDENT MESIC TOOK THE 
SECOND STEP ON OCTOBER 20, WHEN HE FORMALLY SET THE DATE FOR 
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.  CROATIA'S ELECTORAL LAW REMAINS 
GENERALLY UNCHANGED SINCE THE LAST PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION IN 
JANUARY 2000, DESPITE OSCE CALLS FOR AN OVERHAUL. 
NONETHELESS, THE CONSENSUS OF ALL POLITICAL OBSERVERS AND 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTED IN CROATIA IS THAT 
THE NOVEMBER 23 POLL WILL BE GENERALLY FREE AND FAIR.  THIS 
ASSESSMENT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE LAW BUT 
ALSO A POLITICAL CULTURE WHICH OSCE ASSERTS HAS "IRREVOCABLY 
CHANGED FOR THE BETTER."  THIS TELEGRAM, TOGETHER WITH 
DESCRIPTIONS OF LEADING POLITICAL FIGURES AND OF CROATIA'S 
POLITICAL PARTIES (REFS) IS INTENDED TO SERVE AS A REFERENCE 
FOR THOSE FOLLOWING CROATIA'S ELECTION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CROATIA'S FIRST REFORM SABOR DISSOLVES 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  AFTER A FRENZY OF PASSING LAST-MINUTE LEGISLATION 
FOLLOWED BY A SERIES OF FORMAL SPEECHES OF FOND RECOLLECTION 
AND EVEN RECONCILIATION, CROATIA'S PARLIAMENT (SABOR) 
DISSOLVED ITSELF ON THE AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 17, 2003.  THE 
MOVE TOOK PLACE ACCORDING TO AN AGREEMENT MADE PUBLIC BY 
COALITION LEADERS WELL IN ADVANCE.  CROATIA'S CONSTITUTION 
REQUIRES THE PRESIDENT TO SET AN ELECTION DATE NOT MORE THAN 
60, BUT NOT LESS THAN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THE SABOR'S 
DISSOLUTION.  ON OCTOBER 20, PRESIDENT MESIC CARRIED OUT THIS 
DUTY AND ANNOUNCED THAT THE ELECTION WILL TAKE PLACE ON 
NOVEMBER 23, AS EXPECTED.  FROM THE MOMENT SPEAKER ZLATKO 
    TOMCIC GAVELED THE SABOR CLOSED ON NOVEMBER 17 UNTIL THE NEXT 
PARLIAMENT TAKES POWER, ALL OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE SABOR IS 
VESTED IN PM RACAN'S CABINET.  FEW OBSERVERS, HOWEVER, EXPECT 
THE LAME-DUCK GOVERNMENT TO MISUSE THIS AUTHORITY. 
 
ELECTION SCHEDULE NOW FIXED 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) NOW THAT PRESIDENT MESIC HAS OFFICIALLY FIRED THE 
STARTING GUN, THE REST OF CROATIA'S ELECTORAL SCHEDULE IS 
SET.  POLITICAL PARTIES (AND INDEPENDENT POLITICAL GROUPS) 
HAVE FOURTEEN DAYS TO SUBMIT THEIR LISTS OF CANDIDATES TO THE 
STATE ELECTORAL COMMISSION (SEC).  THE SEC THEN HAS 48 HOURS 
TO REVIEW THE LISTS, AND ONCE THEY ARE CERTIFIED, THE FORMAL 
CAMPAIGN BEGINS.  THE "OFFICIAL" CAMPAIGN WILL THEREFORE 
BEGIN ON NOVEMBER 5 AND WILL LAST UNTIL MIDNIGHT ON NOVEMBER 
21, WHEN "ELECTION SILENCE" RULES GO INTO EFFECT. 
 
FEW CHANGES TO CROATIA'S ELECTION LAW ... 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) CROATIA'S ELECTORAL LAW WAS CRITICIZED BY THE OSCE'S 
OFFICE FOR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS (ODIHR) 
AFTER THE JANUARY 2000 POLL.  ODIHR THEN MADE SPECIFIC 
SUGGESTIONS ON HOW THE LEGISLATION COULD BE CHANGED TO ENSURE 
A MORE PROFESSIONAL AND DEMOCRATIC CONDUCT OF ELECTIONS. 
DESPITE THE BEST INTENTIONS OF SOME OF THE SABOR'S LEADING 
CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERTS, THE LAW REMAINS ESSENTIALLY 
UNCHANGED.  WHEN CROATIA'S POLITICAL THEORISTS GAVE UP THE 
TASK OF ELECTION LAW OVERHAUL IN EARLY 2003, POLITICAL 
REALISTS TOOK OVER; TWO CHANGES -- ONE COSMETIC AND ONE 
    SIGNIFICANT -- TO THE EXISTING LAW WERE PASSED.  THESE 
MODIFICATIONS TOOK CHANGES TO THE STRUCTURE OF CROATIA'S 
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH INTO ACCOUNT (THE PARLIAMENT'S IRRELEVANT 
UPPER HOUSE WAS ABOLISHED IN 2001) AND -- MORE IMPORTANTLY -- 
WHEN THE NEW CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES WAS 
PASSED, INCREASING THE NUMBER OF GUARANTEED SEATS TO 
REPRESENTATIVES OF CROATIA'S MANY ETHNIC MINORITY WAS 
INCREASED FROM THREE TO EIGHT. 
 
... BUT "FREE AND FAIR" POLL EXPECTED 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) DESPITE THE GOC'S FAILURE TO CHANGE THE ELECTION LAW, 
ODIHR EXPERTS HAVE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT THEY TERMED 
A "SEA CHANGE" IN THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN CROATIA.  AN 
ODIHR EXPERT TEAM WHICH VISITED ZAGREB FROM SEPTEMBER 16 - 19 
CITED CONFIDENCE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS BY ALL RELEVANT 
OBSERVERS AND RECOMMENDED THAT NO SHORT-TERM OBSERVERS BE 
DEPLOYED TO CROATIA TO OBSERVE THE POLL ON ELECTION DAY. 
 
"AD HOC" STATE ELECTORAL COMMISSION 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) CROATIA LACKS A PERMANENT STATE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION, A FAILING WHICH ODIHR CRITICIZED IN 2000 AND

"AD HOC" STATE ELECTORAL COMMISSION 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) CROATIA LACKS A PERMANENT STATE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION, A FAILING WHICH ODIHR CRITICIZED IN 2000 AND 
 
 

 
ZAGREB 00002259  002.1 OF 003 
 
TANDS UP" FOR EACH 
ELECTION.  CHAIRED BY THE PRESIDENT OF CROATIA'S SUPREME 
COURT, THE ELEVEN-MEMBER SEC IS MADE UP OF LEADING 
NON-PARTISAN JURISTS.  FOUR WILL BE NAMED TO THE SEC BY THE 
    CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, THE OTHER SIX ARE NAMED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION PARTIES.  DESPITE ITS AD HOC 
NATURE, THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE SEC IS STABLE. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) UNTIL IT CERTIFIES THE RESULTS OF THE NOVEMBER 23 
ELECTION, THE SEC HAS NEARLY ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY IN CONDUCTING 
THE POLL, SETTING RULES AND APPOINTING LOWER-LEVEL ELECTION 
OFFICIALS.  ONE OF THE SEC'S FIRST TASKS WILL BE TO PUBLISH 
THE "MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS" FOR THE ELECTION.  THE SEC MUST 
ALSO APPOINT DISTRICT ELECTORAL COMMISSIONS WHICH IN TURN 
NAME THE ELECTORAL BOARD MEMBERS FOR EACH POLLING PLACE.  THE 
SEC DIRECTLY APPOINTS ELECTORAL BOARD MEMBERS FOR POLLING 
PLACES OUTSIDE OF CROATIA. 
 
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS THE LAST WORD 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) AN ETHICS COMMISSION APPOINTED BY CROATIA'S 
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT (FROM NOMINEES OF GOVERNMENT AND 
OPPOSITION PARTIES) OVERSEES THE CAMPAIGN AND THE ELECTION 
PROCESS.  THE PRESIDENT OF THE CROATIAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND 
SCIENCES CHAIRS THE COMMISSION AS A SEVENTH MEMBER.  THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT SERVES AS THE FINAL ARBITER FOR APPEALS 
OF DECISIONS MADE BY ELECTORAL COMMISSIONS. 
 
TEN GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRICTS, 14 SEATS EACH, PLUS ... 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶9.  (SBU) THE NUMBER OF MP'S IN THE CROATIAN SABOR IS NOT 
FIXED; THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THE SABOR MUST HAVE FROM 100 
TO 160 REPRESENTATIVES.  CROATIA IS DIVIDED INTO TEN 
    ELECTORAL DISTRICTS OF APPROXIMATE EQUAL POPULATION SIZE. 
EACH DISTRICT ELECTS 14 MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.  SEATS ARE 
AWARDED TO PARTIES OR INDEPENDENT LISTS OF CANDIDATES WHICH 
BREAK THE FIVE-PERCENT MINIMUM VOTE THRESHOLD IN THEIR 
DISTRICT BASED ON THE D'HONDT METHOD.  (POLITICAL JUNKIES 
SEEKING A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THIS METHOD MAY CHOOSE TO 
GO TO WWW.IFES.ORG.) 
 
"DIASPORA" VOTE WILL BE CONTROVERSIAL 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶10.  (C) ALL CROATIAN CITIZENS OUTSIDE OF CROATIA HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO VOTE IN A SEPARATE DISTRICT, BUT THE NUMBER OF MP'S 
ELECTED FROM THE 11TH OR "DIASPORA" DISTRICT IS NOT FIXED. 
TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF DIASPORA MP'S, THE SEC DIVIDES THE 
TOTAL NUMBER OF VOTES CAST ABROAD BY THE AVERAGE NUMBER 
NEEDED TO WIN A MANDATE INSIDE OF CROATIA.  THE MOST RECENT 
SABOR HAD SIX DIASPORA MP'S -- ALL HDZ -- WHO WON THEIR SEATS 
BASED ON A MASSIVE TURNOUT OF RIGHT-WING BOSNIAN CROAT 
VOTERS.  CHANGES IN REGULATIONS -- APPROVED BY THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT -- STIPULATE THAT VOTING ABROAD CAN ONLY 
TAKE PLACE IN CROATIA'S DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR MISSIONS. 
THIS MAY PLACE PHYSICAL LIMITS ON THE NUMBER OF BOSNIAN 
CROATS ABLE TO VOTE SINCE THERE WILL BE ONLY FOUR POLLING 
PLACES IN BIH (THE CROATIAN EMBASSY IN SARAJEVO AND 
CONSULATES GENERAL IN MOSTAR, TUZLA AND BANJA LUKA).  IN THE 
JANUARY 2000 ELECTION THERE WERE MORE POLLING PLACES IN BIH; 
THE HDZ GOVERNMENT BENT EVERY RULE TO ENSURE EVERY BOSNIAN 
CROAT HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE. 
 
¶11.  (C) ODIHR EXPERTS HAVE SIGNALED THAT THEY WILL WATCH 
    DIASPORA VOTING CLOSELY.  THEY WILL LIKELY CRITICIZE ANY GOC 
EFFORTS TO USE ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES (LIKE LIMITING THE 
NUMBER OF POLLING PLACES) WHICH WOULD RESTRICT THE RIGHT OF 
CROATIANS ABROAD TO EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO 
VOTE.  GOC LEADERS HAVE REJECTED THIS CRITICISM; THEY POINT 
TO A PROVISION IN THE ELECTORAL LAW WHICH ALLOWS POLLING 
PLACES OUTSIDE OF CROATIA TO REMAIN OPEN FOR TWO DAYS AS 
SUFFICIENT TIME FOR ELIGIBLE VOTERS IN BIH TO GET TO THE 
POLLS. 
 
GREATER GUARANTEED MINORITY REPRESENTATION 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶12.  (SBU) RESPONDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE TO ASSURE 
CROATIA'S MINORITIES WERE GIVEN A GREATER VOICE IN 
PARLIAMENT, THE RACAN GOVERNMENT PASSED THE LANDMARK 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON NATIONAL MINORITIES (CLNM) IN DECEMBER 
¶2002.  THIS LAW, WIDELY PRAISED BY THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY, INCREASED THE NUMBER OF SEATS RESERVED FOR 
CROATIA'S ETHNIC MINORITIES FROM FIVE TO EIGHT; THE SERB 
MINORITY WILL BE GUARANTEED THREE SEATS.  MINORITY VOTERS 
MUST CHOOSE WHETHER TO VOTE AS MINORITIES OR AS RESIDENTS IN 
ONE OF THE TEN GEOGRAPHICAL ELECTORAL DISTRICTS.  MINORITY 
REPRESENTATIVES OBJECTED TO BEING FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN 
THE MINORITY OR "REGULAR" LISTS AND APPEALED TO THE

BLOCK OF PRIME TIME ON THE STATE-OWNED TV CHANNEL AND 15 
MINUTES OF PRIME TIME ON EVERY CHANNEL WHICH HAS BEEN GRANTED
