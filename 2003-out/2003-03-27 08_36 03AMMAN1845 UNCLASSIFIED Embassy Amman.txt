DEPARTMENT FOR STATE FOR CA/VO/L/C FROM THE AMBASSADOR 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: CVIS JO AL ALAMI NADIA
SUBJECT: VISAS ADVISORY OPINIONS: SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA FOR 
FSN NADIA AL ALAMI 
 
¶1.  I SUBMIT FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION A NOMINATION FOR A 
SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA (SIV) FOR SENIOR CULTURAL SPECIALIST 
NADIA AL ALAMI AND HER FAMILY.  I CONCUR WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH 
THE UNANIMOUS RECOMMENDATION FROM EMBASSY AMMAN'S SIV PRE- 
SCREENING PANEL THAT NADIA AL ALAMI DESERVES THIS STATUS IN 
THAT SHE HAS FAITHFULLY SERVED THE USG IN AN OUTSTANDING 
MANNER, ACHIEVING UNUSUAL PROMINENCE AND EXERCISING AN 
EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DEDICATION 
TOWARDS USG OBJECTIVES. 
 
¶2.  NADIA HAS ACHIEVED A HIGH LEVEL OF VISIBILITY IN HER 
CAPACITY AS CULTURAL SPECIALIST, ONE OF THE MAIN CRITERIA 
FOR THE SIV.  AS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PRE-SCREENING PANEL 
WITH LONG EXPERIENCE AT THIS POST CONFIRMED, SHE IS A WELL- 
KNOWN AND RESPECTED INTERLOCUTOR TO THE JORDANIAN 
LEADERSHIP.  FROM MINISTERS TO UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS, OUR 
TOP JORDANIAN CONTACTS KNOW AND ADMIRE NADIA'S OUTSTANDING 
CREATIVITY, ENERGY AND ORGANIZING ABILITY.  HER SUPERVISORS 
REPORT THAT OVER THE YEARS SHE HAS OFTEN PERSUADED RELUCTANT 
JORDANIAN OFFICIALS TO PARTICIPATE IN OR SANCTION KEY 
MISSION PROGRAMS, FOR EXAMPLE IN THE AREAS OF CIVIC 
EDUCATION AND JUDICIAL REFORM.  SHE IS WITHOUT QUESTION ONE 
OF THE BEST-KNOWN PRACTITIONERS OF PUBLIC RELATIONS IN 
AMMAN, AMONG INFORMATION AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS, 
ACADEMIA, NGO'S AND OTHER KEY INSTITUTIONS. 
 
¶3.  OVER HER CAREER, NADIA HAS RISEN TO A POSITION OF 
EXTENSIVE CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MISSION'S 
CULTURAL ACTIVITIES, ANOTHER CRITERION FOR SIV.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, SHE MANAGED ALL OF THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS SPEAKER, 
CITIZEN EXCHANGE AND OTHER CULTURAL PROGRAMMING IN THE 
ABSENCE OF ANY AMERICAN OFFICERS IN THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS 
SECTION DURING THE 1990-91 GULF WAR.  RECENTLY, SHE MANAGED 
CULTURAL PROGRAMS IN THE ABSENCE OF A CULTURAL AFFAIRS 
OFFICER FROM JANUARY THROUGH AUGUST 2002.  IN THIS CAPACITY, 
SHE NEGOTIATED MAJOR LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS WITH JORDANIAN 
INSTITUTIONS AND AMERICAN NGOS FUNDED BY PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND 
USAID FUNDS. SHE SHOWED A STRONG SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND 
DEDICATION IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS, SAVING THE USG SIGNIFICANT 
AMOUNTS OF MONEY. 
 
¶4.  IN ADDITION TO CONSISTENTLY OUTSTANDING EVALUATIONS, 
NADIA HAS ALSO EARNED SEVERAL MERITORIOUS HONOR AWARDS AND 
THE RUNNER-UP POSITION TO THE USIS FSN OF THE YEAR. 
HER APPLICATION IS EXTREMELY WELL DOCUMENTED AND INCLUDES 
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A FORMER AMBASSADOR, WHO CALLED NADIA A 
"COURAGEOUS" FSN WHO IS NOT AFRAID TO DELIVER "TOUGH 
MESSAGES" ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES. 
 
¶5. NADIA HAS INDICATED A STRONG DESIRE TO IMMIGRATE TO THE 
UNITED STATES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO COMMENCE A NEW CAREER 
THERE.  HER FAMILY WOULD ACCOMPANY HER: ADNAN ODEH (SPOUSE), 
AUGUST 21, 1958, ZAID ODEH (SON), JANUARY 20, 1993, RAMI 
ODEH (SON), AUGUST 25, 1997.  ALL ARE FROM JORDAN. 
 
¶6.  I BELIEVE THAT IT IS IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST TO GRANT 
MS. AL ALAMI AND HER FAMILY SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA STATUS. 
NADIA AL ALAMI HAS MET ALL THE CRITERIA NECESSARY UNDER THE 
REGULATIONS AND HAS MY PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION.  I EXPECT 
THAT SHE AND HER FAMILY WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE POSITIVE 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR NATION IF THEY ARE ALLOWED TO LIVE 
WITHIN OUR COUNTRY.
