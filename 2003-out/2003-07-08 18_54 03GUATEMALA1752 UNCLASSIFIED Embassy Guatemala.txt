Â¶1.  In the absence of more senior officials, PolOff conveyed 
the Spanish version of reftel points to Marco Tulio Chicas, 
Deputy Director for Multilateral Affairs on July 2 and 
followed up on July 7.  Chicas said our points had been 
instrumental in preparing a briefing for his superiors, but 
that they had not yet reviewed the material or formed a 
position.  Chicas promised to inform us of the official 
Guatemalan position on the issue of cloning as soon as it is 
decided.
