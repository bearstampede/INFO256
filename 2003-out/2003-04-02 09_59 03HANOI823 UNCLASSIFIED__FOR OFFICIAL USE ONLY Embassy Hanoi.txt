Dear Mr. Spooner, 
 
As specified in our note dated March 24, 2003 sent to the 
U.S. Embassy in Hanoi that Vietnam would produce its counter- 
proposal one week before the commencing date of 
negotiations, I hereby forward to you Vietnam's proposal on 
Annex B.  Our drafted text shall be handed over to the U.S. 
side during our talks in Washington. 
 
I hope that we will have productive and constructive 
discussions next week toward the completion of a mutually 
satisfactory deal. 
 
I am looking forward to working with you. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
(signed) 
Nguyen Thanh Bien 
Chief Negotiator
