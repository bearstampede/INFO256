  ¶1.   Under headline "U. S. has a role to play in solving 
      Zimbabwe crisis" the July 10 edition of the 
      independent daily "The Daily News" carried the 
      following op-ed by Marko Phiri, political 
      commentator, in which he advocates for a United 
      States involvement in resolving the political, 
      economic and social turmoil in Zimbabwe.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .For Zimbabwe, the role of America in censuring 
      rogue regimes is apparently 
      well-appreciated. . .What is interesting about the 
      Zimbabwe crisis is that it has reportedly divided 
      Pretoria and Washington, with Bush telling Thabo 
      Mbeki what he ought to do with his neighbor, who has 
      turned out to be a poor student of democracy.  As 
      reported, Mbeki is not too ready to be told what to 
      do or have his foreign policy defined for him by 
      American hegemonic interests."
