SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON ARTICLE 98, JUNE 9, 2003 
 
 
Â¶1.  Regular columnist Ramon Villeda Bermudez on liberal daily 
"La  Tribuna", Tegucigalpa based 6/7 entitled: "International 
Disgrace". "The Government of Honduras has committed  one  of 
the   most   degrading  acts  by  approving  a  "dishonorable 
agreement"  with  the  United  States  (Article   98).   This 
agreement prohibits both countries from turning over  to  the 
International  Criminal Court (ICC)  any  citizen  from  both 
countries  that  is  accused  of  genocide,  crimes   against 
humanity or war crimes. This degrading act violates the  Rome 
Statute of the ICC, which had been approved unanimously by  a 
past legislature." 
 
"The  manner  in which this agreement was approved  was  also 
irregular.  First  at  all, the bill  was  submitted  to  the 
National  Congress past-midnight during the final session  of 
the  legislature, after the agreement was kept in secret  for 
more  than eight months since President Maduro signed  it  on 
September 2002. Furthermore, this agreement was approved by a 
simple   majority  of  deputies  of  the  National  Congress, 
violating  a  Constitutional clause that states that  a  two- 
thirds  majority  in Congress must approve all  international 
agreements." 
 
"A  significant segment of deputies and other  social  groups 
have  condemned this decision, which makes clear  the  scarce 
self-esteem and sovereignty of Honduras. It is time  to  show 
our gratitude to the global superpowers with more dignity."
