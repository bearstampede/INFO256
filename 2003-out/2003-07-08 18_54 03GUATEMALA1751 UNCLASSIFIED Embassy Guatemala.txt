RESOLUTION AT ECOSOC 
 
REF: STATE 192000 
 
PolOff discussed reftel points with Deputy Director for 
Multilateral Affairs, Marco Tulio Chicas, on July 7.  Chicas 
was familiar with the perennial nature of the resolution, and 
expressed hope that this year's resolution will not be a 
one-sided condemnation of Israel as in years past.  Guatemala 
believes this year's resolution may be more balanced 
according to Chicas.  Chicas said Guatemala would have to 
wait for the actual text of the resolution before taking a 
position.
