REF: ABU DHABI 1437 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright for Reasons 1.5 
(B) and (D). 
 
---------------- 
General Overview 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) COM convened Abu Dhabi's Iraq Task Force/Core 
Emergency Action Committee (EAC) at 1000 local time, Wednesday 
3/26.  Embassy Abu Dhabi, FCS (located outside of the Embassy 
compound), and the USGS office in Al Ain are open 3/26 with full 
staffing. 
 
--------------- 
Consular Issues 
--------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) The consular section is open for visa services and 
American Citizen Services.  The American community remains calm; 
CONS has not received calls from worried AMCITs. 
 
¶4.  (C) CONS proposed and Task Force approved, issuance of a 
warden update to alert Americans in the UAE that there have been 
minor disruptions in air traffic in and out of the UAE.  The 
message, in an effort to counteract rumors, also informs that 
there have been no hostile actions against Americans or U.S. 
interests in the UAE.  The message urges Americans to remain 
vigilant. 
 
¶5.  (U) American business community contacts continue to report 
that private American citizens and U.S. companies located here 
have not departed the UAE on a large scale.  RSO reported that 
the Abu Dhabi Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) 
continues to meet on a daily basis.

DUBAI TELETHON RAISES $13 MILLION FOR IRAQI HUMANITARIAN RELIEF 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------ 
 
¶6.  (SBU) ECON noted that the 12-hour telethon conducted 
yesterday on Dubai TV and radio raised DHS 49 million ($13.3 
million) for humanitarian relief in Iraq.  Sponsored by Dubai 
Crown Prince Muhammad bin Rashid Al-Maktoum's Charitable and 
Humanitarian Foundation, the telethon featured appearances by 
local and Arab notables, including outspoken Dubai Police Chief 
General Dhahi Khalfan, who sharply criticized coalition military 
actions in Iraq and called on the American and British 
Ambassadors to the UAE to "honestly report to their governments 
the strong anti-war sentiments of the public."  Also making 
appearances were an Iraqi Sunni cleric, Shaykh Ahmed Al-Qubaisi, 
and "Raghda," a Syrian actress well-known for her close ties to 
the Iraqi regime (many in the Iraqi expat community here claim 
she is one of several Arab entertainers on Saddam's payroll). 
Al-Qubaisi called on Arabs to rise up against the 
American/British "ijtiyah" (invasion) and at one point, 
collapsed into tears, predicting that the U.S. is "redrawing the 
map of the Arab world with Iraqi blood."  (Comment:  This 
telethon, like the emotionally-charged one held in April 2002 
during the Israeli incursion into Jenin, is seen by the 
leadership as an effective tool for containing public anger and 
frustration.  End Comment.) 
 
¶7. (C) ECON also reported that hawala remittances to Iraq from 
UAE residents had stopped due to difficulties in transferring 
money since the onset of hostilities. 
 
 
 
-------- 
Security 
-------- 
 
¶8.  (C) Currently on spring break vacation, the American 
Community School will resume classes on Saturday 3/29.  The RSO 
reported that the buses used for ferrying Embassy children will 
not be used for four days after class resumption as a 
precautionary measure.  On the fifth day, the buses will be 
used, but will be switched on a regular basis to alter busing 
patterns. 
 
¶9.  (C) RSO reported that on 3/25, two journalists from the 
country of Georgia were questioned by local police after they 
attempted to photograph the Embassy compound.  The RSO informed 
the journalists that photographs of the Embassy were not 
permitted and referred them to the UAE Ministry of Information. 
¶10.  (S/NF) ORCA reported that there continue to be reports of a 
possible chemical attack on Americans or U.S. interests 
worldwide.  Although reporting specific to the Gulf continues, 
there have been no threat reports specific to the UAE. 
 
----------- 
Local Media 
----------- 
 
¶11.  (U) PAO reported that Abu Dhabi TV will feature a live 
interview with Secretary Powell this evening conducted by 
correspondents from Abu Dhabi TV, Al-Jazeera and Egyptian 
Satellite TV. 
 
¶12.  (C) PAO indicated that, with the exception of Abu Dhabi 
government-owned Al-Ittihad, the local Arabic papers are not 
balanced in their reporting on the war.  PAO will engage with 
the press to encourage more balanced coverage. 
 
¶13.  (U) Abu Dhabi Iraq Task Force/EAC will reconvene at 
1000 local time, Saturday 3/29. 
 
¶14.  (U) Iraq Task Force/EAC members in attendance included 
AMB, DCM, RSO, DAO, P/M, POL, ECON, CONS, MSG, PAO, 
ADMIN, and USLO.
