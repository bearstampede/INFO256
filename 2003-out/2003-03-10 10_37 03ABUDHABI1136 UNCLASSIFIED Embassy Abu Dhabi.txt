SUBJECT:  PROPOSAL FOR UAE MEDIA TRAINING WORKSHOP 
 
REF:  AMMAN 938 
 
¶1.  PROGRAM REQUEST:  PAS ABU DHABI REQUESTS ASSISTANCE 
TO RECRUIT VETERAN JOURNALIST GIL BUTLER FOR A MEDIA 
TRAINING WORKSHOP WITH UAE JOURNALISTS FOR EARLY MAY 
¶2003.  SIMILAR TO A RECENT MEDIA TRAINING WORKSHOP IN 
AMMAN, PAS ABU DHABI REQUESTS MR. BUTLER CONDUCT TWO 
FIVE-DAY WORKSHOPS FOR GROUPS OF 25 UAE JOURNALISTS, ONE 
IN DUBAI, THE SECOND IN ABU DHABI.  EACH TRAINING 
SESSION SHOULD INCLUDE FOCUS ON IMPROVING JOURNALISTS' 
REPORTING SKILLS, PARTICULARLY ON EDITORIAL AND OPINION 
WRITING, NEWS LEAD AND FEATURE WRITING, INVESTIGATIVE 
REPORTING, AND USE OF INTERNET RESOURCES FOR MEDIA 
RESEARCH. 
 
¶2.  GIVEN THE INCREASING HOSTILITY OF LOCAL AND REGIONAL 
MEDIA TO USG POLICIES, THIS WORKSHOP AIMS TO ENCOURAGE A 
MORE PROFESSIONAL MEDIA AND FOSTER LONG-TERM DIALOGUE ON 
USG POLICIES.  TO INCREASE THE LONG-TERM BENEFITS OF THE 
TRAINING, PARTICANTS WILL CONSIST OF MID-CAREER AND 
JUNIOR JOURNALISTS FROM LOCAL AND REGIONAL PRINT MEDIA. 
WHILE LARGELY ARAB EXPATRIATES WITH YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, 
THE MAJORITY OF THESE JOURNALISTS OPERATE WITH LITTLE OR 
NO FORMAL TRAINING.  ALTHOUGH THE UAE GOVERNMENT AND 
MEDIA ACTIVELY SUPPORT ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR 
JOURNALISTS, MOST WORKSHOPS AND SEMINARS IN THE REGION 
DO NOT PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY TRAINING. 
 
¶3.  THE EMIRATES NEWS AGENCY (WAM) HAS AGREED TO SPONSOR 
THE PROPOSED TRAINING WORKSHOPS IF MR. BUTLER AGREES TO 
CONDUCT THE WORKSHOPS.  WAM AGREES TO PROVIDE MR. BUTLER 
LODGING, MEALS, AND DOMESTIC TRANSPORTATION AND 
TRANSLATION SERVICES FOR WORKSHOP LEADERS AND MEDIA 
PARTICIPANTS. 
 
¶4.  PAS ABU DHABI WELCOMES ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MEDIA 
TRAINERS IF MR. BUTLER IS NOT AVAILABLE.  FOR POSSIBLE 
ALTERNATE CANDIDATES, PAS ABU DHABI REQUESTS A 
PROFESSIONAL WITH RECENT WORK EXPERIENCE IN ARABIC MEDIA 
AND THE MIDDLE EAST. 
 
¶5.  TIME FRAME:  ON OR ABOUT MAY 3-14, 2003. 
 
¶6.  MPP OBJECTIVE AND AUDIENCE REACHED:  SUPPORTING THE 
MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE THEME OF ENCOURAGING 
A MORE PROFESSIONAL AND INDEPENDENT MEDIA BY ENHANCING 
THE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE OF JUNIOR AND MID-CAREER 
JOURNALISTS IN THE UAE.
