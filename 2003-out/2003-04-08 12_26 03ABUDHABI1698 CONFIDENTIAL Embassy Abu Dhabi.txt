SUBJECT:  ICC ARTICLE 98:  UAE CONSIDERING 
EXCHANGE OF DIP NOTES 
 
REF:  Abu Dhabi 415 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) The Ambassador used the opportunity of an 
April 6 meeting with MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan bin 
Zayid Al-Nahyan to again urge forward movement on 
the signing of an ICC Article 98 agreement.  Hamdan 
acknowledged the importance of dealing with this 
issue, which had been on the agenda of last year's 
inaugural Bilateral Strategic Dialogue.  The 
Ambassador laid out the option of formalizing the 
agreement via an exchange of diplomatic notes, but 
emphasized that this would need to be legally 
binding.  Hamdan promised to look into the matter 
right away. 
 
¶3. (C) MFA Deputy Legal Affairs Director Yacoub Al- 
Hosani contacted Polchief on April 7 to report that 
Hamdan had decided to pursue an exchange of dip 
notes.  He assured that this course of action would 
be legally binding.  Polchief faxed over the dip 
note draft language in Arabic and English provided 
by the Department.  Al-Hosani briefed that a 
committee has been formed to review the language; he 
estimated that the UAE would need approximately 
three to four weeks for the review process.  We will 
continue to follow-up with the MFA and report our 
findings to the Department.
