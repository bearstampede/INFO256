¶1. On December 7 Polchief and Poloff delivered ref. A 
points on Human Cloning to the MFA Director of the 
European, American and Oceanic Affairs Department, 
Ambassador Ahmed Al-Muqarrab.  Al-Muqarrab agreed to pass 
the information to the International Organizations 
Department Director, who would review the UAE position and 
make a recommendation to the UAE PermRep in New York. 
 
¶2. The MFA America's Desk confirmed the UAE's support for 
the USG position on banning all forms of human cloning, as 
well as its support for the Costa Rican resolution. 
However, the UAEG voted in favor of the Iranian 
delegation's deferral motion last month, along with the 
rest of the OIC.  Unless there is a break in the OIC 
consensus on the deferral, it is unlikely that the UAE will 
change its position.  The UAEG stated before the November 
vote that, if there was division within the OIC, it would 
consider abstaining, in coordination with the GCC (ref. E).
