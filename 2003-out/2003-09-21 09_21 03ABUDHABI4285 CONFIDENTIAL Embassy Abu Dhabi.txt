SUBJECT:  SHAYKH HAMDAN:  TIME FOR ISRAELIS TO SUPPORT U.S. 
INTERESTS IN THE REGION 
 
(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, for reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) Summary:  Minister of State Hamdan bin Zayed told the 
Ambassador that the recent U.S. veto of UNSC resolution and 
the Israeli cabinet decision to expel Arafat has hurt USG 
interests and credibility in the region.  He commiserated 
over the loss of Abu Mazen, who was totally undermined by 
Arafat and added that Arafat and Sharon seem to be helping 
each other achieve their own goals that are not in the 
interests of either nation.  Hamdan informed the Ambassador 
that Abu Mazen sent his son to the UAE to request UAE 
citizenship for the whole family because they no longer 
feel safe in the West Bank.  The request would be 
considered by President Zayed who returns to the UAE today. 
On Ahmed Qurei, Hamdan said he is not someone they know 
well and the UAE is unsure of his ability to work 
independently of Arafat.  End Summary 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Israeli Cabinet Decision and Veto harm U.S. interests 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶1. (C) In a meeting with the Ambassador on Sep 20, 2003, 
Min of State for Foreign Affairs and Presidential son, 
Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayed (HBZ), told the Ambassador that the 
US veto of the UN resolution regarding Israel's decision to 
expel Arafat came as a surprise to the UAE given our 
position against his expulsion.  The U.S. is constantly 
supporting and protecting Israeli interests, he said and 
commented that it is time for the Israelis to support U.S. 
in the region.  This is a critical time for America and its 
image in this part of the world and the Israelis should be 
more sensitive to the current situation in Iraq and help 
rather than hurt America's image and credibility, Hamdan 
told the Ambassador.  He added that Sharon and Arafat seem 
to be supporting one another's personal ideological goals 
that will continue to undermine the long-term prospects for 
peace and hurt not only their own people but, the region as 
a whole. 
 
¶2. (C) The Ambassador briefed HBZ on the U.S. position and 
our concerns regarding the lack of balance in the 
resolution's text that made absolutely no reference to 
condemning terrorism and the organizations responsible for 
it such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Al Aqsa Martyr's 
brigade.  The Syrians and the Palestinians had not made a 
good faith effort to reach a compromise that we could have 
lived with, she argued, given our publicly stated position 
against the expulsion of Arafat.  HBZ readily agreed that 
the Syrian role has been far from constructive by pushing 
for the resolution to begin with, but argued that the 
Israeli cabinet decision should never have happened.  He 
said the Israeli decision to publicly call for either 
killing him or expelling him has made Arafat a hero and the 
US veto also has raised his stature in the region.  The two 
events combined have damaged US credibility at a critical 
time. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Abu Mazen and Family seek UAE Citizenship 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (C) Shaykh Hamdan then briefed the Ambassador about a 
recent visit to the UAE by Mahmoud Abbas's son seeking UAE 
citizenship for the family.  He said Abu Mazen is worried 
about their safety given the accusations and rumors spread 
by Arafat and his circle against him and members of the 
family.  Hamdan said the request would be considered by 
President Zayed, who returns to the UAE 9/21 after a long 
leave in Europe. 
 
--------------------- 
On new Palestinian PM 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) On the new Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei, Hamdan said 
he is not a well known entity with the UAE.  The UAE hopes 
Qurei will have the strength to manage Arafat, but from his 
recent public pronouncements that is not clear to us he 
said. 
 
(C) COMMENT:  Shaykh Hamdan recently returned from leave in 
Morocco with his family.  Like other UAE officials this 
week, he seemed to be consumed with issues or concerns 
surrounding the IMF/World Bank meetings in Dubai and less 
focused on regional or international events.   That said, 
Shaykh Hamdan made a point of highlighting their concerns 
over the deteriorating situation in the West Bank/Gaza and 
Israel.
