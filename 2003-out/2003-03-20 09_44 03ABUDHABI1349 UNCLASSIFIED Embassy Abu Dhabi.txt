SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION AND PUBLIC OPINION:  WAR AGAINST IRAQ 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  THE INITIATION OF MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ 
ENVELOPED PRINT AND SATELLITE TV COVERAGE IN THE UAE MEDIA.  ABU 
DHABI TV IS REPORTING THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS LIVE FROM BAGHDAD, 
WASHINGTON, AND OTHER PLACES IN THE REGION.  ABU DHABI TV ALSO 
CARRIED LIVE SADDAM HUSSEIN'S MARCH 20TH SPEECH AND PRESIDENT 
BUSH'S MARCH 19TH ADDRESS TO THE NATION EXPLAINING THE ONSET OF 
MILITARY ACTION.  AN "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL NOTES THAT IRAQ IS 
ONLY THE BEGINNING AND OTHER ARAB CAPITALS WILL FOLLOW. 
MEANWHILE, AN "AKHBAR AL-ARAB" EDITORIAL BLAMES SADDAM FOR THE 
SUFFERING OF IRAQIS AND THE WAR.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  UNDER THE HEADLINE 'A ROAD MAP IS PENETRATING ARAB CAPITALS," 
SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL-KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/20: 
 
"THE QUESTION NOW IS NOT WHETHER OR NOT THE WAR WILL START, BUT 
WHAT COMES AFTER IT AND HOW LONG WILL .S. TROOPS STAY IN IRAQ? 
THE MOST DANGEROUS QUESTION IS THE LEVEL OF COORDINATION BETWEEN 
WASHINGTON AND TEL AVIV IN DRAWING NEW GEOPOLITICAL MAPS AND 
RESHAPING THE FUTURE OF THE REGION.  IT HAS BECOME KNOWN THAT 
ONCE U.S. TROOPS ENTER IRAQ THEY WILL NOT DEPART, WHICH HAS BEEN 
CONFIRMED BY NUMEROUS AMERICAN OFFICIALS UNDER THE PRETEXT OF 
CEMENTING PEACE AND STABILITY, THE ELIMINATION OF WMD, AND 
CURTAILING ANY ETHNIC DISPUTES ... IRAQ WILL ONLY BE THE STARTING 
POINT TO RE-MAPPING THE MIDDLE EAST, AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT 
ISRAEL WILL PLAY A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN THIS ... STATEMENTS OF 
AMERICAN OFFICIALS CLARIFY THAT THE WAR AGAINST IRAQ IS ONLY THE 
FIRST STEP.  THE LIST OF NATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS WHICH THE U.S. 
INSISTS ON LABELING AS 'TERRORISTS' IS EXTREMELY LONG, EXCEPT FOR 
ISRAEL.  THEREFORE, THE AMERICAN MILITARY PRESENCE WAS NOT MEANT 
TO 'LIBERATE' IRAQIS, BUT TO ACHIEVE A NEW AMERICAN STRATEGY IN 
THE REGION..." 
 
¶3.  ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL-ARAB" 3/20 
EDITORIALIZED: 
 
"...THE U.S. AND A HANDFUL OF ITS ALLIES INSIST ON DECLARING WAR 
IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS, WHILE ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE REGIME IN 
IRAQ REJECTS SHOULDERING ITS HISTORICAL RESPONSIBILITY BEFORE GOD 
AND THE ENTIRE NATION AND INSISTS ON RETAINING POWER UNTIL THE 
LAST IRAQI CITIZEN ... WE HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WE ARE FACING A 
VICIOUS POWER WHICH HAS ITS OWN AGENDA ... AND THE RIGHT THING TO 
DO IN SUCH A SITUATION IS TO SAVE WHAT CAN BE SAVED AND NOT 
SACRIFICE THE NATION FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW INDIVIDUALS, 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY THEMSELVES HAVE PROVIDED A JUSTIFICATION FOR 
AN UNPRECEDENTED INTERVENTION IN THE REGION'S AFFAIRS ..." 
 
PUBLIC OPINION READ-OUT 
 
¶4.  THE GENERAL MOOD IN THE UAE IS SIMILAR TO THAT ELSEWHERE IN 
THE REGION.  MANY EXPRESS FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION AND DEEP 
SADNESS ABOUT WHAT THEY VIEW AS A TRAGIC ENDING TO THE CRISIS. 
MOST OF POST'S INTERLOCUTORS ARE CONVINCED THAT WAR HAS BECOME 
INEVITABLE AS A RESULT OF SADDAM HUSSEIN'S STUBBORNNESS AND 
REFUSAL TO STEP DOWN TO AVERT A DESTRUCTIVE WAR AGAINST IRAQ. 
THIS BELIEF IS VERY STRONG IN THE UAE AND REFLECTS THE OFFICIAL 
LINE OF THE UAEG FOLLOWING THE INITIATIVE IT PROPOSED DURING THE 
SHARM EL-SHEIKH OIC SUMMITS.  HOWEVER, THE UAE PUBLIC IS 
EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR FOR OTHER 
ARAB AND NEIGHBORING NATIONS AND FOR THE REGION AS A WHOLE.  THE 
MAIN CONCERN HERE IS WORRY FOR THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND POSSIBLE 
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES DURING THE WAR. 
 
¶5. ONE UAE PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE SUMMED UP THE POPULAR 
MOOD THUS:  "EVERYBODY IS CONFUSED.  HOW TO REMOVE SADDAM WITHOUT 
WAR? WAS IT RIGHT TO LAUNCH A WAR? NOBODY IS HAPPY WITH THE WAR, 
NOBODY.  WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND HOW TO HELP 
THEM. WE HOPE THAT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO SADDAM AT THE LAST 
MINUTE.  I WAS NOT FOR PROLONGING THE INSPECTIONS, BUT I AM VERY 
CONCERNED ABOUT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. IF THERE ARE NOT TOO MANY OF 
THEM, THE US WON'T MAKE TOO MANY ENEMIES IN THE ARAB WORLD."
