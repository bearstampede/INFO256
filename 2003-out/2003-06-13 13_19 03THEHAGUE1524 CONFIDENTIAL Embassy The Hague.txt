E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/12/2013 
TAGS: PARM PREL PBTS NATO OSCE
SUBJECT: DUTCH MFA ON "PEACE CONSOLIDATION" IN MOLDOVA PAPER 
 
REF: STATE 161930 
 
Classified By: ACTING POLITICAL COUNSELOR NATHANIEL DEAN FOR REASONS 1. 
5 (B AND D). 
 
(C) ACTING POLCOUNS DELIVERED REFTEL COMMENTS TO DUTCH MFA 
OSCE TASK FORCE OFFICERS GEOFFREY VAN LEEUWEN AND WILLEMIJN 
KALLENBERG ON JUNE 13.  AS SUGGESTED REFTEL, THE DUTCH PLAN 
TO SHARE THEIR DRAFT PAPER ON A "PEACE CONSOLIDATION" FORCE 
IN MOLDOVA WITH BOTH THE MOLDOVANS AND THE RUSSIANS.  OWING 
TO HOM HILL'S PRESENCE IN WASHINGTON NEXT WEEK, THEY PLAN TO 
PASS THEIR PAPER VIA THE MOLDOVAN AMBASSADOR IN VIENNA EARLY 
IN THE WEEK.  THEY WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THE GOM A CHANCE TO 
DIGEST THEIR IDEAS BEFORE SHARING THE PAPER WITH THE 
RUSSIANS.  THE DUTCH ACCEPTED WASHINGTON'S SUGGESTION OF 
DELETING REFERENCE TO A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF TROOPS FOR THE 
FORCE SO AS TO AVOID THE RUSSIANS POCKETING A SPECIFIC 
NUMBER.  CONCERNING REFERENCE TO THE EU'S "EXISTING PLANNING, 
COMMAND AND CONTROL CAPACITY," THEY ARE STILL WORKING ON THE 
TEXT (ACTING POLCOUNS WAS SHOWN LATEST DRAFT AND MFA'S 
NATO-CENTRIC SECURITY POLICY DEPARTMENT HAD ALSO SOUGHT TO 
ADJUST THIS LANGUAGE).  THEY CURRENTLY PLAN TO ADD AN ANNEX 
TO THE PAPER SPELLING OUT THE ESDP ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING 
HOW THE RUSSIANS MIGHT BE WOVEN INTO AN EU-LED FORCE.  (MFA 
OSCE TASK FORCE CHIEF AMB. EVERTS STRESSED IN HIS JUNE 12 
MEETING WITH AMB. PERINA THAT THE DUTCH WOULD INSIST THAT ANY 
EU OPERATION BE CONSISTENT WITH BERLIN PLUS ARRANGEMENTS.) 
VAN LEEUWEN SAID THAT WHILE THE FORCE WOULD HAVE AN OSCE 
MANDATE, THE EU WOULD MAINTAIN POLITICAL CONTROL OF THE 
MILITARY OPERATION, WITH THE RUSSIANS INCLUDED AT THE TROOP 
LEVEL.  AFTER CONSULTATIONS WITH THE EU THE DUTCH WOULD PLAN 
TO HAVE HIREP SOLANA DISCUSS THE PLAN WITH VORONIN AND THEN 
FM IVANOV.
