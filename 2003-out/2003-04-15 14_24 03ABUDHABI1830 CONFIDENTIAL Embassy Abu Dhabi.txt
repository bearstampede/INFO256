¶1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C) In delivering the Secretary's oral message 
(refs A and B), Ambassador previewed ref C talking 
points with UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs 
Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan on 4/13.  The 
Ambassador said we would be following up with UAEG 
officials.  Shaykh Hamdan responded that the UAEG 
would take this and other requests for humanitarian 
assistance to Iraq under consideration.  Post will 
follow-up with MFA officials, but anticipates 
questions regarding the logistics of delivery and 
distribution of the refined petroleum products to 
Iraq.  We would appreciate guidance on how to respond 
to these questions, as well as any further information 
available about our assessment of Iraq's domestic 
petroleum needs -- especially in light of recent press 
reports that Iraq's northern oil fields and associated 
refineries have not been significantly damaged by 
Coalition or Iraqi forces.
