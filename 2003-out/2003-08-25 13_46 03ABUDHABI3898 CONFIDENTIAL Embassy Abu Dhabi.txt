SUBJECT:  UAE REPRESENTATIVE TO THE MINISTERS OF WOMEN'S 
AFFAIRS CONFERENCE UNLIKELY TO ATTEND 
 
REFS: A) STATE 242950	B) ABU DHABI 3314 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Charge d'Affaires, a.i. Richard A. 
Albright for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (C) Econoff passed ref A information to UAE Women's 
Union Director and de facto Minister of Women's Affairs 
Nora Al-Suweidi 8/23, and later discussed the rescheduled 
event with her on the phone.  Al-Suweidi lamented that she 
would be unable to attend the Ministers of Women's Affairs 
Conference, given that the timing of the conference 
conflicted with the UAE's own First Economic 
Businesswomen's Forum on October 7-10 (ref B). 
 
¶3.  (C) Al-Suweidi said that a number of confirmed 
participants to the Abu Dhabi conference had informed her 
that they would not attend the entire event, and would 
attempt to travel to Washington for the Ministers of 
Women's Affairs Conference, as well.  She noted that it was 
unfortunate that two such important women's events had been 
scheduled for the same week -- participation in both events 
would suffer, as a result.
