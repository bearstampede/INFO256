SUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO NAJAF TERRORIST ATTACK - 
STATEMENT FROM THE UAEG 
 
Ref: A) State 250578, B) Abu Dhabi 3827, C) Abu Dhabi 3816 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Richard A. Albright, Charge d'Affaires, a.i., 
reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2. (C) On August 31, Charge delivered ref A points to 
MFA Assistant Under Secretary for Political Affairs 
Abdullah Rashid al-Noaimi urging a strong statement of 
condemnation for the terrorist attack in Najaf two 
days earlier, and an expression of support for the 
Iraqi Governing Council (GC).  PA followed up with 
Emirates News Agency Director Ibrahim al-Abed and 
Polchief with the Minister of Information's office 
director, Salem al-Amari.  The following day, the 
UAEG's public condemnation was front page news in the 
major Arabic and English language dailies.  The MFA 
statement said, "This criminal attack which occurred 
in one of the most sacred places of Islam and on the 
imam of the Mosque of Imam Ali Bin Abi Talib, is an 
attack on all Muslims and a desecration of the holy 
shrine and the values of Muslims.  It is also a futile 
attempt to sow the seed of discord and conflict among 
the Iraqi people." 
 
¶3. (U) The MFA statement added that the attack did not 
only target Ayatollah Baqir al-Hakim but also "aimed 
at killing the aspirations of the Iraqi people for a 
better future by destroying the sincere efforts 
towards national unity in Iraq and the efforts of the 
country's sincere sons and daughters to restore 
security and stability throughout Iraq."  The UAEG 
statement expressed confidence in the ability of the 
Iraqi people, under the leadership of the Iraqi 
Governing Council, to overcome this ordeal by 
safeguarding the national unity of Iraq so as to deny 
the irresponsible criminals, who are trying to wreck 
Iraq's security and stability, the opportunity to 
achieve their nefarious objective." 
 
¶4. (C) Abdullah Rashid told Charge and Polchief that 
the UAE unambiguously condemns such terrorist attacks 
as a crime against the Iraqi people.  He commented 
that the perpetrators do not want Iraq to make a 
comeback as a strong country. 
 
¶5. (U) The UAEG has consistently condemned terrorist 
attacks in Iraq (ref B) and supported the Governing 
Council (refs B and C).
