¶1.  (U)  Prince Edward Island Premier Pat Binns won a third 
consecutive majority in the province's September 29 election. 
Binns's Progressive Conservatives took 23 of the 27 seats in the 
legislature.  The Liberal Party improved its standing in the 
house dramatically, but from a low base: the Liberals went from 
one MLA to four, including new party  leader Robert Ghiz.  Voter 
turnout, despite Hurricane Juan, was over 80%. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Premier Binns is well-known to Consulate 
and Embassy staff and we not anticipate any significant changes 
in PEI policy on issues that could affect relations with the 
U.S.  The high voter turnout, in the wake of a major storm that 
did extensive damage across the province, is a remarkable 
comment on the PEI electorate's intense interest in politics. 
PEI Liberals are no doubt encouraged by their 300% increase in 
seats, but Robert Ghiz has a tough fight ahead of him to try to 
bring his party back to government.  END COMMENT.
