SUBJECT: BHUTANESE REFUGEES: CANADA CONTINUES TO PRESS FOR 
SOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 215687 
 
Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Post shared points contained reftel with Elissa 
Golberg, DFAIT's Acting Deputy Director for Humanitarian 
Affairs, on August 7. Golberg said Canada agrees that 
pressure should continue on both Bhutan and Nepal to agree to 
a durable solution for the Bhutanese refugees. Canada is 
going to continue to engage Bhutan and Nepal about the 
refugee situation bilaterally, Golberg indicated, as it 
believes a bilateral approach will be more effective at 
present.(Note: Canada has recently established a mission in 
Thimphu, and the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi is 
responsible for Canada's relations with Nepal. End note). 
 
¶2. (C) Canada agrees that UNHCR has an important role to play 
in the repatriation process, Goldberg said, particularly in 
ensuring that returns are voluntary, informed, and conducted 
with full respect for the safety and dignity of the 
returnees. Golberg said that at an appropriate juncture, 
Canada could support a multilateral agreement on 
comprehensive settlement of the refugees, including some 
third country resettlement.
