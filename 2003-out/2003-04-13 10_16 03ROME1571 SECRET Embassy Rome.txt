¶1. (S) SUMMARY. EMBASSY CONVEYED REFTEL POINTS TO GOI 
OFFICIALS AT THE MOD, MFA, PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE AND 
PRESIDENT CIAMPI'S OFFICE ON APRIL 11.  INITIAL RESPONSES TO 
OUR FIELD HOSPITAL REQUEST WERE POSITIVE, BUT NOT YET 
DEFINITIVE.  WE ARE ENCOURAGING THE GOI TO TAILOR A COMPONENT 
OF THE PROPOSAL CRAFTED BY THE GOI'S IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION TASK 
FORCE  TO MORE PRECISELY MEET THE FIELD HOSPITAL REQUEST. 
THE PROPOSAL, WHICH INCLUDES MEDICAL SPECIALISTS AND MILITARY 
PERSONNEL, WAS APPROVED BY THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS THE 
AFTERNOON OF APRIL 11.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (S) DEFMIN MARTINO'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR FRANCESCO TRUPIANO 
SAID HE WOULD RAISE THE FIELD HOSPITAL REQUEST WITH MARTINO 
AND WITH THE ITALIAN DEFENSE GENERAL STAFF (IDGS), WHICH IS 
ALREADY PREPARING A PACKAGE OF MILITARY CONTRIBUTIONS FOR 
MARTINO'S AND THE PRIME MINISTER'S APPROVAL.  THE MFA'S TASK 
FORCE IS COORDINATING ALL OTHER ITALIAN CONTRIBUTIONS, HE 
EXPLAINED, BUT THE MILITARY PACKAGE IS BEING ASSEMBLED 
SEPARATELY BY MOD BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL SENSITIVITIES 
STILL TIED TO ITALIAN MILITARY PARTICIPATION.  "NO ONE WILL 
OPPOSE SENDING MEDICINE OR FOOD BUT EVEN ONE MILITARY 
                          SECRET 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01571  01 OF 02  131015Z 
ENGINEER COULD CAUSE OBJECTIONS," HE SAID.  THE MFA TASK 
FORCE COULD GET STARTED ON THE CIVILIAN HOSPITAL REQUEST 
WHILE THE MOD DEALS WITH THE TRICKIER MILITARY PROTECTION 
ASPECT, TRUPIANO SUGGESTED.  PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL OR REVIEW 
WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE NECESSARY FOR THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTION 
BUT WOULD LIKELY BE NEEDED BEFORE ITALIAN SECURITY FORCES 
COULD BE SENT IN, ACCORDING TO TRUPIANO. 
 
¶3. (S) WE ALSO MET WITH FRANCESCO TALO, OF THE PRIME 
MINSTER'S DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR'S OFFICE, TO AMPLIFY REFTEL 
REQUEST.  TALO SAID THAT THE PROPOSAL OFFERED AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO ADDRESS PRESSING HUMANITARIAN NEEDS WHILE APPEALING TO 
ITALIANS EAGER TO ASSIST IN THE POST-CONFLICT PHASE.  BEYOND 
THAT, HOWEVER, HE WAS UNPREPARED TO COMMENT, PENDING FURTHER 
DISCUSSION WITHIN THE PM'S OFFICE. 
 
¶4. (S) IN ADDITION, WE BRIEFED THE REQUEST TO STEFANO 
STEFANINI, DEPUTY DIPLOMATIC ADVISER TO PRESIDENT CIAMPI. 
STEFANINI CONFIDENTLY PREDICTED THAT CIAMPI WOULD WELCOME A 
POSITIVE RESPONSE BY THE GOI TO OUR REQUEST, AND WOULD 
PERCEIVE NO/NO CONSTITUTIONAL OBSTACLES TO DEPLOYMENT OF 
ITALIAN TROOPS IN SUPPORT OF SUCH A HUMANITARIAN MISSION. 
 
¶5. (S) IN A MEETING WITH ECMIN, MFA DG FOR MIDDLE EAST 
AFFAIRS (AND OFFICIAL COORDINATOR OF THE MFA'S TASK FORCE FOR 
IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION) ANTONIO BADINI ENTHUSIASTICALLY WELCOMED 
THE FIELD HOSPITAL REQUEST.  IT CLEARLY FITS WITHIN THE 
PRIORITY AREAS IDENTIFIED BY THE TASK FORCE AND A THREE-PART 
PACKAGE SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS FOR APPROVAL. 
(NOTE: SUBSEQUENT TO THIS MEETING, DEPUTY TASK FORCE 
COORDINATOR LUIGI MACCOTTA NOTIFIED US THAT THE COUNCIL 
                          SECRET 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01571  01 OF 02  131015Z 
APPROVED THE PACKAGE THIS AFTERNOON.  END NOTE.)  THE FIRST 
COMPONENT OF THE PACKAGE CONSISTS OF AN INTEGRATED 1,000 
PERSON TEAM DIVIDED BETWEEN SPECIALISTS IN HEALTH CARE AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND MILITARY PERSONNEL DEPLOYED TO PROTECT THE 
TEAM AND TO HELP STABILIZE THE LOCAL SITUATION.  THE MFA 
PACKAGE ALSO PROPOSES PLACING ITALIAN EXPERTS WITH ORHA IN 
NASCENT IRAQI MINISTRIES TO ASSIST WITH INSTITUTION 
(RE)BUILDING.  THE FINAL COMPONENT CONSISTS OF ATTACHING, TO 
THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, A SENIOR ITALIAN DIPLOMAT AND GENERAL TO 
GENERAL GARNER'S OPERATION TO FACILITATE COORDINATION WITH 
THE GOI.  (FURTHER DETAILS REPORTED SEPTEL.) 
 
¶6. (S) COMMENT: THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THE COUNCIL-APPROVED 
PACKAGE COULD SERVE AS THE BASIS OF A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO 
OUR FIELD HOSPITAL REQUEST.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH 
THE GOI TO TAILOR ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO MEET THE SPECIFIC 
NEEDS WE'VE IDENTIFIED AND TO STRESS THE KEY REQUIREMENTS: 
THAT THE MEDICAL UNIT BE SELF-SUSTAINING, SELF-PROTECTING, 
UNDER CENTCOM COMMAND, AND AVAILABLE FOR DEPLOYMENT RIGHT NOW. 
 
¶7. (S) COMMENT CONTINUED: WE BELIEVE THE GOI WILL DO ALL IT 
CAN TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TO THIS REQUEST.  PM BERLUSCONI IS

FEELING VINDICATED IN HIS SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT BUSH AND WANTS 
TO FREE HIMSELF FROM THE STRAIGHTJACKET OF DOMESTIC 
OPPOSITION AND TAKE A MORE ACTIVE STANCE "ON THE GROUND." 
DEPLOYMENT OF A MEDICAL UNIT, INTO A NON-COMBAT (IF NOT FULLY 
PERMISSIVE) ENVIRONMENT, TO TREAT IRAQI CIVILIANS, COULD DRAW 
THE READY CONSENSUS OF THE ENTIRE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. A MIXED 
CIVILIAN-MILITARY DEPLOYMENT IS LIKELY TO DRAW LARGER (AND 
FASTER) CONSENSUS FROM THE PARLIAMENT AS WELL.  WHILE WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO BUILD THE HUMANITARIAN CASE WITH ALL ITALIAN 
INSTITUTIONS FOR A RAPID RESPONSE TO OUR REQUEST, ADDRESSEES 
SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THE FASTEST POSSIBLE ITALIAN RESPONSE 
MAY STILL BE SLOW BY USG STANDARDS.  END COMMENT.
