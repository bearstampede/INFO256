SUBJECT: (SBU) ANOTHER SHOOTING NON-INCIDENT 
 
Classified By: (U) AMBASSADOR RICHARD H. JONES; REASON 1.5 (a, d) 
 
¶1.  (C) On the morning of March 5, a USMC convoy from Camp 
Commando had a 7-ton vehicle break down just past the on-ramp 
onto Highway 80.  Convoy personnel heard shots impacting 
nearby.  The convoy commander crossed the highway to find out 
where the fire originated; he found some Kuwaiti officers who 
told him that some Kuwaiti soldiers were firing on a rifle 
range on a Kuwaiti military camp.  The range was oriented 
perpendicular to Hwy 80.  Contrary to earlier reports, the 
Marines did not return fire.  No injuries were reported. 
 
¶2.  (C) The initial report was that Marines in a ccnvoy were 
fired upon, that the Marines returned fire, that the 
attackers fled, and that the Marines pursued them to a mosque 
in which the attackers took refuge.  The on-scene commander 
assures that the Marines did not shoot and that there is no 
truth whatsoever to the mosque story. 
 
¶3.  (U) Suggested press guidance follows, for use on an 
if-asked basis; it has been coordinated with CFLCC PAO: 
 
On March 5, US Marines who had stopped near a Kuwaiti rifle 
range heard gunshots from the range.  There was no exchange 
of fire, and no injuries or damage.
