WFP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ENUMERATES 2003 CHALLENGES 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. WFP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JIM MORRIS LISTED 2003 NEEDS FOR 
FOOD ASSISTANCE AS UNPRECEDENTED - 4.8 MILLION METRIC TONS, 
AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF U.S. DOLLARS 2.4 BILLION, A 28 
PERCENT INCREASE IN BUDGET REQUIREMENTS OVER LAST YEAR. THE 
NEEDS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA ALONE, ESTIMATED AT U.S. DOLLARS 
1.8 BILLION, EQUAL THE 2002 WORLDWIDE WFP PROGRAM BUDGET. 
EMERGENCY OPERATIONS (EMOPS) WILL REQUIRE U.S. DOLLARS 1.2 
BILLION (2.4 MILLION MTS), PROTRACTED RELIEF AND RECOVERY 
OPERATIONS (PRROS) U.S. DOLLARS 893 MILLION (1.6 MILLION 
MTS), AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES (LARGELY SCHOOL FEEDING AND 
MOTHER-CHILD CARE), U.S DOLLARS 340 MILLION (844,000 MTS). 
MORRIS ANNOUNCED RECEIPT OF A CASH CONTRIBUTION FROM THE 
OPEC FUND OF U.S. DOLLARS 10 MILLION.

AFRICA AND ANGOLA. ON ETHIOPIA, HE REMARKED THAT ETHIOPIA 
HAS THE HIGHEST PER CAPITA RELIEF INPUT IN THE WORLD AND THE 
WORLD'S LOWEST PER CAPITA DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT. FOR 
SOUTHERN AFRICA, HE ESTIMATED THAT FOOD AID NEEDS IN 2003 
WOULD REMAIN ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS IN 2002, CITING 
PARTICULARLY BAD GOVERNANCE IN ZIMBABWE AND THE DEVASTATING 
IMPACT OF HIV/AIDS ON AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT THROUGHOUT THE 
REGION. HE UNDERLINED THE TRAGEDY ASSOCIATED WITH TODAY'S 11 
MILLION HIV/AIDS ORPHANS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. ON DPRK, 
MORRIS MENTIONED THAT THE EMERGENCY OPERATION FOR 2003 IS 10 
PERCENT FUNDED TO DATE, MEANING THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY WFP 
WILL BE UNABLE TO REACH UP TO 2.9 MILLION OF ITS INTENDED 
BENEFICIARIES DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. ON PRIVATE 
SECTOR SUPPORT, HE COMMENTED ON A U.S. DOLLAR 5 MILLION 
COMMITMENT FROM THE DUTCH CONGLOMERATE TPG WHOSE 150,000 
EMPLOYEES WILL SUPPORT CERTAIN WFP SCHOOL FEEDING OPERATIONS 
FOR A YEAR.

¶5. WFP PRESENTED ITS DRAFT STRATEGIC PLAN ANNOTATED OUTLINE 
2004-2007 (REF A) WHICH WILL BE FORMALLY REVIEWED AT THE 
OCTOBER 2003 BOARD. WFP LISTS FOUR PROGRAM WORK OBJECTIVES: 
A) SUPPORTING UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATION AND REDUCING 
GENDER DISPARITY IN ACCESS TO EDUCATION; B) SUPPORTING 
IMPROVED HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND VULNERABLE GROUPS THROUGH 
NUTRITION EDUCATION; C) SAVING LIVES IN CRISIS SITUATIONS; 
AND D) PRESERVING LIVELIHOODS IN CRISIS SITUATIONS. TWO OF 
THE FOUR CORE THEMES DESCRIBE HUMANITARIAN OBJECTIVES. 
GENDER CONSIDERATIONS APPLY TO ALL THEMES. 
 
¶6. DAA/DCHA GRIGSBY UNDERLINED USDEL'S CONCERN THAT THE 
DRAFT STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK AS PRESENTED WAS OVERLY 
OPTIMISTIC. HE QUESTIONED WFP'S CAPACITY TO PROMOTE LONGER- 
TERM SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, GIVEN WFP'S PRIMARY MISSION 
(IN USDEL'S VIEW) OF DELIVERING FOOD AND SAVING LIVES IN 
EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. USDEL SHARED COPIES OF THE DRAFT USAID- 
COMMISSIONED "FOOD AID AND FOOD INSECURITY - USAID STRATEGIC 
PLAN 2004-2009" (P. WEBB AND B. ROGERS), WHICH FOCUSES

¶7. WFP AND UNAIDS (REPRESENTED BY DR. PETER PIOT) SIGNED AN 
AGREEMENT ON FEBRUARY 6 WHICH CALLS FOR A RADICAL AND URGENT 
APPROACH TO ADDRESS THE FATAL LINKS BETWEEN HIV/AIDS,

PROGRAMMING CATEGORIES. FOOD INSECURITY DRIVEN BY AIDS CAN 
BE ADDRESSED DIRECTLY THROUGH WFP PROGRAMS, AND WFP 
ACTIVITIES CAN BE USED AS PLATFORMS FOR OTHER TYPES OF 
HIV/AIDS EFFORTS, SUCH AS PREVENTION EDUCATION. WFP WILL 
WORK PARTICULARLY CLOSELY WITH UNAIDS CO-SPONSORS AND THE 
UNAIDS SECRETARIAT IN THIS REGARD. MOREOVER, WFP WILL ADJUST 
PROGRAMMING TOOLS SUCH AS NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, VULNERABILITY 
ANALYSIS, THE DESIGN OF RATIONS AND OTHER NUTRITION-RELATED 
ACTIVITIES AS INFORMATION AND RESEARCH RESULTS BECOME 
AVAILABLE TO REFLECT THE NEW REALITY PRESENTED BY HIV/AIDS. 
FINALLY, WHEN HIV/AIDS THREATENS FOOD SECURITY AND 
INFLUENCES MORTALITY, WFP WILL CONSIDER HIV/AIDS AS A BASIC 
COMPONENT OF A PRRO, CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT WFP POLICY ON 
PRROS.
