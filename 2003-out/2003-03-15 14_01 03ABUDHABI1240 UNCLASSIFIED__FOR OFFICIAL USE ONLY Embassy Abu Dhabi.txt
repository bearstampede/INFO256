¶1. (U) Seventy five expatriate workers went on strike 
and refused to return to work until they were paid, 
reported the local press on March 13. The laborers 
accused a contracting firm of failing to pay their 
salaries for three months.  The Ministry of Labour and 
Social Affairs investigated the allegations and 
convinced the workers to return to work assuring them 
that they would be remunerated. After the 
investigation, at the Ministry's urging, the firm paid 
the employees' wages. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: This is another example of the 
generally benign attitude of the UAE government 
towards labor disputes.  Local press has prominently 
reported recent strikes by laborers in the UAE, and 
though work stoppages/strikes are not technically 
sanctioned by the law, government officials have urged 
workers to come to the Labour Ministry if they have 
disputes with their employers (see C). The government 
is also moving forward with legislation to formally 
recognize unions and clearly define their roles (see A 
and B).
