SUBJECT:  IRAQ GC MEMBER BARZANI OCTOBER 18 
VISIT TO ABU DHABI 
 
(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba,

1.(C) Iraq Governing Council member Masoud Al 
Barzani paid a visit to the UAE October 18, 
meeting with Deputy Prime Minister and MinState 
for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al 
Nahyan (HBZ), and with Qusai Mahdi Saleh, the 
new Iraqi Ambassador to the UAE.  Shaykh Hamdan 
told the Ambassador during their October 19 
meeting that he had hosted a lunch for Barzani 
and that the Chairman of the Kurdistan 
Democratic Party had left a good impression.  In 
fact, HBZ said he liked Barzani very much and 
found him to be a reasonable moderate leader. 
HBZ commented that northern Iraq holds great 
potential for investment and tourism, and 
offered that the UAE is looking into those 
possibilities.  The subject of Turkish troops 
deploying to Iraq reportedly was discussed at 
the meeting, with Barzani briefing on the GC's 
opposition to the deployment.  According to the 
official UAE news agency, Barzani commended the 
UAE Red Crescent Authority for reaching out to 
Iraqis with humanitarian assistance. 
 
2.(U) HBZ also met with IGC Chairman Dr. Iyad 
Alawi on October 20.  According to the official 
UAE news agency, Shaykh Hamdan reiterated that 
the UAE supports any efforts made by the council 
to achieve the Iraqi people's aspirations.
