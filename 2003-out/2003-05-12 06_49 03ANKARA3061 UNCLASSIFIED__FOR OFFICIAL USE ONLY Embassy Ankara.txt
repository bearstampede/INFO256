SUBJECT:  Sauces/Fanta Beverage Base Classification; 
Turkey Request Support for Candidacy at WCO 
 
Ref: (A) State 111099 (B) State 111059 
 
 
¶1. (U) Econoff presented U.S. positions on 
classification of sauces and of Fanta beverage base 
(reftels) to Ercan Saka, General Director, EU and 
Foreign Relations Department, Turkish Customs 
Undersecretariat, on May 6.  Saka responded that Turkish 
Customs would take these demarches into account in 
formulating Turkey's position on these issues.  However, 
he stated that the EU Customs Union gave Turkey very 
little flexibility to deviate from U.S. positions. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Saka told Econoff that Turkey had put forward 
the candidacy of Edip Aktas, currently a senior advisor 
at the Customs U/S, for top position at the World 
Customs Organization, competing against candidates from 
France (seeking a second term) and the Netherlands. 
Noting that he had raised Aktas' candidacy with U.S. 
Customs in the past, Saka asked for USG support in the 
WCO election.  Embassy will fax Aktas' biographical 
information to EB/TPP/MTA/MST.
