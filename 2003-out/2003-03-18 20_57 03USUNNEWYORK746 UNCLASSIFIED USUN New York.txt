HIS EXCELLENCY 
MR. NAJI SABRI 
MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ 
BAGHDAD 
 
17 MARCH 2003 
 
EXCELLENCY, 
 
ON SUNDAY 16 MARCH 2003, THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED 
KINGDOM AND THE UNITED STATES CONVEYED TO ME WARNINGS 
REGARDING THE CONTINUED SAFETY AND SECURITY OF UN PERSONNEL 
PRESENT IN THE TERRITORY OF IRAQ.  SIMILAR WARNINGS WERE 
TRANSMITTED TO DR. EL-BARADEI OF (THE) IAEA AND DR. HANS 
BLIX, THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF UNMOVIC. 
 
AFTER CONSULTING WITH DR. EL-BARADEI, DR. BLIX AND SENIOR UN 
OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF UN PERSONNEL IN 
IRAQ, I DECIDED THIS MORNING THAT, SINCE I WAS NO LONGER IN A 
POSITION TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THESE 
PERSONNEL, I WAS OBLIGED TO WITHDRAW TEMPORARILY ALL 
REMAINING HUMANITARIAN PERSONNEL NUMBERING SOME 195 
INTERNATIONAL STAFF INCLUDING THE PERSONNEL OF COTECNA AND 
SAYBOLT, THE REMAINING 135 UNMOVIC STAFF (WHICH INCLUDES WITH 
THE CONCURRENCE OF DR. EL-BARADEI 5 IAEA STAFF), AS WELL AS 
ALL UNIKOM MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL FROM IRAQ. 
 
I AM WELL AWARE THAT THESE MEASURES WILL LEAD TO THE 
SUSPENSION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE HUMANITARIAN PROGRAMMES 
IN IRAQ PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 986 (1995), AS WELL AS THE 
WORK OF BOTH UNMOVIC AND UNIKOM.  HOWEVER, THE THREAT TO THE 
SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE PERSONNEL CONCERNED HAS IN EFFECT 
RENDERED THEIR MANDATES INOPERABLE. 
 
FOR THE RECORD, I WISH TO STATE THAT I REGARD THOSE 
ACTIVITIES AS SUSPENDED DE FACTO.  THE MANDATES ESTABLISHED 
BY THE RELEVANT SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS UNDER WHICH 
THESE ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT REMAIN IN FORCE UNTIL SUCH 
TIME AS THE SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD DECIDE OTHERWISE. 
 
I INFORMED THE MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL OF MY DECISION 
IN THE INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS WHICH TOOK PLACE THIS MORNING 
AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL TOOK NOTE OF MY DECISION. 
 
ALTHOUGH THIS DECISION WAS ESSENTIAL FOR THE REASONS 
INDICATED, I SHOULD LIKE TO ASSURE YOUR GOVERNMENT THAT THE 
UNITED NATIONS CONTINUES TO BE COMMITTED TO ASSISTING THE 
PEOPLE OF IRAQ WHO HAVE SUFFERED SUCH HARDSHIP AND HAVE 
DEPENDED FOR SUPPORT ON THE OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAMME.  THE 
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMMES CAN BE RESUMED AS SOON AS THE SITUATION 
PERMITS THE RETURN OF UNITED NATIONS PERSONNEL TO IRAQ WITH 
THE AUTHORITY OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH IS RECEPTIVE TO 
THIS APPROACH. 
 
PLEASE ACCEPT, EXCELLENCY, THE ASSURANCES OF MY HIGHEST 
CONSIDERATION. 
 
 
(SIGNED) 
KOFI A. ANNAN
