SUBJECT: NEPALI KING SAYS TIBETAN DEPORTATIONS A MISTAKE

Classified By: DCM ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C)  In a June 30 meeting with the Ambassador, King 
Gyanendra opened by apologizing for May 31 deportations of 18 
Tibetans (Ref A).  He characterized the decision to deport 
the 18 as undertaken by a bureaucracy that "went off on its 
own" in the "last minutes of the former government."  The 
Government of Nepal has taken the matter very seriously, he 
continued.  The deportations were "a bump on the road," the 
King said, an aberration that does not reflect official 
policy and which he assured the Ambassador should not happen 
again. 
 
¶2.  (C)  On July 1, Abraham Abraham, Country Director for 
UNHCR in Nepal, told the Ambassador that he expects 19 
Tibetans who were detained in western Nepal on June 24 (Ref 
B) to arrive in Kathmandu later that evening and to be handed 
over to UNHCR for onward travel to India.  Abhraham described 
UNHCR as "very happy" with the treatment the refugees had 
received from government officials so far, passing on reports 
that they had been well fed and well cared for during their 
detention.  Abraham emphasized that he believes the 
low-profile approach adopted in this latest case and in the 
successful processing of another 40 Tibetans on June 13 (Ref 
C) is working well. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Comment:  The King's eagerness to emphasize that 
Government of Nepal (GON) policy remains unchanged 
underscores the importance the GON attaches to 
re-establishing its credibility on this matter.  We share 
UNHCR's optimism that the smooth processing of transiting 
Tibetans since May 31 indicates that the GON will maintain 
its earlier policy toward asylum seekers and does not plan to 
deport other Tibetans in the future.  Nonetheless, we will 
continue to monitor the situation closely.
