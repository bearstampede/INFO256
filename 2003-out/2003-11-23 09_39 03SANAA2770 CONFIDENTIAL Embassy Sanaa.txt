TRANSITION DELIVERED TO YEMENI FM QIRBI 
 
REF: A. USUN 2953 
 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 321138 
 
Classified By: CDA Alan G. Misenheimer.  Reason: 1.5(b,d) 
 
¶1. (C) On November 22, Charge, accompanied by Pol/Econ Chief, 
called on FM Qirbi to deliver ref b oral message.  Qirbi said 
he was "very encouraged" by the U.S. statements on Iraq, and 
that he viewed the program for transition as a "preliminary 
roadmap" that he hoped would gain momentum and shift the 
focus in Iraq from the military sphere to the political. 
 
¶2. (C) FM Qirbi recommended that the U.S. provide logistical 
support for the Iraqi Governing Council to control the 
security situation, as Iraq could enlist the help of other 
Arab and Muslim states if it were clear that Iraqis had 
assumed responsibility for maintaining security.  He added 
that he would like to see a clearer role for the United 
Nations.  In that regard, Charge promised to send Qirbi text 
of AMB Negroponte,s excellent 11/21 statement (ref a).
