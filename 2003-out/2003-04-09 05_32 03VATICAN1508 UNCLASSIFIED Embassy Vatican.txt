¶1. (U) ROME'S SANT'EGIDIO COMMUNITY, A VATICAN-ENDORSED LAY 
CATHOLIC NGO WITH GLOBAL REACH, WHICH SUCCESSFULLY MEDIATED 
AN END TO MOZAMBIQUE'S CIVIL WAR IN 1991, HAS LAUNCHED AN 
AMBITIOUS PROGRAM TO COMBAT HIV/AIDS IN MOZAMBIQUE. 
SANT'EGIDIO, WHICH HAS RETAINED ITS COMMITMENT TO 
MOZAMBIQUE'S DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT, REGARDS HIV/AIDS AS 
THE BIGGEST THREAT TO MOZAMBIQUE'S FUTURE AND HAS LAUNCHED 
A DRUG RESOURCE ENHANCEMENT AGAINST AIDS (DREAM) PROJECT IN 
MOZAMBIQUE TO PROVIDE HIGHLY ACTIVE ANTI-RETROVIRAL 
TREATMENT TO PREGNANT WOMEN AND LACTATING MOTHERS.  WITH 
ADEQUATE FUNDING, IT INTENDS TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO OTHER 
KEY AT-RISK SECTORS IN THE COUNTRY.  A 12-MONTH CLINICAL 
TRIAL HAS PROVEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL, REDUCING TRANSMISSION 
RATES BY UP TO 40 PERCENT AND SAVING THOUSANDS OF NEWBORNS 
FROM HIV INFECTION.  THE DREAM PROJECT HAS ALREADY SECURED 
SUPPORT FROM MULTINATIONAL DRUG COMPANIES, AND MOZAMBIQUE'S 
MINISTER OF HEALTH, FRANCISCO SOGNANE EXTOLLED THE BENEFITS 
OF THE SANT'EGIDIO PROJECT FOR MOZAMBIQUE'S PEOPLE AND 
URGED THAT IT BE ENLARGED TO ENCOMPASS A GREATER NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE INFECTED WITH HIV/AIDS.  ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL 
ALLOW THE PROJECT TO BE EXPANDED THROUGHOUT MOZAMBIQUE, AND 
POTENTIALLY BEYOND. EMBASSY BELIEVES THAT DREAM FITS LIKE A 
GLOVE WITH THE PRESIDENT'S INTERNATIONAL MOTHER AND CHILD 
HIV PREVENTION INITIATIVE AND RECOMMENDS THAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE, USAID, AND EMBASSY MAPUTO WORK WITH SANT'EGIDIO TO 
EXPAND THIS PROMISING PROJECT ADMINISTERED BY A GROUP WITH 
A PROVEN TRACK RECORD.  END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST.

SANT'EGIDIO: AFTER PEACE, TAKES AIM AT HIV/AIDS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. (U) THE SANT'EGIDIO COMMUNITY, A VATICAN-APPROVED LAY 
MOVEMENT -- NOT LIMITED TO CATHOLICS -- WITH MORE THAN 
40,000 MEMBERS DEDICATED TO CHARITY, HUMANITARIAN, AND 
CONFLICT RESOLUTION EFFORTS IN MORE THAN 60 COUNTRIES, WAS 
INSTRUMENTAL IN MEDIATING AN END TO MOZAMBIQUE'S 
DEVASTATING CIVIL WAR IN 1991.  THE COMMUNITY'S COMMITMENT 
TO MOZAMBIQUE HAS NOT ABATED SINCE THEN, AND IT IS NOW 
ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN ENSURING THAT THE HARD-WON PEACE LEADS 
TO BETTER ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE PEOPLE OF 
MOZAMBIQUE.  TODAY, SANT'EGIDIO RECOGNIZES THAT THE 
INCREASINGLY HIGH INCIDENCE OF HIV/AIDS IN MOZAMBIQUE IS 
NOW THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THE NATION'S FUTURE, DESTROYING 
FAMILIES AND UNDERMINING ECONOMIC PROGRESS.  AS A RESULT, 
ANDREA RICCARDI, THE KINETIC FOUNDER AND HEAD OF THE 
COMMUNITY HAS DEVELOPED AN INITIATIVE TOGETHER WITH THE 
SIZEABLE SANT'EGIDIO COMMUNITY IN MOZAMBIQUE AIMED AT 
REVERSING THE SPREAD OF HIV/AIDS THROUGH ANTI-RETROVIRAL 
TREATMENTS. 
 
¶3. (U) ACCORDING TO SANT'EGIDIO, THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS 
IN AFRICA HAS BEEN BASED PREDOMINANTLY ON PREVENTING MORE 
AFRICANS FROM CONTRACTING THE VIRUS.  SANT'EGIDIO BELIEVES 
THIS HAS NOT WORKED, EVEN WHILE THEY SUPPORT CONTINUED 
EFFORTS AT EDUCATION AND PREVENTION.  THEY POINT OUT THAT 
NO EPIDEMIC HAS BEEN OVERCOME BY PREVENTION ALONE. 
MOREOVER, THEY BELIEVE THE LACK OF ACCESS TO TREATMENT 
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PREVENTION, AS 
PEOPLE FEAR BEING TESTED AND FOUND TO BE POSITIVE BECAUSE

DREAM:  TREATMENT THAT WORKS 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) SANT'EGIDIO'S DRUG RESOURCE ENHANCEMENT AGAINST AIDS 
IN MOZAMBIQUE (DREAM) PROJECT IS OFFERING ACCESSIBLE 
TREATMENT TO PEOPLE WITH HIV/AIDS, BEGINNING WITH PREGNANT 
AND LACTATING MOTHERS.  ANTI-RETROVIRAL DRUGS ARE 
ADMINISTERED TO PREGNANT WOMEN TO SAVE BOTH MOTHER AND 
CHILD, THEREBY PREVENTING A MOTHER'S OTHER CHILDREN FROM 
BECOMING ORPHANS.  CONDUCTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL 
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND VOLUNTEERS, AND WITH EXISTING 
HEALTH DEPARTMENT FACILITIES AND STAFF, DREAM USES HIGHLY 
ACTIVE ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPY (HAART) TO PREVENT VERTICAL 
(MOTHER-FETUS) TRANSMISSION OF THE HIV VIRUS.  TREATMENT IS 
OFFERED FREE OF CHARGE.

WHO ARE IN AN ADVANCED STAGE OF THE DISEASE.  PARTICULAR 
ATTENTION WILL ALSO BE GIVEN TO PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE SUCH AS 
HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND TEACHERS WHO ARE KEY TO 
MOZAMBIQUE'S DEVELOPMENT.  HOSPITAL AND DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE 
WILL ALSO PROVIDE COUNSELING, TESTING, TREATMENT OF 
OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS AND STDS, NUTRITIONAL EDUCATION 
AND FOOD AID. 
 
B) PREVENTING VERTICAL TRANSMISSION:  DREAM FORESEES THAT 
MOTHERS INFECTED WITH HIV RECEIVE HAART TO PREVENT VERTICAL 
TRANSMISSION.  AFTER GIVING BIRTH THE THERAPY CONTINUES TO 
PREVENT INFECTION BY BREAST-FEEDING. 
 
C) TRAINING:  DREAM WILL BE STAFFED BY MOZAMBICANS, WHICH 
REQUIRES INVESTMENT IN LOCAL AND OVERSEAS TRAINING FOR ALL 
PERSONNEL INVOLVED, A WELL AS A PROGRAM OF SUPERVISION AND 
IN-SERVICE TRAINING. 
 
D) LABORATORY:  TREATING HIV POSITIVE PEOPLE WITH HAART 
DEMANDS ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC SUPPORT AND MONITORING OF ANY 
ADVERSE EFFECTS.  DREAM HAS ALREADY SET UP THE FIRST TWO 
MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABS IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY (MAPUTO) 
AND IN THE CENTER AT BEIRA.  A SIMILAR LAB IS PRESENTLY 
BEING EQUIPPED AT NAMPULA IN THE NORTH OF MOZAMBIQUE. 
 
E) INFORMATION NETWORK:  ALL DREAM ACTIVITIES ARE MONITORED 
THROUGH AN IT NETWORK LINKING THE TREATMENT CENTERS AND 
LABS.

FIRST RESULTS PROMISING 
----------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) THE FIRST RESULTS OF DREAM WERE PRESENTED AT THE 
TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RETROVIRUS AND 
OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS HELD IN BOSTON IN FEBRUARY.  FOUR- 
HUNDRED FORTY HIV POSITIVE PATIENTS, PRIMARILY PREGNANT 
WOMEN, PARTICIPATED IN THE INITIAL DREAM PROGRAM IN ORDER 
TO GAUGE THE EFFECTS OF THERAPY ON MOTHER-FETAL 
TRANSMISSION.  OF THESE, 240 FOLLOWED THE STANDARD THERAPY 
USED IN WESTERN COUNTRIES.  MORTALITY RATES WERE LOWERED; 
THE QUALITY OF THE PATIENTS' LIFE IMPROVED MARKEDLY, AND 
THE AMOUNT OF THE VIRUS IN THE BLOOD DECREASED NOTICEABLY. 
ABOVE ALL, THE PROGRAM REVEALED A HIGH CONTINUING 
PARTICIPATION RATE -- A POINT OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE IN 
A DEVELOPING COUNTRY LIKE MOZAMBIQUE.  THE RESULTS SHOWED 
THAT EVEN IN NATIONS WITH A BASIC HEALTH SYSTEM IT IS 
POSSIBLE TO USE A THERAPEUTIC MODEL THAT IMPACTS 
SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE RATE OF HIV INFECTION.  THE RESULTS OF 
THE DREAM TRIAL ARE TO BE PUBLISHED IN AN UP-COMING EDITION 
OF THE PRESTIGIOUS BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL LANCET. CLINICAL 
RESULTS OF THE TRIAL ARE AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET: 
WWW.RETROCONFERENCE.ORG/2003/ABSTRACT/WORDHTM L/2127.HTM 
 
¶7. (U) THE SANT'EGIDIO COMMUNITY FURTHER ELABORATED THESE 
RESULTS AND PRESENTED ITS PROJECT AT A RECENT GATHERING IN 
ROME ATTENDED BY EMBASSY OFFICERS.  IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE 
DREAM PROJECT HAS ALREADY EARNED THE WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT 
OF A VARIED GROUP OF ENTITIES RANGING FROM MULTINATIONAL 
DRUG COMPANIES TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN GERMANY.

HIV/AIDS.

INTERNATIONAL MOTHER AND CHILD HIV PREVENTION INITIATIVE 
FOCUSED ON INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF PREVENTIVE CARE, 
INCLUDING DRUG TREATMENTS, AND BUILDING HEALTHCARE DELIVERY 
SYSTEMS TO REACH AS MANY WOMEN AS POSSIBLE WITH THE CARE 
THEY NEED.  IN FACT, AFTER DCM SHARED THE PRESIDENT'S 
JANUARY ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS NEW HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE WITH 
SANT'EGIDIO, ONE OF ITS SENIOR OFFICIALS SAID HE FELT AS IF 
THE PRESIDENT WAS READING FROM THEIR PROPOSAL BECAUSE OF 
THE COMMON FOCUS ON ANTI-RETROVIRAL DRUGS, MOZAMBIQUE, 
PREVENTING MOTH-CHILD TRANSMISSION, AND PRESERVING FAMILY 
UNITS.  THE PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT STATED THAT THE 
ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING TO WORK WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS,

¶9. (U) EMBASSY BELIEVES IT WOULD BE HARD TO FIND A FAITH- 
BASED INITIATIVE WITH BETTER PROSPECTS THAN THE SANT'EGIDIO 
DREAM PROJECT.  WE NOTE THAT THE COMMUNITY OF SANT'EGIDIO, 
FOUNDED IN ROME IN 1968, IS VATICAN-ENDORSED CATHOLIC LAY 
MOVEMENT WITH MORE THAN 40,000 MEMBERS (NOT ALL CATHOLIC) 
DEDICATED TO CHARITY AND HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS IN MORE THAN 
60 COUNTRIES.  THE COMMUNITIES ARE COMMITTED TO SOLIDARITY 
WITH THE POOR AND SUFFERING INCLUDING PHYSICALLY AND 
MENTALLY DISABLED, HOMELESS, FOREIGN IMMIGRANTS, PEOPLE 
WITH HIV/AIDS, TERMINALLY ILL PEOPLE, PRISONERS, ELDERLY, 
ROMA AND SINTI, AND REFUGEES.  IT IS ALSO A LEADING FORCE 
FOR ECUMENICAL DIALOGUE AS A WAY TO PROMOTE PEACE AND CO- 
OPERATION AMONG RELIGIONS, AND TO RESOLVE ARMED CONFLICTS. 
COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO RESOLVING THE 
CONFLICTS IN MOZAMBIQUE AND GUATEMALA, AND HAVE HELPED 
MEDIATE PEACE EFFORTS IN AFRICA'S GREAT LAKES REGION AND 
KOSOVO.  EMBASSY VATICAN HAS PREVIOUSLY FUNDED A 
SANT'EGIDIO PROJECT IN KOSOVO THAT SEEKS TO RECONCILE SERBS 
AND ETHNIC ALBANIANS AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LEVEL.  WE 
MAINTAIN AN ACTIVE DIALOGUE WITH SANT'EGIDIO ON A BROAD 
RANGE OF AFRICAN ISSUES, AND THEY CONSULT REGULARLY WITH 
SENIOR USG OFFICIALS.

DREAM PROJECT, WHICH DCM PASSED TO USAID MOZAMBIQUE DESK 
OFFICER FOR FUNDING CONSIDERATION IN FEBRUARY.  IN LIGHT OF

THE PRESIDENT'S NEW INITIATIVE WITH ITS FOCUS ON MOZAMBIQUE 
AND THE ANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENTS BEING IMPLEMENTED 
THROUGH THE PROGRAM, WE BELIEVE THIS OFFERS AN IDEAL 
PROGRAM FOR FUTURE USG FUNDING.  SANT'EGIDIO HAS TOLD US 
THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY CHARTED AN AMBITIOUS EXPANSION OF 
THE PROGRAM, WHICH IS LIMITED ONLY BY THE LEVEL OF FUNDING. 
WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH WASHINGTON AGENCIES AND 
EMBASSY MAPUTO TO HELP FUND THIS PROMISING PROJECT, WHICH 
CAN SAVE THOUSANDS OF NEWBORNS FROM HIV INFECTION, KEEP 
FAMILIES INTACT, AND REDUCE POVERTY.
