Â¶1. (C) On October 31, PolOff delivered reftel demarche on 
U.S. Mideast UNGA strategy to Pieter Ramaer, Head of the 
MFA's Political and Legal Affairs Division.  Ramaer said 
"U.S. arguments are good," and the Dutch are in favor of 
ending or limiting those practices mentioned.  However, 
Ramaer noted that consolidating a resolution is easier than 
abolishing entire divisions, sending staff home and cutting 
funding.  According to Ramaer, "something has to be done to 
improve conditions on the ground," otherwise it will prove 
difficult to garner support for certain aspects of the U.S. 
strategy.  Ramaer believes it will be difficult to end the 
mandate of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli 
Practices, but said the EU "has never had much sympathy" for 
the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of 
the Palestinian People.  He said he will discuss all reftel 
points with the Dutch delegation in New York, and that any 
decisions made would be within an EU framework.
