SUBJECT: LOCAL POLITICAL PARTIES STAGE ANTI-AMERICAN 
PROTEST -- KATHMANDU 
 
 
¶1.  On Tuesday, 18 February, a group of ten leftist political 
parties staged an anti-American protest, culminating with the 
delivery of a protest letter to the Embassy.  The crowd 
numbered around 100.  Their slogans decried US war with Iraq 
and North Korea, and US Imperialism.  The protest was 
peaceful and short-lived.  It was consistent with past 
protests against the USG, such as those that took place in 
the aftermath of our bombing campaign in Afghanistan just 
over a year ago. 
 
¶2.  As usual, Post received excellent support from the Nepal 
Police assigned to control the protest.  The police contained 
the protesters outside direct line of sight of the Embassy, 
allowing only two of the groups' representatives to come 
forward and present their protest letter as agreed in advance 
by Post. The protest took place without violence or other 
incident.
