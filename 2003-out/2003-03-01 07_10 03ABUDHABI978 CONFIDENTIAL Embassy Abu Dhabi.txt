SUBJECT: MOVING FORWARD WITH EXBS TRAINING FOR THE 
DUBAI PORTS AND CUSTOMS AUTHORITY 
 
REF:  ABU DHABI 299 
 
¶1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA 
FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶2.  (U)  THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE -- PLEASE SEE 
PARAGRAPH FOUR. 
 
¶3.  (C)  The Dubai Ports and Customs Authority 
(DPA), which oversees Jebel Ali and Port Rashid 
(together the 12th largest port in the world), has 
on several occasions indicated to us that they are 
eager to move ahead now with Export Control 
initiatives.  The UAE federal authorities 
(Ministry of Foreign Affairs) have told us that 
they are supportive of the USG providing 
appropriate training directly to DPA.  While some 
aspects of our bilateral EXBS roadmap -- such as a 
workshop on legislation -- must necessarily wait 
until the UAE federal government clarifies 
responsibilities and authorities (a matter 
currently pending before the Cabinet, see reftel), 
we nonetheless can and should move forward with 
other training that we can provide directly to 
DPA.  Among the items we can work directly with 
DPA are: 
 
-- US Customs' Container Security Initiative; 
 
-- training on detection/identification of 
controlled substances; and, 
 
-- review/assessment of DPA procedures from an 
export controls perspective.  (Note:  An 
assessment might usefully include manifest data 
collection and management, a review of existing 
export control lists, and an assessment of the 
port/customs interface and port operations more 
generally -- particularly with regard to 
transshipment. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Action request:  Post requests 
Washington addressees coordinate in developing a 
program of EXBS activities we may present to DPA. 
 
¶5.  (U)  This message coordinated with Amconsul 
Dubai.
