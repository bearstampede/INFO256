SUBJECT: JORDANIAN BORDER CONTROL WITH IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 213480 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request.  See para 4. 
 
¶2.  (S)  PolCouns July 28 covered with Samer Dabbas, Iraq 
action officer in FonMin Muasher's Private Office, ref points 
requesting that the GOJ tighten its border controls with 
Iraq.  Dabbas said that he believed considerable GOJ 
resources had already been devoted to border control with 
Iraq, but that many of them might be concentrated around the 
Karama-Trebil crossing point.  He asked that the U.S. provide 
Jordan with specific USG concerns about smuggling and illegal 
transit across the Jordan-Iraq border so the GOJ can 
understand the problem the U.S. sees and move to counter it 
effectively. 
 
¶3.  (S)  The A/DATT separately raised ref points with the 
senior leadership of the Jordan Armed Forces (JAF), asking 
for increased JAF coverage on the border with Iraq. 
 
¶4.  (S)  COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST:  USG cooperation with 
the GOJ on border security is very close.  We would 
appreciate any details available of the smuggling and illegal 
transit activity that the USG believes is occurring through 
Jordan so we can pinpoint for the GOJ how it can counter such 
activities. 
 
¶5.  (U)  CPA Baghdad minimize considered.
