SUBJECT:  AN UPBEAT HAMDAN ASSURES THAT UAEG 
          UNDERSTANDS USG WOULD NOT INTENTIONALLY 
          STRIKE BAGHDAD EMBASSY 
 
REF:  State 89928 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (S) The Ambassador contacted an extremely upbeat 
MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan on 
4/9 to convey reftel talking points.  Hamdan was not 
at all worried, noting that the UAE diplomatic staff 
in Baghdad exited the country.  Were the embassy to 
be inadvertently hit, Hamdan assured, the UAEG would 
understand; he fully realizes the complexity of the 
situation. 
 
¶3. (S) Hamdan said he had been following the 
dramatic television coverage of the day's events in 
Baghdad and was very pleased to see footage of 
Iraqis celebrating in the streets and speaking out 
about the regime.  One image -- that of an Iraqi 
hitting a picture of Saddam's face with the bottom 
of shoe -- captured the day's emotions, in Hamdan's 
view.
