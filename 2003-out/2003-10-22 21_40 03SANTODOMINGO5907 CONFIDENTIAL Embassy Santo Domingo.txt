Classified By: Acting ECOPOL counselor Bainbridge Cowell for reasons 1. 5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Acting ECOPOL counselor delivered points Refs A-B in 
Spanish and Ref C in English to Acting International 
Organizations Director, Ambassador Rhadis Abreu de Polanco, 
on October 22.  She reiterated continuing support for the 
Coalition of the Willing and informed us that the GODR would be represented at the Madrid Donors Conference by Dominican Ambassador to Spain Vega Imbert.  She also promised to convey the points immediately to Deputy Foreign Affairs Secretary Miguel Pichardo.  We stressed the value of the GODR's diplomatic and material support to Coalition reconstruction efforts in Iraq, particularly the 300 Dominican troops already deployed with the stabilization force.  We asked to be informed of any further contribution the GODR might make in Madrid. 
 
¶2. (C) Comment:  We did not deliver this demarche at 
ambassadorial level for the following reasons:  The Dominican Republic is in the midst of a financial crisis, and the USG is pressing the GODR to comply with tough requirements for urgently needed IMF disbursements under a recently agreed standby arrangement.  It would be counterproductive to request  further Dominican financial or material contributions to the Iraq reconstruction effort beyond maintaining the current significant troop deployment.  We anticipate that the GODR will continue its consistent diplomatic support for Coalition of the Willing initiatives in the UN and Iraq.
