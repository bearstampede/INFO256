SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ANPP CHAIRMAN SAYS PARTY WILL SEEK 
REDRESS  THROUGH TRIBUNALS 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASONS 1.5 (B) 
AND (D). 
 
 
¶1.  (C) During an April 30 meeting with DCM, All Nigerian 
People's Party (ANPP) Chairman Chief Don Etiebet expressed 
anger with ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) 
manipulation of the recent Presidential, Gubernatorial and 
National Assembly elections.  Citing numerous examples of 
PDP misconduct, Etiebet said the recent elections did not 
reflect the will of the people.  Etiebet warned that while 
Nigerians now only feel despair, that despair might turn to 
anger should the electoral flaws not be redressed. 
 
 
¶2.  (C) Despite talk of "mass action" by some ANPP members, 
including Presidential candidate Buhari, Etiebet said the 
electoral tribunals would be his party's venue of choice 
for airing grievances and that the ANPP would abide by 
tribunal decisions.  While not optimistic, Etiebet hoped 
the tribunals would reject elections in the areas of the 
worst misconduct.  He also hoped that focusing attention on 
the problems with these elections would avert similar 
difficulties in the upcoming State Assembly and Local 
Government elections.  Again, though not optimistic, 
Etiebet expressed hope that vigorous investigation and 
assessment of April's election would pave the way for freer 
and fairer elections in 2007.
