SUBJECT:  WARY OF SHARON'S INTENTIONS, UAE 
NEVERTHELESS GRATEFUL FOR POTUS 
ENGAGEMENT ON PEACE PROCESSS 
 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid and the 
Ambassador discussed the upcoming peace process 
summits in Sharm El Sheikh and Aqaba in a 5/31 
meeting at Hamdan's Abu Dhabi palace (other issues 
septel).  While "pessimistic" about Israeli Prime 
Minister Sharon's ultimate commitment to forging 
peace and wary of Israel's stated reservations on 
the roadmap, Hamdan was nevertheless very grateful 
for President Bush's evident personal involvement. 
Hamdan said he hoped to proven wrong about Sharon 
and noted that the UAE had much confidence in Abu 
Mazen. 
 
¶3. (C) Hamdan disclosed that he speaks with Abu 
Mazen on a regular basis and had heard from him 
earlier in the day.  The Palestinian Prime Minister 
confided that he had been satisfied with his 
meeting with Sharon.  However, Abu Mazen told 
Hamdan that the Palestinian Authority desperately 
requires security equipment, much of which has been 
destroyed by the Israelis in the last two years. 
Abu Mazen had raised the issue with Sharon.  The 
Palestinians were in such dire straits that when 
the Israeli Prime Minister, in last week's meeting, 
had offered to withdraw Israeli forces from some 
Palestinian towns (NFI), Abu Mazen was placed in 
the awkward position of actually turning down the 
offer.  Abu Mazen confided in Hamdan that he does 
not want be blamed for problems he cannot control.
