SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GON CALLS ARTICLE 98 AN EXECUTIVE 
AGREEMENT 
 
 
REF: ABUJA 1134 
 
 
¶1.  (U) The Nigerian Solicitor-General (the highest ranking 
civil servant in the Ministry of Justice and the official 
who executed the Article 98 Agreement on behalf of the GON) 
I.A. Ayua indicated in a July 14 letter to Ambassador Jeter 
that the GON has deemed the Article 98 agreement an 
executive agreement.  Thus, there will be no need to seek 
National Assembly ratification. 
 
 
¶2.  (U) The Agreement will come into force upon the 
exchange of Notes between the USG and the GON indicating 
that each has fulfilled the domestic legal requirements to 
bring the Agreement into force.  Embassy Abuja transmitted 
the U.S. Note on July 3 and we will now ask the GON to 
reciprocate. 
 
 
¶3.  (U) A scanned copy of Ayua's letter has been sent to 
AF/W via e-mail.
