¶1. (C) A Senior KOC official tells the Embassy that the KOC 
firefighting team is now on site at the Ratqa Field camp in 
Northern Kuwait.  They visited the site of burning oil wells 
in the Rumaila field in Southern Iraq yesterday, and intend 
to enter Iraq again tomorrow to begin the work of 
extinguishing the fires.  A separate KOC official said that 
the firm will likely bring the Ratqa field back on line soon 
to reduce pressure in the field (which straddles the border 
into Iraq) and make the fire fighting efforts easier).  (N.B. 
 Other KPC officials had reported that no fields were shut 
in.)
