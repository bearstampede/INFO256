SUBJECT: COLOMBO EAC MEETING APRIL 1, 2003 
 
 
¶1.   (SBU) On April 1, 2003 Colombo Emergency Action 
  Committee (EAC) met to discuss the local security situation. 
  The DCM chaired the EAC. 
 
¶2.   (SBU) The EAC discussed the 2000-person protest on 
  March 28 and agreed that despite the use of tear gas to 
  disperse the crowd, the situation in Colombo remains fairly 
  calm. 
 
¶3.   (SBU) The IBB representative reported a local from the 
  area in which IBB is located briefly stirred things up by 
  blaming the U.S. (and the police stationed at IBB) for his 
  traffic fine.  He reportedly also made anti-U.S. comments. 
  It appears, however, that the situation at IBB facility in 
  Iranawila, Sri Lanka (which broadcasts into Iraq) is also 
  calm. 
 
¶4.   (SBU) No members of the EAC reported significant 
  problems with the police deployment at all residences.  The 
  EAC decided to continue the request for assistance.  The LAV 
  shuttle and the Ambassador's Police Special Task Force 
  protective detail will also remain in force at least until 
  the EAC reconvenes. 
 
¶5.   (SBU) A local newspaper quotes a representative of a 
  local NGO as saying that arrangements are being made to send 
  Sri Lankan youths to Iraq to support Iraqi forces.  RSO will 
  bring this matter to the attention of local authorities and 
  attempt to determine if this story is fabricated or true. 
 
¶6.   (SBU) The EAC agreed to meet again on Friday April 4.
