E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV PTER JO
SUBJECT: COURT CONVICTS, SENTENCES, AND ORDERS THE RELEASE 
OF "REFORM AND CHALLENGE" DEFENDANTS 
 
REF: AMMAN 07813 
 
¶1.  (U)   The State Security Court on December 10 convicted 
five men of sabotage and possession of explosive material for 
a plot dating back five years.  The court sentenced a sixth 
man involved in the group, known as "Reform and Challenge," 
to four years for complicity in plotting subversive acts. 
Judge Fawaz Bqour ordered their immediate release "since they 
had already spent the sentenced time in prison."  The 
prosecutor can appeal the verdict within 30 days. 
 
¶2.  (U)  The group is believed responsible for carrying out a 
series of unsophisticated bombings in 1998 that damaged cars 
but caused no casualties.  The State Security Court had 
acquitted the group, but the Cassation Court overturned the 
verdict, asking the lower court to re-evaluate its 
proceedings.  The prosecution charge sheet claimed that the 
defendants since 1994 had targeted intelligence departments, 
police departments, and an Amman hotel, according to press 
reports.  The group reportedly aimed to "change the status 
quo in Jordan" by preaching the use of force.
