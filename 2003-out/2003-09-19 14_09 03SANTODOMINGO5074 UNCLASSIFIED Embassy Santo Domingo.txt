¶1. Poloff delivered reftel talking points by email and fax to 
Ambassador for Human Rights Anabella de Castro on September 
¶15.  Talking points were also sent on September 16 to Indotel 
President and Secretary of State for Telecommunications 
Orlando Jorge Mera.  Mr. Mera assured Poloff that he would 
send talking points to Indotel representatives in Geneva. 
According to Ambassador de Castro, Indotel traditionally 
takes the government's lead on freedom of the press issues, 
not the Foreign Ministry.  At first glance, neither 
Ambassador de Castro nor Mr. Mera expressed any potential 
problems.
