SUBJECT:  AS REGIONAL POWER CENTER SHIFTS, UAE 
NO LONGER TAKING TUTELAGE FROM RIYADH 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) During a May 7 meeting with the Ambassador, 
MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan shared the 
substance of a spat he had with Saudi Crown Prince 
Abdullah.  Apparently, Abdullah had told an Arab 
expat (well known in Gulf circles for his 
connections to GCC leaders) that he was extremely 
displeased that the Emiratis had decided to send a 
representative to the April 28 Baghdad "tent 
meeting."  Saudi Arabia had decided against such 
representation and believed that the smaller GCC 
states should have followed suit.  An incensed 
Hamdan had asked the conduit to send the following 
back to Abdullah:  "The UAE is a sovereign state 
which neither takes orders nor waits to see what 
direction others take before making decisions.  The 
regional situation has changed and the Saudi 
leadership should not behave as it did 10 years 
ago." 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT:  Anticipating a potential shift in 
the center of power from Riyadh to points 
northward, it appears that Abu Dhabi is already 
chafing at the Saudi suggestion that the Emiratis 
should continue to take their cues on policy 
decisions from their Saudi brothers.  END COMMENT.
