SUBJECT: RESIDENTIAL SECURITY CLUSTER HOUSING 
 
REF: STATE 245380 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy Colombo has one residential cluster housing 
compound for American employees of the IBB (VOA) remote 
broadcasting site. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The compound is located in the town of Negombo, 
about halfway between the IBB site in Iranawila and Colombo. 
Negombo is 1.5 hours north of Colombo, the IBB site is 
another hour north of Negombo.  The compound consists of five 
leased houses within a walled compound situated in a rural 
area about one-quarter mile off the main Negombo Road. 
Although the compound is increasingly surrounded by various 
grades of village huts and simple block houses, the area is 
best described as isolated.  Currently, three of the houses 
are occupied by IBB employees, with a fourth used as TDY 
quarters.  The fifth house is empty.  All houses are alarmed, 
locked and grilled.  Also included in the compound is a 
swimming pool, tennis court, children's playground and guard 
booth.  Three Local Guards are posted at the compound 24 
hours.  Vehicle access is controlled by a heavy steel gate on 
rollers and a separate drop-bar.  The perimeter wall is 
substandard cinderblock varying in height 7-9 feet.  Two CCTV 
cameras overlooking the compound became inoperable three 
months ago. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Because the Negombo housing compound is in a remote 
location and isolated from any nearby embassy support, 
enhanced physical security upgrades are vital to the security 
of the occupants, which includes spouses and children. RSO 
has surveyed the property and determined that the north 
perimeter wall should be enhanced with an anti-climb barrier 
such as razor wire.  Post estimates it has sufficient 
resources to complete this project in-house.  RSO has also 
determined a complete external camera upgrade is needed at 
the compound.  Four remote cameras are needed at each corner 
of the compound, a fifth camera is needed for the internal 
vehicle gate, and a sixth camera is needed for the road 
outside compound entrance. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) OBO assistance is requested to fund this 
recommended CCTV upgrade.  Funding estimates are as follows: 
 
(6) Camera Surveillance Systems at 1,500 each - $9,000 
(2) Outdoor Dome Wall Mounts at 350 each - $700 
(4) Pressurized Dome Wall Mounts at 1,400 each - $5,600 
(1) Video Multiplexer at 800 each - $800 
(6) 4.5 mm Camera Lens at 150 each - $900 
(1) CCTV Switcher at 850 each - $850 
(4) Color Monitors at 330 each - $1320 
(1) System Controller w/ joystick at 700 each - $700 
(1) Video Input Board at 250 each - $250 
 
Installation, Shipping and Labor - $10,000 
 
 ¶5.  (SBU) Post requests a total of $30,120 to complete the 
residential security enhancements described above.  POC for 
this request is RSO Alex Moore (94)(1) 244-8601.
