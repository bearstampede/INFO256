¶1. (U) Classified by DCM Richard Albright for 
       reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
2.(C) In advance of the March 3-6 WTO services 
negotiations in Geneva, UAE Ministry of Economy Director 
of WTO Affairs Saeed Al-Nasibi publicly announced 
on March 2 that the UAE does not intend to open its 
banking, insurance, telecommunications and other services 
sectors to foreign investors at this time -- despite 
expected pressure from "industrialized nations," left 
unnamed, later this week.  Comment: While such a position 
may be unhelpful, the UAE is under no obligation to open 
up those sectors it specifically set aside under the terms 
of its accession to the WTO in 1996; they are in fact 
"unbound," and the UAE's exemptions are indefinite in 
duration.  End comment. 
 
¶3. (C) According to Al-Nasibi, the UAE has little incentive 
to license new foreign banks because it is the "most 
over-banked country in the world, based on the number 
of banks per capita" -- foreign banks outnumber national 
banks, 26 to 21.  He elaborated, however, that foreign banks 
are permitted to open representative offices here.  (Note: 
This is a well-worn argument of the UAE Central Bank, which 
since 1987 has largely enforced a ban on new foreign full- 
service banking operations.  End note.)  Al-Nasibi also 
stated that the UAEG would continue to give preference to 
UAE nationals -- in effect denying national treatment to 
foreign investors -- in the services sector to encourage 
citizens to invest in their country. 
 
¶4.  (U) According to press reports, Al-Nasibi will chair 
the UAE delegation to Geneva for the March 3-6 WTO services 
negotiations.  Representatives from the UAE Labor Ministry, 
Central Bank, Etisalat (the UAE's monopoly telecom provider), 
and the Federations of Chambers of Commerce will also attend.
