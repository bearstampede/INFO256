E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/19/2013 
TAGS: IZ PARM PREL UNSC
SUBJECT: ITALY TO OPPOSE SPECIAL UNGA/IRAQ SESSION 
 
REF: A) STATE 70678 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POL MC THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 

 
¶1.  (C) POLMIN DELIVERED REF A POINTS TO CLAUDIO BISOGNIERO, 
THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR THE MFA'S BUREAU FOR 
MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RIGHTS.  POLMIN ALSO NOTED 
WITH APPRECIATION RECENT POSITIVE STATEMENTS BY PM BERLUSCONI 
AND FM FRATTINI REAFFIRMING ITALY'S FRIENDSHIP WITH THE 
UNITED STATES AND OPENING ITALIAN BASES AND AIRSPACE TO THE 
USG. 
 
¶2.  (C) BISOGNIERO CALLED POLMIL BACK LATE 18 MARCH.  AFTER 
CONSULTATIONS WITHIN THE GOI BISOGNIERO STATED HE HAD ISSUED 
CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS TO THE ITALIAN UN DELEGATION TO OPPOSE ANY 
MOVES TO USE UNGA OR OTHER UN FORA FOR MISCHIEF MAKING ON 
IRAQ.  HE NOTED THERE HAD BEEN NO INDICATIONS FROM THE 
ITALIAN DELEGATION IN NEW YORK ABOUT EFFORTS TO RAISE THE 
IRAQ ISSUE OUTSIDE THE UNSC. 
 
¶3. (C) SEPARATELY, HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICE DIRECTOR GIUSEPPE 
CALVETTA (WHO PREVIOUSLY SERVED IN GENEVA) NOTED THE 
COMPOSITION OF CHR-59 WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO PREVENT A 
SPECIAL SEATING/DISCUSSION IF ARAB STATES AND THE AFRICA 
GROUP ALL SUPPORTED ONE.  CALVETTA SUGGESTED WE ISSUE A 
"DECLARATION," IN GENEVA OR WASHINGTON, REAFFIRMING OUR 
COMMITMENT TO RESPECT NONCOMBATANTS' HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
DETAILING THE STEPS WE WOULD TAKE TO DO SO.  WE NOTED THAT 
SENIOR U.S. OFFICIALS, INCLUDING CJCS MYERS, REPEATEDLY HAVE 
ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE PUBLICLY.  NONETHELESS, CALVETTA 
OBSERVED, THE DYNAMICS WITHIN THE CHR SUGGESTED TO HIM THAT A 
PROACTIVE U.S. STATEMENT WOULD SAP MUCH OF THE MOMENTUM FROM 
EFFORTS TO ORGANIZE A SPECIAL SEATING.
