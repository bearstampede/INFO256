MEETING WITH FM PICULA 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) DURING AN INTRODUCTORY CALL ON JULY 2, AMBASSADOR 
FRANK AND FM PICULA EXCHANGED VIEWS ON THE STATE OF 
U.S.-CROATIA RELATIONS.  PICULA REVIEWED THE FOREIGN POLICY 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE COALITION GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAD 
REMAINED REMARKABLY STABLE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS.  THE 
COALITION'S AGENDA WAS AMBITIOUS AND BEGINNING TO BEAR FRUIT, 
ESPECIALLY IN THE ECONOMIC SECTOR.  PICULA EMPHASIZED THE 
IMPORTANCE TO CROATIA OF MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU AND NATO.  HE 
WAS OPTIMISTIC THAT THE U.S. AND CROATIA WOULD CONTINUE THEIR 
CLOSE COOPERATION, BUILDING ON PAST ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  U.S. 
AND EU SUPPORT TO ACHIEVING CROATIA'S FOREIGN POLICY GOALS 
WAS ESSENTIAL.  PICULA SAID THAT RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF CLOSE 
COOPERATION BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND BRUSSELS WAS CRUCIAL. 
 
¶3. (C) AMBASSADOR FRANK NOTED CROATIA'S MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
AND AGREED THAT THERE WAS MORE YET TO BE DONE.  IN THIS 
REGARD, THE U.S. FULLY SUPPORTED THE GOC'S ASPIRATIONS FOR EU 
AND NATO MEMBERSHIP.  THE U.S. CERTAINLY WAS NOT ASKING 
CROATIA TO CHOOSE BETWEEN NATO AND THE EU.  HE NOTED THAT THE 
GOC MUST COMPLY WITH THE ICTY, ACCOMMODATE ALL RETURNEES, 
NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, REFORM THE 
JUDICIAL SECTOR AND CONTINUE BUILDING A MARKET ECONOMY. 
WHILE CROATIA HAD BEEN HELPFUL IN THE GWOT, IT COULD DO MORE. 
 AS AN INDICATION OF OUR COMMITMENT, THE U.S. HAD TO DATE 
    PROVIDED $285 MILLION IN ASSISTANCE TO CROATIA.  AMBASSADOR 
FRANK EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF USING PRIVATE 
COMMUNICATIONS TO DISCUSS POTENTIALLY DIVISIVE ISSUES. 
 
¶4.  (C) PICULA SAID HE WOULD RAISE THE AMBASSADOR'S POINTS 
WITHIN THE CABINET, ESPECIALLY ON CLOSER COOPERATION IN THE 
GWOT.  HE ALSO PLEDGED THAT HE WOULD NOT RAISE DIVISIVE 
BILATERAL ISSUES IN THE PRESS. 
 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT MESIC 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) FOLLOWING HIS PRESENTATION OF CREDENTIALS ON JULY 2, 
AMBASSADOR FRANK MET PRIVATELY WITH PRESIDENT MESIC AND TWO 
SENIOR ADVISORS.  THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE SAME ISSUES WITH 
MESIC WHO SAID HE WOULD "FIX" THE SHORTCOMINGS IN GWOT 
COOPERATION.  HE ALSO PLEDGED TO WORK PRIVATELY WITH THE U.S. 
TO RESOLVE CONTENTIOUS ISSUES IN OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6. (C) WE ARE ENCOURAGED THAT BOTH PICULA AND MESIC TOOK A 
VERY POSITIVE TONE IN THESE MEETINGS AND HAVE CLEARLY 
RECOGNIZED THE SHORTCOMINGS OF DEALING WITH THE USG IN THE 
PRESS RATHER THAN USING PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE U.S.  WE 
PLAN TO TEST THESE COMMITMENTS IN COMING WEEKS WITH BOTH THE 
PRESIDENT AND FOREIGN MINISTER. 
FRANK
