Officer of Central America and Caribbean Division at the MFA, 
to discuss the Dutch response to the recent crackdown in Cuba 
on pro-democracy activists.  Groenemeijer stated that the 
Dutch support the points in ref A and have not only made a 
symbolic gesture of inviting pro-democracy activists to the 
Dutch Mission in Havana's National Day celebrations last 
April, but also are discouraging high-level government to 
government visits.  He indicated that the EU is discussing 
the best strategy to approach this issue to put pressure on 
Castro to release the prisoners of conscience.  Groenemeijer 
agreed that the USG and the EU should be working together 
towards a joint initiative.  He inquired whether the USG has 
finalized a policy on this issue and opined that he believes 
that the USG should focus on supporting civil society in Cuba.
