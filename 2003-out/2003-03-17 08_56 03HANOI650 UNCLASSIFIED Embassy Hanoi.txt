¶5.  A number of issues with the above data exist.  In 
addition to the unavailability of recent data, data is 
constantly in flux due to poor collection mechanisms. 
Furthermore, Vietnam has begun to decentralize some 
expenditures even though it has yet to establish a single 
accounting system for budget reporting, making central 
accounting even more difficult.
