SUBJECT: KUWAIT SNUBBING ARAB LEAGUE MEETING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 75616 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, reasons 1.5 b and d. 
 
¶1. (C) The Ambassador reviewed reftel demarche with Shaykh 
Dr. Ahmed Nasser al-Sabah, Office Director for Minister of 
State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. Mohammed al-Sabah, on 
the morning of March 23.  Shaykh Ahmed informed the 
Ambassador that Dr. Mohammed would not be attending the March 
24 Arab League foreign ministers' meeting.  Kuwait would be 
represented instead by its Ambassador in Cairo.  Nonetheless, 
Dr. Ahmed assured the Ambassador that Kuwait would work 
against efforts to condemn the US for the action in Iraq. 
However, he said, "we are only one country; we need support 
from others."  He added that one of Kuwait's main objectives 
would be to get the Arab League to condemn Iraq for launching 
surface-to-surface missiles at Kuwait even though at the time 
no attack had been launched at it from Kuwaiti soil. 
 
¶2. (C) COMMENT: Dr. Mohammed normally represents the GOK at 
such meetings.  Sending the Kuwaiti Ambassador to Egypt in 
his stead is a clear signal of Kuwait's displeasure with the 
recent performance of the Arab League in general and of AL 
Secretary General Amr Moussa in particular.
