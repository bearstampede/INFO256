questionnaire requested in ref telegram.  The answers are 
keyed to questions from paragraph 2 until 6.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. Questionnaire 
¶A.   Desired Labor Market Position - 72nd Percentile. 
A1.Post's desired labor market position for FSN compensation 
remains at the 72nd percentile for all grades.  Post's most 
recent wage increase, implemented on May 18, 2003, including 
several different percentage increases, brings post's 
overall average market position to the 67th percentile. 
Salary adjustment of the previous year brought us to the 
62nd percentile.  Post believes that bringing salaries to a 
competitive position in the labor market will continue to 
help us in recruiting and retaining LE staff. 
 
Post does not have an existing Exception Rate range.
