SUBJECT:  UAE CENTRAL BANK ANNOUNCES SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON 
HAWALA, APRIL 
2-3, 2003 
 
REF: 02 ABU DHABI 2522 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Charge D'Affaires Thomas Williams for reasons 1.5 
(B) and (C). 
 
¶2.  (U) This is an action request; please see paragraph 5. 
 
¶3.  (C) On the heels of the very successful May 2002 Hawala Conference 
in Abu Dhabi 
(reftel), UAE Central Bank Governor Sultan Al-Suweidi officially 
notified the 
Ambassador on February 5 of his intention to host the Second 
International Conference 
on Hawala in Abu Dhabi, April 2-3, 2003.  The preliminary agenda 
includes panel 
discussions by representatives from FATF, law enforcements agencies, 
and academia, 
and presentations from banking representatives from Central Asia, the 
Middle East, 
and Africa among others. 
 
¶4.  (C) Comment:  Additional information regarding the conference 
agenda and a 
registration form will become available on the UAE Central Bank's 
website 
(WWW.CBUAE.GOV.AE) in the next few days.  The draft agenda does not 
mention charities 
and charitable organizations, despite the Governor's earlier 
indications that the 
topic would be discussed during or on the margins of the Second Hawala 
Conference. 
We will raise this with the Governor in subsequent meetings and report 
any response 
we receive.  End comment. 
 
¶5.  (C) Action request: Post requests that USG participants -- once an 
official 
delegation is constituted via the interagency process -- allow the 
Embassy to 
coordinate travel and accommodations and that they not/not register 
directly for the 
conference via the UAE Central Bank website.  This will ensure that the 
U.S. 
delegation can be located together, simplifying considerably the 
logistical 
arrangements.
