¶1. Per refs A, B, C, and D Honduras and El Salvador are 
looking to move forward on border demarcation via a 
binational border commission but progress has been stymied 
due to outdated maps.  Their joint request, received at both 
Embassy Tegucigalpa and San Salvador, is for maps at scale of 
1:25,000 (ref C). 
 
¶2. Ref D material has been reviewed by Raul Andino Torres, 
President of the Honduran Special El Salvador-Honduras Border 
Demarcation Commission and a number of technical engineers. 
Mr. Andino Torres informed Poloff March 7 that the 
information in ref D, while informative, was at too large a 
scale to be useful for border demarcation purposes. 
 
¶3. Post notes that the border demarcation issue has received 
broad press coverage in both El Salvador and Honduras.  The 
process has been stalled for some time and tensions have been 
mounting.  Post concurs with ref C and urges the State 
Department to contact NIMA at the earliest possible moment in 
order to request appropriate assistance.
