SUBJECT:  UAE SUPPORTIVE OF UNSCR TO LIFT 
SANCTIONS 
 
REF:  STATE 118163 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) The Ambassador delivered reftel demarche to 
MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan on May 7, 
laying out our plan to introduce soon a UNSCR to 
lift the sanctions on Iraq.  Hamdan said the UAE 
wanted to see the sanctions lifted as soon as 
possible and would support our efforts.  The 
Ambassador noted that we would welcome public 
statements once our mission in New York has had an 
opportunity to brief the Arab Group members. 
Addressing the humanitarian crisis in Iraq, Hamdan 
wondered aloud "where are the other Arab states?" 
In his view others should and could be doing more.
