SUBJECT: UAEG BLACKLISTS FIRMS FOR VIOLATING LABOR LAWS 
 
¶1. (U) Local press reported that the Ministry of Labour 
and Social Affairs blacklisted 375 companies in Abu 
Dhabi and 549 in Dubai and the Northern Emirates 
between January 1 and June 30 for violating labor laws. 
The Ministry inspected over 10,000 businesses in Dubai 
and the Northern Emirates during this period to ensure 
that companies were properly applying health and safety 
laws.  The blacklisted companies cannot obtain work or 
sponsorship permits, or have any dealings with the 
Ministry until they fix their problems. The Ministry 
reinstated 176 companies during the same period for 
redressing their errors. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: The Ministry of Labor has committed 
itself publicly to strictly regulating and enforcing 
labor laws.  The inspection and blacklisting of so many 
firms demonstrates the Ministry's resolve in 
implementing its ambitious agenda of effectively 
policing local labor conditions. End comment.
