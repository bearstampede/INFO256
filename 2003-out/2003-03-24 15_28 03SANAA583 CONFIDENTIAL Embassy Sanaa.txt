(C)  During a March 24 meeting between DCM and MFA's Americas 
Office Chief Abdul-Salam Q. Al-Awadi, DCM reviewed reftel 
demarche (delivered to the MFA on March 23) highlighting USG 
concerns about the imminent Arab League statement.  Awadi 
agreed to forward our request to the appropriate officials. 
He also noted his own view that AL statements are often vague 
and confusing, and the USG should, thus, not be overly 
concerned with the upcoming statement.
