SUBJECT: EXTRADITION OF ARNOLD FREDERICK MORRIS 
 
REF: TEGUCIGALPA 00099 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: ARNOLD FREDERICK MORRIS HAS AN OUTSTANDING 
ARREST WARRANT IN THE U.S. FOR CONSPIRACY, ILLEGAL 
CONCEALMENT OF ASSETS, MAKING FRAUDULENT AND FALSE 
STATEMENTS, AND CONSPIRACY IN MONEY LAUNDERING. ON 
MARCH 18, 1992, MR. MORRIS OBTAINED HONDURAN 
CITIZENSHIP FRAUDULENTLY BY CONCEALING HIS U.S. 
CRIMINAL HISTORY, HOPING TO AVOID EXTRADITION, GIVEN 
THAT THE HONDURAN CONSTITUTION DOES NOT ALLOW 
EXTRADITION OF ITS NATIONALS. NEVERTHELESS, ON MARCH 
7, 1995, THE USG OFFICIALLY REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION 
OF ARNOLD FREDERICK MORRIS. ON AUGUST 16, 1996, 
HONDURAN SOLICITOR GENERAL REQUESTED REVOCATION OF 
MORRIS' HONDURAN CITIZENSHIP. EVER SINCE, HIS CASE HAS 
BEEN APPEALED THROUGH THE HONDURAN COURT SYSTEM. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. CURRENTLY, MORRIS HAS THREE JUDICIAL ACTIONS 
PENDING IN THE COURTS: 
 
- AN APPEAL FILED BY MORRIS ON MARCH 25, 2002, WITH 
THE SUPREME COURT ARGUING THAT THE REQUEST FOR THE 
CANCELLATION OF HIS HONDURAN CITIZENSHIP SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN FILED BY THE SOLICITOR GENERAL AND NOT BY THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
 
- AN APPEAL FILED BY THE SOLICITOR GENERAL ON NOVEMBER 
29, 2002, WITH THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE COURT OBJECTING THE RULING OF THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE COURT IN SAN PEDRO SULA.  THE SAN PEDRO 
SULA COURT HAD SUSPENDED THE CANCELLATION OF HIS 
NATIONALITY WHILE THE ACQUISITION WAS BEING 
CHALLENGED. 
 
- AN APPEAL FILED BY MORRIS ON MARCH 5, 2003, FOR 
INTERIM EQUITABLE RELIEF IN ORDER TO INSURE THE 
EXECUTION OF THE RULING RENDERED BY ADMINISTRATIVE 
COURT IN SAN PEDRO SULA, ON OCTOBER 24, 2002, AND 
REJECTED BY THE SOLICITOR GENERAL ON JUNE 9, 2003. 
 
 
¶3. ON JUNE 9, 2003, THE SOLICITOR GENERAL FILED A 
MOTION WITH THE COURT REJECTING MORRIS' REQUEST FOR 
INTERIM EQUITABLE RELIEF.  ON JUNE 10, 2003, POST WAS 
ADVISED BY THE SOLICITOR GENERAL'S OFFICE OF THE MARCH 
5, 2003, MORRIS REQUEST FOR INTERIM EQUITABLE RELIEF 
IN ORDER TO INSURE THE EXECUTION OF THE RULING 
RENDERED BY THE SAN PEDRO SULA COURT.
