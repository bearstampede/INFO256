START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Mrs. Indikadahena has recently returned from an 
assignment with the Sri Lanka Mission at the UN in 
Geneva.  During this period, Mrs. Indikadahena has able 
to actively participated in WTO negotiations and was 
involved in formulating developing country positions. 
She has a strong understanding of WTO laws and 
principles.  Currently, she is assigned to the Commerce 
Department of Sri Lanka as Deputy Director.  She is 
engaged in work related to multilateral issues, 
including WTO negotiations and bilateral trade. 
We hope the experience of meeting a wide cross section 
of US policy makers, visiting institutions of interest, 
and meeting counterparts from around the world will 
broaden her outlook and also give her an understanding 
of US trade policy background.  In particular, due to 
her strong familiarity with developing country issues, 
we expect that an exposure to US trade policy making 
will give her a balanced view of global trade issues. 
Mrs. Indikadahena's participation in this program will 
help to develop better cooperation on trade matters 
including WTO issues, and make progress towards a FTA 
using TIFA discussions.
