¶1.  (C) Charge, accompanied by Acting DCM, delivered the 
Deputy Secretary's oral message (ref A) to MFA Undersecretary 
Khaled al-Jarallah December 16.  He took the opportunity to 
deliver ref B demarche asking the GOK to use its influence on 
Iraqis -- especially tribal leaders -- to urge them to 
participate in the political process that is underway in 
Iraq. 
 
¶2.  (C) The Undersecretary responded that the GOK as host of 
the upcoming GCC Summit would draw extensively on the Deputy 
Secretary's points in drafting the communique and 
 
SIPDIS 
resolutions.  He said Kuwait was "totally optimistic" about 
the Summit, which would take place at a time when there is a 
"very positive spirit in the region," made even more so by 
the capture of Saddam Hussein (about which he said 
"Congratulations to you and to ourselves"). With regard to 
terrorism, he expected the GCC leaders to give their blessing 
to a draft GCC agreement against terrorism and instruct their 
Ministers of Interior to sign it "soon."  This agreement, he 
asserted, would facilitate practical steps against terrorism. 
 
¶3.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered.
