SUBJECT: UAE GETS SECRETARY'S ORAL MESSAGE TO GCC 
         FOREIGN MINISTERS 
 
REF:  STATE 32894 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Charge D'Affaires Thomas Williams 
for reason 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2. (S) Charge delivered reftel oral message to MFA 
A/USEC for Political Affairs Abdullah Rashid Al-Nuaimi, 
February 6.  Abdullah Rashid indicated that his father, 
nominal UAE Foreign Minister Rashid Abdullah Al-Nuaimi, 
would be representing the UAE at the February 8 GCC 
meeting; he promised to brief him fully on the 
Secretary's message.  In terms of his own reaction, the 
 
SIPDIS 
A/USEC responded positively, noting that "the last point 
is very clear to the UAE;" President Zayid has 
repeatedly said -- as has the GCC -- that the 
responsibility for the current situation lies with Iraq, 
and that time is running out for Iraq to make good on 
its obligations to comply fully with the relevant 
Security Council resolutions.  Abdullah Rashid added 
that in the current situation the international 
community and the Security Council have responsibilities 
of their own which they must also carry out.
