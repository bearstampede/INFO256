SUBJECT: DUTCH MFA ON DECEMBER PSI MEETING

Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Nathaniel P. Dean for reasons

(C) On November 13, PolOff delivered reftel points on the 
December PSI operational experts' meeting to Hedda Samson, 
Policy Officer in the Dutch MFA's Security Policy Bureau 
Nonproliferation office.  Samson has served as the Dutch 
operational expert in previous PSI meetings.  Samson noted 
reports in the Belgian press suggesting the GOB had been 
invited to contribute to PSI.  (Note:  the Dutch have 
supported involving other EU members in PSI.  Concerning 
Belgium, it is worth noting that sea access to and from the 
port of Antwerp passes solely through the Dutch territorial 
waters of the West Schelde river.  Under the terms of an 1842 
treaty governing the West Schelde, the Dutch are obliged to 
treat ships proceeding to and from Antwerp as being on the 
high seas and cannot interfere with them.  As Antwerp is the 
second largest port in Western Europe, this could have 
implications for PSI actions.)
