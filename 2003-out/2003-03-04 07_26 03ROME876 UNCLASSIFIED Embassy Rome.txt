SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. WHILE VISITING FEBRUARY 15-21 IN ETHIOPIA (REPORTED REF 
A), IT BECAME CLEAR THAT FURTHER AND IMMEDIATE ATTENTION IS 
NEEDED BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND ITS PARTNERS IN ADDRESSING 
THE INSIDIOUS POTENTIAL OF HIV/AIDS TO TURN DROUGHT CRISES 
INTO CATASTROPHE. END SUMMARY.

¶2. THE RAVAGES OF HIV/AIDS IN ETHIOPIA REQUIRE SPECIAL 
ATTENTION. WHILE VISITING FEBRUARY 15-21 IN ETHIOPIA, WE 
WERE GIVEN A SET OF NUMBERS - AN ESTIMATED 2.2 MILLION 
ADULTS AND CHILDREN INFECTED (UNAIDS AND MOH), WITH A 
NATIONAL PREVALENCE OF 6.6 PERCENT PER GOVERNMENT (GFDRE) 
SENTINEL SITES; AND AN ESTIMATE OF 10 - 23 PERCENT 
PREVALENCE (2002) IN URBAN AREAS. 
 
¶3. AS FRIGHTENING AS THESE NUMBERS ARE, AS PER A REPORT 
ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE COUNCIL (AVAILABLE ON 
THEIR WEBSITE), ENTITLED "THE NEXT WAVE OF HIV/AIDS: 
NIGERIA, ETHIOPIA, RUSSIA, INDIA AND CHINA" (SEPTEMBER 
2002), THEY MAY BE UNDERESTIMATES. QUOTE: 
 
"GOVERNMENT FIGURES CITE 2.7 MILLION ETHIOPIANS CURRENTLY 
AS HIV POSITIVE, ALTHOUGH EXPERTS BELIEVE THE ACTUAL NUMBER 
MAY BE BETWEEN 3 AND 5 MILLION. THE GENERALLY POOR HEALTH OF 
ETHIOPIANS AS A RESULT OF DROUGHT, MALNUTRITION, LIMITED 
HEALTHCARE, AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES HAS CAUSED HIV TO 
PROGRESS RAPIDLY TO AIDS. LOOKING AHEAD, WE EXPECT 7 TO 10 
MILLION WILL BE INFECTED BY 2010 BECAUSE OF THE HIGH CURRENT 
RATE OF ADULT PREVALENCE, WIDESPREAD POVERTY, LOW EDUCATION 
LEVELS, AND THE GOVERNMENT'S LIMITED CAPACITY TO RESPOND 
MORE ACTIVELY."  END QUOTE. 
 
¶4. THE REPORT DRAWS A NUMBER OF CHILLING CONCLUSIONS: 
 
-THE PROFESSIONAL CLASSES IN ETHIOPIA ARE PARTICULARLY 
VULNERABLE BECAUSE ADULT PREVALENCE RATES ARE HIGH AND 
RELATIVELY FEWER ELITES ARE CONCENTRATED IN A SMALL NUMBER 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  00876  01 OF 04  040821Z 
OF KEY POSITIONS; 
-THE DRAG OF AIDS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL FURTHER REDUCE THE 
ABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO HANDLE THE RISING SOCIAL AND 
HEALTHCARE COSTS; 
-THE FURTHER DETERIORATION OF GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS COULD 
WEAKEN ETHIOPIA'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PLAY A REGIONAL 
LEADERSHIP ROLE; 
-RISING SOCIAL TENSIONS OVER AIDS COULD EXACERBATE REGIONAL 
AND ETHNIC TENSIONS WITHIN ETHIOPIA.

"THE WORLD KNOWS THAT HIV/AIDS IS FATAL. THE WORLD ALSO 
KNOWS THAT SOUTHERN AFRICA, WHERE SOME OF THE HIGHEST HIV 
PREVALENCE RATES ARE FOUND, HAS SUFFERED FROM SERIOUS FOOD 
SHORTAGES AFFECTING MILLIONS OF IMPOVERISHED PEOPLE. BUT THE 
WORLD CLEARLY DOES NOT YET REALIZE THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG - 
TERM IMPLICATIONS OF A CRISIS CAUSED BY THE CONJUNCTION OF 
HIV/AIDS WITH CHRONIC POVERTY, ERRATIC RAINFALL, PROBLEMATIC 
GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND NATURAL RESOURCE DEGRADATION, OR THE 
URGENT NEED IT SIGNALS FOR A PROFOUND SHIFT IN HUMANITARIAN 
AND DEVELOPMENTAL STRATEGIES. 
 
IN THE SIX COUNTRIES CURRENTLY SUFFERING FOOD SHORTAGES IN 
SOUTHERN AFRICA, THE HIV/AIDS PANDEMIC IS ENDANGERING THE 
LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND UNRAVELLING

ONLY RECENTLY HAVE THE GOVERNMENTS OF SOME OF THE MOST 
AFFECTED COUNTRIES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA BEGUN TO COMPREHEND 
THE CRISIS THAT IS UPON THEM - A REALITY THAT HAS DRIVEN 
SOME POLITICAL LEADERS IN THE REGION TO SPEAK OF THE THREAT 
OF EXTINCTION. IT HAS TAKEN THE LOUD EMERGENCY OF A SEVERE 
FOOD SHORTAGE AFFECTING 15.1 MILLION PEOPLE TO DEMONSTRATE 
TO THE UNITED NATIONS AND ITS PARTNERS THE INSIDIOUS 
POTENTIAL OF HIV/AIDS TO UNDERMINE ENTIRE SOCIETIES AND 
NATIONS AND TURN CRISES INTO CATASTROPHES." END QUOTE.

NEXT STEPS FOR UN AGENCIES FROM BOTH THE MORRIS/LEWIS AND US 
MISSION PERSPECTIVE 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶6. SOME KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE UN AGENCIES FROM THE 
MORRIS/LEWIS REPORT ARE AS FOLLOWS: 
 
A) THE UNITED NATIONS MUST PROVIDE A POWERFUL AND ENERGIZING 
LEADERSHIP, AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE AGENCIES, FUNDS AND 
PROGRAMS, IN ORDER FOR THE PANDEMIC TO BE CONFRONTED 
URGENTLY AT COUNTRY LEVEL. NOTE: US MISSION ADDS THAT THIS 
NEEDS TO BE DIRECTLY REFLECTED IN THE UN COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT 
FRAMEWORK (UNDAF). END NOTE. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  00876  02 OF 04  040821Z 
 
B) UN SHOULD CONSIDER REVISITING PREVIOUS METHODS OF SHORING 
UP GOVERNMENTS AND POPULATIONS IN CRISIS -- INCLUDING DIRECT 
CASH ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANZATIONS THAT 
SUBSIDIZE SOCIAL SECTORS, AND DIREC SUPPORT TO MINISTRIES, 
ORGANIZATIONS AND INSTITUIONS THAT ARE LOSING THE HUMAN 
RESOURCES AND SKILED PROFESSIONALS REQUIRED TO FUNCTION 
EFFECTIVEY. 
 
C) DUE TO HIV/AIDS, THE NUMBERS OF CHRONICALY FOOD INSECURE 
AND THOSE REQUIRING NUTRITIONAL UPPORT CAN BE EXPECTED TO 
INCREASE OVER THE LONG TERM. THERE IS A 
NEED TO EXPLORE AND INSTITUTIONALIZE ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS 
THAT PROVIDE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT FOOD AND ADEQUATE 
NUTRITION. THIS SHOULD BE DONE IN WAYS THAT ENCOURAGE 
PARTICIPATION IN PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE SELF-RELIANCE 
AND STIMULATE LOCAL AND REGIONAL PRIVATE-SECTOR CAPACITY TO 
MEET DEMAND FOR FOOD. 
 
D) THE UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM MUST CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE AND

SUPPORT GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE A MORE PROACTIVE LEADERSHIP ROLE 
WITH RESPECT TO COMBATING HIV/AIDS. THE REPORT RECOMMENDS 
THAT POSITIVE LEGISLATION BE INTRODUCED THAT PROTECTS WOMEN, 
AND THAT SOCIAL REFORM BE ENACTED THAT ADDRESSES THE BURDEN 
OF CARE CARRIED BY WOMEN. THE ROLE OF THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF 
GOVERNMENT IN LEADING A VISIBLE EFFORT AGAINST HIV/AIDS AND 
IN SUPPORT OF WOMEN CANNOT BE UNDERESTIMATED AND SHOULD BE 
ENCOURAGED. 
 
E) UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES NEED TO COMMIT THEMSELVES TO 
REVIEWING THEIR EMERGENCY AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS IN AREAS 
OF HIGH HIV PREVALENCE THROUGH THE "LENS" OF HIV/AIDS. 
MOREOVER, AGENCIES SHOULD CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE WITH THEIR 
PARTNERS AND DONORS FOR THE NEED TO FULLY INTEGRATE HIV/AIDS 
INTO THEIR ACTIVITIES.

¶7. IN US MISSION'S VIEW, UN AGENCIES CAN ALSO ASSIST IN 
STRUCTURING EFFECTIVE HIV/AIDS STRATEGIES, AS FOLLOWS: 
 
F) THE GLOBAL FUND TO FIGHT HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND 
MALARIA - IS A KEY RESPONSE INSTRUMENT IN THE EVOLUTION OF 
GLOBAL HEALTH PROGRAMS PRODUCING MORE EFFECTIVE RESULTS. THE 
UN IS URGED TO ASSIST, AND WHERE APPROPRIATE PLAY A LEAD 
ROLE, WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS IN MAKING SURE THAT AN EFFECTIVE 
COUNTRY COORDINATION MECHANISM (CCM) IS IN PLACE. 
 
G) ALL MAJOR UN INTER-AGENCY MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING 
(MOUS) (BETWEEN UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP, WHO, ETC.,) SHOULD BE 
REVIEWED TO ENSURE AND EXPAND THE COLLABORATION RELATED TO 
TARGETING FOOD INSECURE HIV/AIDS-PRONE OR AFFECTED 
POPULATIONS IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. 
 
H) BOTH THE UN AND THEIR NGO PARTNERS NEED TO QUICKLY 
INTENSIFY AND EXPAND ACTIVITIES TO STRENGTHEN HIV/AIDS 
INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS, CARE FOR ORPHANS, AND TRAINING FOR 
SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BETTER MANAGE THIS PANDEMIC. 
 
I) UN PARTNERS NEED TO COME TOGETHER IN ESTABLISHING 
STANDARD INDICATORS AND METHODS FOR INCORPORATING HIV/AIDS 
IN FOOD SECURITY, CROP AND VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS. MORE 
AND BETTER ESTIMATES OF THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF AIDS IN 
COUNTRY ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO FULLY UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS 
ITS DEVASTATING IMPACT. 
 
J) UN AGENCIES (WFP, UNICEF, FAO) ARE ENCOURAGED TO WORK 
ALONG WITH WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) TO ACCELERATE THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  00876  03 OF 04  040822Z 
REVIEW OF EXISTING MATERIAL ON "HIV/AIDS AND NUTRITION" AND 
DEVELOP JOINT UN GUIDELINES. 
 
K) UN AGENCIES ARE URGED TO BECOME FORCEFUL ADVOCATES WITH 
PARLIAMENTARIANS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN EVERY COUNTRY TO 
DEVELOP NATIONAL POLICIES FOR ORPHANS AND INNOVATIVE 
COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE CARE AND SUPPORT FOR 
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN NEED.

¶8. MY RECENT TRIPS TO SOUTHERN AFRICA (REFS B AND C) AND TO 
ETHIOPIA HAVE BROUGHT HOME TO ME THE RECENT COMMENT OF DR. 
PETER POIT (UNAIDS CHIEF) THAT "HIV/AIDS IS RAPIDLY WIPING 
OUT DECADES OF DEVELOPMENT AND CONTRIBUTING TO REGIONAL 
INSTABILITY. THE CASE FOR INCREASING ACTION AGAINST THIS 
EPIDEMIC HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER OR MORE URGENT." I SEE A 
GROWING NEGATIVE SYNERGY BETWEEN AIDS AND FAMINE, AS FEWER
