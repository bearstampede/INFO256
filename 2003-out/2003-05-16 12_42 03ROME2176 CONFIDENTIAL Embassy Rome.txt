TAGS: PHUM ELAB IT HUMAN RIGHTS
SUBJECT: CHILD PROTECTION COVENANTS: ITALY 
 
REF: REF: STATE 126276 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: LABOR COUNSELOR JOHN BASS, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (C) ITALY HAS RATIFIED ALL THREE COVENANTS; THE COVENANTS 
ON CHILDREN IN ARMED CONFLICT AND SALE OF 
CHILDREN/PROSTITUTION WERE RATIFIED AND IMPLEMENTED IN MARCH 
2002 AND ILO 182 TWO YEARS EARLIER IN MAY 2000.  WE 
PERIODICALLY DISCUSS CHILDREN'S RIGHTS ISSUES WITH GOI 
INTERLOCUTORS, MOST RECENTLY IN THE RUN-UP TO THE ANNUAL 
SESSION OF THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION.  ITALIAN OFFICIALS 
EVINCE A STRONG COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING AND UPHOLDING 
    CHILDREN'S RIGHTS, A POSITION THAT REFLECTS BROAD SOCIETAL 
SUPPORT AND CONSENSUS.  THESE DISCUSSIONS INVARIABLY INCLUDE 
POLITE BUT POINTED INQUIRIES FROM OUR ITALIAN COLLEAGUES 
SEEKING CLARIFICATION OF WHETHER THE  U.S. INTENDS TO RATIFY 
THE UMBRELLA CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD. 
 
¶2. (U) ITALIAN AUTHORITIES STRONGLY ENFORCE ITALIAN LAW AND 
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS COVERING CHILDREN'S RIGHTS.  IN THE 
LAST FEW MONTHS, NATIONAL POLICE ROLLED UP AN ORGANIZED CRIME 
GROUP AUCTIONING OFF BABIES OF PROSTITUTES AND ARRESTED 400 
IN A NATIONWIDE CRACKDOWN ON CHILD PORNOGRAPHY ON THE 
INTERNET, TO CITE BUT TWO RECENT EXAMPLES.
