SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  POWELL'S WARNINGS TO SYRIA IRAQ THE 
ROADMAP 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  POWELL'S WARNINGS TO SYRIA, THE RECONSTRUCTION OF 
IRAQ, AND THE ROADMAP DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE PRINT MEDIA.  AN 
"AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL CRITICIZED THE SITUATION IN THE REGION 
FOLLOWING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND ARAB ATTITUDES TOWARDS RECENT 
DEVELOPMENTS, NOTING THAT THE U.S. AIM IS TO PROTECT ISRAEL. 
ANOTHER "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIAL LABELED U.S. THREATS TO SYRIA AS 
GUARANTEES OF ISRAEL'S SECURITY.  AN "AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIAL 
URGED THE U.S. TO EXERT SERIOUS EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT THE ROADMAP 
AND NOT TO BE AFFECTED BY ISRAEL'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  CONDOLEEZZA RICE'S INTERVIEW WITH THE ISRAELI NEWSPAPER 
"YEDIOTH AHRONOTH" RECEIVED EXTENSIVE EDITORIAL COVERAGE IN UAE 
ARABIC MEDIA, WHO QUOTED HER AS SAYING "THE U.S. ADMINISTARTION 
BELIEVES THAT ISRAEL'S SECURITY IS THE KEY TO SECURITY NOT ONLY 
IN THE REGION, BUT ALSO IN THE WORLD." 
 
¶3.  Criticizing the situation in the region after the war in Iraq 
and Arab attitudes towards recent developments, Sharjah-based pan- 
Arab daily "Al-Khaleej" editorialized 5/05: 
 
"... It seems that some or even most of the Arabs did not 
understand that they should eliminate 'resistance,' 'struggle,' 
'jihad' and 'liberation' from their dictionary, intellect, 
agenda, and even their memory.  Besides, Arabism, pan-Arabism, 
unity or anything in this regard must be eliminated and replaced 
with concession, surrender, submission, and reality under the 
pretext of modernization, rationale and the balance of power ... 
A memory has to be drilled and later erased.  Minds, hearts, and 
passions have to be replaced.  Skin has to be extracted, books 
and heritage and all that has to do with genuineness and Arab 
civilization should be destroyed, similar to what happened to 
Iraq's museums and libraries.  We are expected to replace this in 
order to present our credentials for the new American era in a 
world where its security has become the security of Israel, its 
life is Israel's life, and its future is Israel's future, as 
Condoleeza and others believe ..." 
 
¶4.  NOTING THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE U.S. TONE TOWARDS SYRIA, ABU 
DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED 5/05: 
 
"THE SUDDEN CHANGE OF TONE BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND SYRIA, WHICH 
CHANGED FROM THAT OF A DEBATE AND MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING TO THAT OF 
THREATS AND INTIMIDATIONS THROUGH THE MEDIA IS VERY REGRETTABLE 
... THE U.S. REALIZES THAT ANY NEW TREMORS IN THE REGION WILL 
HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES NOT ONLY ON PLANS FOR IRAQ BUT ALSO 
FOR PALESTINE AND THE MIDDLE EAST ..." 
 
¶5.  Commenting on Secretary Powell's visit to Syria and his 
demands, Sharjah-based pan-Arab daily "Al-Khaleej" editorialized 
5/04: 
 
"... As we thoroughly ponder these demands, we realize that these 
are issues that have nothing to do with the bilateral 
relationships between Syria and Lebanon on one hand and the U.S. 
on the other.  These issues are related to the Arab-Israeli 
conflict and directly to 'Israeli Security,' which has nothing to 
do with U.S. security, and the U.S. has summed up the world's 
security as 'Israeli security.'  Powell's visit is to achieve 
this goal, which is to remove all factors threatening the 
security of the Zionists, and this is also one of the major 
reasons for the occupation of Iraq.  So saying that the major aim 
for the U.S. war against Iraq was on behalf of Israel is not far 
from the truth; it is the reason behind Powell's visit to 
Damascus and Beirut ..." 
 
¶6.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "POWELL AND HIS ISRAELI AGENDA," "AL- 
KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 5/03: 
 
"... SYRIA REALIZES THAT THEY FACE DANGERS, CHALLENGES, AND 
DIRECT PRESSURES, BUT THEY ALSO REALIZE THAT THEY CAN'T FORGET 
THEIR UNCHANGEABLE PATRIOTIC NATIONALISM RELATED TO THEIR LAND 
AND THEIR RIGHTS, BECAUSE IF THIS HAPPENS, IT MEANS ITS (SYRIA) 
DOWNFALL AND SURRENDER ..." 
 
¶7.  CLAIMING WASHINGTON IS COMMITTING A NUMBER OF MISTAKES WITH 
THE NEW PALESTINIAN GOVERNMENT, DUBAI-BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED 
ARABIC DAILY "AL-BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 5/03: 
 
"... WASHINGTON, WITH ITS FOCUS ON ABU MAZEN THAT REACHES AN 
EXTENT OF 'POLISHING' IN AN EFFORT TO REMOVE ARAFAT FROM THE 
POLITICAL SCENE, IS GIVING THE WRONG SIGNS TO THE PALESTINIANS 
AND IS MAKING THEM SKEPTICAL OF THE NEW PRIME MINISTER'S REAL 
MISSION THAT PUSHES THEM TO ENCIRCLE HIM INTERNALLY ...  ADDED TO 
THAT, PALESTINE IS NOT AN ISSUE OF A PERSON OR AN AUTHORITY, IT 
IS CONNECTED TO THE INTERNATIONAL DECISIONS THAT SHOULD BE 
IMPLEMENTED WITH NO EDITING OR TRICKS, IN ORDER FOR THIS ARAB 
LAND TO BE LIBERATED AND FOR THE MIDDLE EAST TO BECOME STABLE 
..." 
¶8.  REFLECTING ON POWELL'S STATEMENT FOLLOWING THE "MASSACRE" 
COMMITTED IN GAZA YESTERDAY, "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIALIZED 5/03: 
 
"... SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL'S RESPONSE TO THE ISRAELI 
INTENSIFICATION IN GAZA YESTERDAY CONFIRMS THAT 'THE ROADMAP WILL 
BE IMPLEMENTED AS IS AND IN TIME.'  AND HIS INVITATION 'TO EXCEED 
THE SUICIDAL ATTACKS AND THE REVENGE OPERATIONS' EXPLAINS THE WAY 
TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN PALESTINE AND THE REGION ... POWELL'S 
COMMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE AND SYMBOLIZE A GOOD IDEA OF THE WAY TO 
ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED GOALS.  WHOEVER WANTS PEACE SHOULD EXCEED 
THAT NEVER-ENDING WHIRLPOOL OF REVENGE AND VIOLENCE.  THE ROAD IS 
CLEAR AND REQUESTS SERIOUS INITIATIVES ..." 
 
¶9.  COMMENTING ON ISRAEL'S RESPONSE TO THE "ROADMAP," ABU DHABI- 
BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL ARAB" EDITORIALIZED ON 5/02: 
 
"... IF THE U.S. IS SERIOUS ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THE 'ROADMAP,' AND 
ITS CREDIBILITY IS NOW AT STAKE, THEN IT (THE U.S.) SHOULD 
ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT IT (THE ROADMAP) WITHOUT ANY INTERFERENCE OR 
MODIFICATION AND WITHIN A SPECIFIC TIME SPAN ..." 
 
¶10.  IMPLICATING ISRAELI PM ARIEL SHARON FOR THE 'MASSACRES' 
COMMITTED IN PALESTINE, "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 5/02: 
 
"... WHOEVER BETS ON AMERICAN PRESSURE ON ISRAEL ... IS ONLY 
LIVING IN ANOTHER WORLD, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE AMERICAN VIOLENCE 
IN IRAQ SIMILAR IN GOALS TO THAT OF ZIONIST VIOLENCE IN 
PALESTINE.  IT IS THE SEASON OF MASSACRES AGAINST ARABS, AND THE 
POLITICAL CRUMBS THAT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED ARE ONLY PART OF A 
COMEDY THAT SUCCEEDED IN THE PAST.  THE BETS ARE STILL ON 
REGARDING THE SUCCESS OF ITS (THE COMEDY) NEW CHAPTERS."
