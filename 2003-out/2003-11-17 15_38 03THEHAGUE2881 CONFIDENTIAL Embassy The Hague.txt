(C) PolMilOff delivered ref A points to Dutch MFA 
Nonproliferation Chief Paul Wilke on November 17.  Wilke said 
the GONL fully agrees with the U.S. on the substance of the 
November 10 ElBaradei report.  As reported ref B, the Dutch 
continue to place a premium on arriving at a common EU 
position while preserving transatlantic consensus. 
Concerning next steps, Wilke understood the EU3 were working 
on a draft resolution and that this would be difficult to 
pull off the table the moment it surfaced.  He did not think 
sending ElBaradei's report to the Security Council for 
"information" was a good idea because for the Iranians it 
would amount "materially" to the same thing as a 
noncompliance report to the UNSC.  That said, Wilke thought 
that suggesting such a move might be useful as a bargaining 
chip with the EU3 in that it might be dropped in exchange for 
their dropping a resolution that falls short of 
noncompliance.  Wilke said he did not see any practical use 
in such a resolution at this time.  He thought pursuing a 
noncompliance resolution in March may be worth doing. 
Finally, he noted his office had been briefed by the Dutch 
military intelligence agency (MIVD) on the Iran nuclear issue 
and "it doesn't look like a civilian nuclear program."
