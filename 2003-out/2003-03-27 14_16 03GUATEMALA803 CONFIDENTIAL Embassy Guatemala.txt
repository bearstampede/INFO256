Jorge Perez on March 26 to reconfirm the GOG's commitment of 
March 25 to vote against a special sitting on Iraq at the 
59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.  DCM noted 
that the Guatemalan Mission in Geneva had informed our 
mission that they did not have instructions on this vote.

Geneva on March 26 to isntruct him to support the U.S. 
position.  Perez said he had reconfirmed this approach with 
Foreign Minister Gutierrez.

Multilateral Affairs Director Giovanni Castillo on March 26.

confirm with the Guatemalan Mission that they do in fact have 
such instructions.
