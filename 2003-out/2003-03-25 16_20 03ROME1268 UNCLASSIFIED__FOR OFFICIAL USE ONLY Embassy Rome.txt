SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) G8 MEMBER STATES DID NOT REACH CONSENSUS ON A 
COMMON TEXT FOR PRESENTATION. OPPOSITION TO A U.S.-FRENCH 
DRAFT WAS LED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION 
AND CANADA, WHO FAVOR PRESENTATION OF A LOWEST COMMON 
DENOMINATOR TEXT (REPRODUCED BELOW). THE U.S.- FRENCH DRAFT 
RECEIVED GENERAL SUPPORT ON TWO MAJOR HEADINGS: I) 
PREVENTION AND ACTION AGAINST THE CAUSES OF FAMINE; AND III) 
COMMITMENT TO INSURE LONG-TERM FOOD SECURITY. LESSER SUPPORT 
WAS GARNERED FOR: II) FLEXIBLE APPROACHES TO FAMINE E.G., 
SCHOOL FEEDING, TWINNING, MICRO-LEVEL ASSISTANCE, CASH-FOR- 
WORK, AND MARKET DISTRIBUTION. THE FRENCH AND U.S. CO-CHAIRS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01268  01 OF 05  251628Z 
AGREED TO SEND BOTH THE UK TEXT AND THE U.S.- FRENCH TEXT 
ALONG TO THE G8 SOUS SHERPAS (FASS), APPENDING THE SPECIFIC 
OBJECTIONS AND CAVEATS RAISED BY THE VARIOUS DELEGATIONS. 
END SUMMARY.

BACKGROUND

¶2. (SBU) FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO THE FAO, CLAUDE CHEREAU, 
CONVENED A WRAP UP MEETING ON 03/25 TO DISCUSS THE REVISED 
U.S.- FRENCH DRAFTED END FAMINE MEASURES BEING FORWARDED TO 
THE G8 FOREIGN AFFAIRS SOUS SHERPAS (FASS) FOR THEIR MEETING 
ON MARCH 27-28. IN INITIAL INTERVENTIONS, THE UNITED 
KINGDOM, EUROPEAN COMMISSION (AND TO A GREAT DEGREE CANADA) 
RAISED SUBSTANTIVE OBJECTIONS TO BOTH THE SCOPE AND TENOR OF 
THE U.S.- FRENCH DRAFT. THE UK THEN PROPOSED A "COUNTER 
TEXT" WHICH IS HEREWITH REPRODUCED.

¶3. (SBU) "THE G8 REPRESENTATIVES IN ROME HAVE CONSIDERED 
WHAT FURTHER ACTIONS MIGHT BE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE SERIOUS 
PROBLEMS OF FAMINE IN AFRICA.  THEY HAVE LISTENED VERY 
CAREFULLY TO PRESENTATIONS FROM THE THREE ROME-BASED UN 
AGENCIES (FAO, IFAD AND WFP) AND SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING PAPER 
TO FASS. 
 
THE G8 REPRESENTATIVES IN ROME ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH THE

CURRENT FOOD CRISIS IN THE AFRICAN CONTINENT AND UNDERLINE 
THE COMMITMENT OF G8 COUNTRIES TO RESPOND GENEROUSLY TO 
CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS.  WHILE THE G8 REPRESENTATIVES IN 
ROME RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR URGENT ACTION, THEY EMPHASIZE AT 
THE SAME TIME THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF FAMINE. 
THE G8 REPRESENTATIVES IN ROME RECOGNIZE THE AFRICA ACTION 
PLAN AS THE MAIN BASIS FOR G8 ACTION TO ADDRESS LONG-TERM 
FOOD SECURITY IN AFRICA.  FUTURE ACTIONS SHOULD BE GUIDED BY 
THE IMPLEMENTATION REPORT TO BE PRESENTED DURING THE SUMMIT 
OF EVIAN.  THESE ACTIONS SHOULD BE FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE 
NEPAD INITIATIVE. 
 
THE G8 REPRESENTATIVES IN ROME NOTE THAT MANY OF THE LONGER- 
TERM ACTIONS TO AVOID FAMINE PROPOSED BY FAO, IFAD AND WFP 
ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE AFRICA ACTION PLAN.  HOWEVER, 
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL ATTENTION TO IMPROVE 
SOME ASPECTS OF SHORT-TERM EMERGENCY RESPONSES.  IN

¶5. (SBU) BEGIN TEXT. "IN 2003, 38 MILLION PEOPLE IN SUB- 
SAHARAN AFRICA ARE AT RISK OF STARVATION.  THE POTENTIAL FOR 
WIDESPREAD FAMINE IS WITHOUT PRECEDENT, DUE TO CHRONIC 
POVERTY, HIV/AIDS, CONFLICT, ERRATIC CLIMATE CONDITIONS, 
LACK OF SUPPORT FOR AGRICULTURE, NATURAL DISASTERS AND POOR 
GOVERNANCE.  THE G8 SEEKS TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 
THEIR AID BY CONCENTRATING ON KEY PRIORITIES AND PROPOSING 
CONCRETE ACTION. 
 
¶I. PREVENTION AND ACTION AGAINST THE CAUSES OF FAMINE 
 
I) EARLY WARNING: IT IS ESSENTIAL TO INCREASE FOCUS ON THE 
PREVENTION OF FAMINE.  THEREFORE, THE G8 RECOMMENDS 
REVIEWING AND IMPROVING EARLY WARNING AND FORECAST SYSTEMS, 
AND CONTINGENCY PLANS, AT THE NATIONAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS. 
WE STRONGLY SUPPORT REGIONAL EFFORTS IN THIS AREA, SUCH AS 
THE REASCO INITIATIVE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA WITH SADC AND THE 
SUCCESSFUL MODEL OF THE CILSS (COMITE INTERGOUVERNEMENTAL DE 
LUTTE CONTRE LA SECHERESSE AU SAHEL IN WEST AFRICA).  WE 
SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMON TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR

CARRYING OUT FOOD SECURITY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, INCLUDING 
AGREEMENT ON "PRE-FAMINE INDICATORS" TO TRIGGER A RESPONSE 
AT THE OUTSET OF A CRISIS.  IN ADDITION TO AGRICULTURAL 
INDICATORS, NUTRITIONAL STATUS MEASURES SHOULD BE INTEGRATED 
INTO THE ASSESSMENTS, PERFORMED BY WFP, FAO, UNICEF, 
BILATERAL AGENCIES, REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND STRENGTHENED 
NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. IN PARTICULAR, WE ENCOURAGE THE UN 
AGENCIES TO PRIORITIZE ASSISTANCE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 
NATIONWIDE NUTRITION SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS IN DISASTER-PRONE 
COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT AFRICA. 
 
II) HIV/AIDS: MEASURES ARE REQUIRED TO TACKLE THE IMPACT OF 
HIV/AIDS THROUGH IMPROVED NUTRITIONAL TARGETING, ACCESS TO 
AFFORDABLE CARE AND TREATMENT, AND SOCIAL PROTECTION 
PROGRAMMES.  WE ENCOURAGE DONORS AND UN AGENCIES TO WORK 
WITH AFFECTED GOVERNMENTS TO TACKLE THE LOSS OF HUMAN 
CAPACITY AND SKILLS THROUGH HIV/AIDS, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN 
VIABLE RURAL LIVELIHOODS.  SPECIFICALLY, FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS 
SHOULD BE USED TO DISSEMINATE VACCINATIONS, INFORMATION ON 
AIDS AWARENESS, HEALTH AND NUTRITION.  FOOD BASKETS TO

RECIPIENTS SHOULD INCLUDE ENHANCED MICRONUTRIENTS AND 
PROTEIN FOR HIV POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS.  ADDITIONALLY, 
MEASURES SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED TO INCORPORATE HIV/AIDS 
INDICATORS IN ASSESSMENTS OF FOOD SECURITY AND 
VULNERABILITY.  GIVEN THAT WOMEN PRODUCE 80 PERCENT OF THE 
FOOD, AS WELL AS PREPARING AND SERVING IT, SOLUTIONS ARE 
NEEDED TO HELP WOMEN WEAKENED BY HIV CONTINUE TO PERFORM 
THESE FUNCTIONS. 
 
III) NON-FOOD INPUTS: UN CONSOLIDATED APPEALS INCLUDE NON- 
FOOD ITEMS FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE - SEEDS, TOOLS, VACCINES, 
MEDICINE, SCHOOL SUPPLIES, TENTS, ETC.  THE G8 COUNTRIES 
SHOULD WORK WITH OTHER DONORS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE NEEDS 
ARE MET, GIVEN THEIR ROLE IN OVERCOMING THE IMMEDIATE 
CRISIS. 
 
IV) TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: G8 COUNTRIES WILL CONTINUE TO WORK 
TO HELP FOOD INSECURE COUNTRIES RECEIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE 
AND MAKE INFORMED CHOICES TO PROMOTE THEIR FOOD SECURITY. 
WE RENEW OUR COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT THE NEW PARTNERSHIP FOR 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT (NEPAD) TO ENSURE THAT NO COUNTRY 
GENUINELY COMMITTED TO POVERTY REDUCTION, GOOD GOVERNANCE 
AND ECONOMIC REFORM WILL BE DENIED THE CHANCE TO ACHIEVE THE 
MILLENIUM GOALS.  IN EMERGENCIES, GREATER TECHNICAL 
COORDINATION IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT OPTIMUM USE IS MADE 
OF EXISTING LOGISTIC RESOURCES AND COMMERCIAL NETWORKS. 
 
II.  FLEXIBLE APPROACHES TO FAMINE. NOTE: THIS SECTION OF 
TEXT IS BRACKETED, AS THERE WAS LACK OF GENERAL CONSENSUS. 
END NOTE. 
 
[(I) SCHOOL FEEDING: SCHOOL FEEDING PROGRAMS HELP GET POOR 
CHILDREN INTO SCHOOL, HELP THEM STAY IN SCHOOL AND HELP THEM 
LEARN WHILE THEY ARE THERE.  MANY AGREE THAT THIS SINGLE 
INTERVENTION IS CRUCIAL TO ADDRESSING THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG- 
TERM CRISES.  IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING ESSENTIAL NUTRITION, 
THEY INCREASE ENROLMENT AND ATTENDANCE AND PROVIDE A 
PIPELINE FOR THE DELIVERY OF OTHER NECESSARY INPUTS, SUCH AS 
DE-WORMING INTERVENTIONS, VACCINES AND AWARENESS PROGRAMS 
FOR PARENTS.  THESE PROGRAMMES NEED TO BE INTEGRATED INTO 
THE PRIORITIES AND RELEVANT SECTOR POLICIES OF NATIONAL 
GOVERNMENTS, AND COORDINATED WITH OTHER UN AGENCIES, IN 
ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF THE EDUCATION FOR ALL 
INITIATIVE. 
 
II) TWINNING: THE G8 ENCOURAGES WFP'S ESTABLISHMENT OF 
PROCEDURES FOR TWINNING BETWEEN THOSE NON-TRADITIONAL DONORS 
WHO HAVE FOOD STOCKS BUT CANNOT PAY FOR TRANSPORT AND THOSE 
DONORS WHO ARE ABLE TO COVER THESE COSTS.  THESE GUIDELINES 
MUST DEFINE SPECIFIC CRITERIA FOR ITS USE AND SHOULD INCLUDE 
A DEDICATED FUND TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS.

PAGE 04        ROME  01268  03 OF 05  251629Z 
 
III) MICRO-LEVEL ASSISTANCE: SPECIFIC INITIATIVES SHOULD 
PROVIDE CASH ASSISTANCE TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, 
ESPECIALLY WOMEN, AFTER THE FIRST INDICATIONS OF A POTENTIAL 
FAMINE SITUATION.  ADDITIONALLY, DONORS AND UN AGENCIES 
SHOULD WORK TO STRENGTHEN SMALL, COMMUNITY-BASED GROUPS IN 
DISASTER-PRONE AREAS. 
 
IV) CASH-FOR-WORK:  CASH-FOR-WORK PROGRAMS ALLOW GOVERNMENTS 
TO USE ASSISTANCE MONIES TO PAY PEOPLE TO WORK (SUCH AS IN 
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES LIKE PLANTING, 
IRRIGATION OR ROAD CONSTRUCTIONS) AND CAN BE A PARTICULARLY 
APPROPRIATE TOOL IN CASES WHERE FOOD IS AVAILABLE, BUT THE 
POPULATION DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO PURCHASE. 
FOOD AID SHOULD BE PROVIDED AS APPROPRIATE. PREVENTION 
DEPENDS ON BETTER CO-ORDINATION AND COHERENCE BETWEEN 
MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS, NGO'S AND GOVERNMENTS OF THE 
AFFECTED COUNTRIES AND IMPROVING LOCAL MARKETS THROUGH 
REGIONAL CO-OPERATION.  THESE PROGRAMS, ALONG WITH FOOD-FOR- 
WORK, STRENGTHEN LOCAL LEADERSHIP AND STRUCTURES AND IMPROVE

V) MARKET DISTRIBUTION: G8 COUNTRIES SHOULD INCREASE THE USE 
OF "MARKET DISTRIBUTION" OF FOOD AID IN FAMINE PREVENTION 
INITIATIVES.  MARKET DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES ARE DEFINED AS 
THE CONTROLLED SALE OF FOOD COMMODITIES INTO MARKETS THAT 
HAVE LOST, OR WILL LOSE, THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE 
COMMODITIES TO THE LOCAL POPULATION.  EFFORTS SHOULD ALSO BE 
MADE TO IMPROVE THE NATIONAL CAPACITY OF COUNTRIES TO IMPORT 
FOOD ON TIME TO WHERE IT IS NEEDED.] 
 
III. COMMITMENT TO INSURE LONG-TERM FOOD SECURITY 
 
I) REINVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT: THERE IS AN 
URGENT NEED TO REVERSE THE TREND IN LACK OF INVESTMENT AND 
DISINVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, 
BOTH THROUGH BILATERAL DONORS, AS WELL AS THROUGH THE MULTI- 
LATERAL LENDING INSTITUTIONS.  THIS INCLUDES HELPING TO 
CREATE A SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR, 
IMPROVING WIDER EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND IMPLEMENTING 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01268  04 OF 05  251630Z 
ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES AND OPEN DEMOCRATIC 
SYSTEMS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A CONSTRUCTIVE 
DIALOGUE WITH OUR AFRICAN PARTNERS TO SUPPORT THE OBJECTIVES 
OF THE NEPAD. 
 
II) HUMAN RESOURCE REPLENISHMENT: IN THE FACE OF AIDS, 
AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS ARE LOSING THE CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT 
PROGRAMS TO BENEFIT THEIR POPULATIONS.  CREATIVE MEASURES 
SHOULD BE TAKEN TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS ON A ONE-ON- 
ONE BASIS TO ENHANCE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES (I.E. PEACE CORPS, FARMER-TO-FARMER, UN 
VOLUNTEERS, LELAND HUNGER FELLOWS, SISTER CITIES, ETC.). 
ADDITIONALLY, EXPATRIATES OF SPECIFIC COUNTRIES SHOULD BE 
ENCOURAGED TO ASSIST THEIR COUNTRIES THROUGH MORE THAN JUST 
REMITTANCES. 
 
III) WATER IN AGRICULTURE: EFFORTS SHOULD BE EXPANDED BY FAO 
AND OTHERS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF WATER USAGE FOR 
AGRICULTURE.  IMPROVEMENTS TO SMALL-SCALE IRRIGATION, WATER 
HARVESTING SYSTEMS, LOW-COST PUMPS, SMALL DAM PROGRAMS AND 
PRECISION IRRIGATION SHOULD BE PURSUED WITH NATIONAL 
GOVERNMENTS.  MAJOR RIVER BASIN STUDIES ON THE USE OF WATER 
RESOURCES IN AFRICA SHOULD BE COMPLETED WITH DISPATCH AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTED. 
 
IV) HIV/AIDS: ENHANCED ACTION AGAINST THE HIV/AIDS PANDEMIC 
IS NEEDED, INCLUDING ADDRESSING THE PLIGHT OF ORPHANS AND 
OTHER VULNERABLE GROUPS AND THE LOSS OF HUMAN SKILLS AND 
CAPACITY.  EFFORTS TO SUPPORT EDUCATION AND AIDS AWARENESS, 
WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON GIRLS AND WOMEN, SHOULD BE ENHANCED. 
MICRO-ENTERPRISE PROJECTS SHOULD FOCUS ESPECIALLY ON WOMEN, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01268  04 OF 05  251630Z 
AS THEY ARE THE KEY FOOD PROVIDERS AND THE KEY TO FIGHTING 
AIDS.  G8 COUNTRIES AND UN AGENCIES ARE URGED TO BECOME 
FORCEFUL ADVOCATES WITH NATIONAL LEADERS, PARLIAMENTARIANS 
AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP POLICIES TO SUPPORT 
ORPHANS AND STRENGTHEN PROTECTION FOR WOMEN. 
 
V) AGRICULTURE SCIENCE: THE G8 SHOULD PROVIDE MORE RESEARCH, 
TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY AND BEST PRACTICES TO IMPROVE 
AGRICULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE.  G8 COUNTRIES SHOULD REDOUBLE 
THEIR EFFORTS TO INCREASE AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION IN 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THE LEAST DEVELOPED, 
THROUGH IMPROVED POLICY FRAMEWORKS AND ADDITIONAL 
AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ASSISTANCE, INCLUDING 
BIOTECHNOLOGY.  WE ENCOURAGE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS 
UNIVERSITIES, FOCUSED ON AGRICULTURE TO CULTIVATE CURRENT 
AND DEVELOP NEW PARTNERSHIPS WITH SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS IN 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. 
 
VI) INFRASTRUCTURE:  CONTINUED EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED ON 
BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO CARRY PRODUCTS TO

PAGE 03        ROME  01268  05 OF 05  251630Z 
PREFER A "MINIMALIST" APPROACH TO PROPOSALS DIRECTED AT 
COMBATING FAMINE. THEY ARE RETICENT TO BE SEEN AS AHEAD OF 
THE CURVE IN ENDORSING ANY CONCEPT THAT HAS NOT BEEN 
PREVIOUSLY VETTED AND APPROVED IN OTHER FORA. WHEN ASKED TO 
SUPPORT THE UK DOCUMENT, I REFUSED BECAUSE, BEING SO 
"WATERED DOWN," IT SIMPLY DID NOT ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS WE 
SET OUT TO ACHIEVE. FORTUNATELY, OUR FRENCH CO-CHAIR, 
AMBASSADOR CHEREAU SIDED WITH US AND SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO ENSURE THAT BOTH DOCUMENTS WOULD BE FORWARDED - LEAVING 
IT FOR THE SOUS SHERPAS TO SEPARATE THE "WHEAT FROM THE 
CHAFF." 
 
¶7. (SBU) IN GENERAL, JAPAN AND ITALY WERE MOSTLY SUPPORTIVE 
OF THE U.S.- FRENCH DRAFT. GERMANY AND THE RUSSIAN 
FEDERATION WERE ALSO SUPPORTIVE WITH SOME "QUALIFIERS." THE 
EUROPEAN COMMISSION WAS ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THE ENTIRE 
U.S.-FRENCH TEXT, WHICH SURPRISED THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR WHO 
COMMENTED THAT HE WAS HEARING A "DIFFERENT SOUND" FROM 
BRUSSELS. FINALLY, THE UK AND CANADA DUG IN ON "LESSER IS 
BETTER." NOTE: CANADA'S AMBASSADOR BOB FOWLER WAS NOT 
PRESENT AT TODAY'S MEETING. END NOTE. 
 
¶8. (U) THE WFP 2003 FOOD NEEDS AND COMMITMENT ANALYSIS WILL 
BE SENT VIA E-MAIL TO STATE/IO AND STATE/E. HALL
