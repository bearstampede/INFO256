SUBJECT: PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION OUTSIDE EMBASSY TEGUCIGALPA 
REGARDING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF FATHER JIM CARNEY 
 
 
On September 17 approximately 100 demonstrators, mostly from 
the Popular Block, gathered peacefully outside the Embassy to 
protest the lack of information over the disappearance of 
leftist Jesuit priest, Father Jim Carney, (aka Father 
Guadalupe) in 1982-83.  Father Guadalupe left the U.S. to 
come live and work with leftist guerrillas in Honduras.  The 
demonstration was led by Joseph Connolly, brother-in-law of 
Father Guadalupe, who is also a U.S. citizen.  Mr. Connolly 
delivered a letter addressed to the Ambassador demanding the 
Embassy release any documents it has relating to the priest's 
disappearance.  Mr. Connolly then delivered an anti-U.S. 
speech to the crowed and led them in anti-U.S. slogans.
