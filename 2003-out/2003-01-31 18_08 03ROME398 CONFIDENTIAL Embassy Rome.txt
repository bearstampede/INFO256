CLASSIFIED BY: EMIL SKODON, DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION, FOR REASONS 
1.5 (D) AND (E). 
 
¶1.  (U) PA ITALY HAS FOCUSED CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES ON 
BIOTECH ISSUES OVER THE PAST YEAR, SPONSORING SPEAKER 
PROGRAMS, DVCS, ROUNDTABLES, SEMINARS, INTERNATIONAL AND 
VOLUNTARY VISITOR PROJECTS, PRESS INTERVIEWS, OP-ED PIECES, 
AND OTHER PUBLIC DIPLOMACY ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO PROMOTE 
U.S. BIOTECH INTERESTS IN ITALY.  THIS IS ONE OF OUR HIGHEST 
PRIORITIES, AND WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TRANSMITTING OUR 
MESSAGE TO ITALIAN POLICY MAKERS AND OPINION LEADERS. 
 
¶2.  (C) WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT GIVEN THE CURRENT CRISIS IN 
IRAQ, IT WILL BE UNTIMELY TO MOUNT A HIGH PROFILE PUBLIC 
DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN IN ITALY TO PROMOTE A WTO CASE AGAINST THE 
EUROPEAN UNION OVER ITS MORATORIUM ON APPROVALS OF BIOTECH 
FOOD PRODUCTS.  THE BULK OF OUR PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT IN 
THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME MUST FOCUS ON PROMOTING U.S. 
POLICY IN IRAQ AND GAINING ITALIAN PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR IT.  WE 
ARE CONCERNED THAT IF WE ARE ENGAGED IN THIS EFFORT AT THE 
SAME TIME THAT WE ARE PUBLICLY PROMOTING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST 
THE EUROPEAN UNION OVER BIOTECH FOOD PRODUCTS (A VERY 
SENSITIVE ISSUE IN ITALY), WE COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO 
INCREASE ITALIAN PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR OUR ACTIONS IN IRAQ. 
WHILE U.S. IRAQ POLICY AND U.S. BIOTECH FOOD POLICY ARE NOT 
LOGICALLY RELATED, OUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT THE ITALIAN PRESS 
AND PUBLIC WILL MAKE A CONNECTION THAT COULD BE TO THE 
DETRIMENT OF OUR EFFORTS AT THIS CRITICAL TIME.  WE SHOULD 
SEEK TO SLAY ONLY ONE DRAGON AT A TIME. 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

¶3.  (C) WE SHOULD THEREFORE PROCEED INCREMENTALLY IN OUR 
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN TO SUPPORT THE USG CASE IN THE WTO 
AGAINST THE EUROPEAN UNION OVER THE MORATORIUM; WE SHOULD 
TARGET SPECIFIC POLICY MAKERS AND OPINION LEADERS FIRST, 
RATHER THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC.  THE MOST EFFECTIVE PUBLIC 
DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN FOR SUCH A TARGETED AUDIENCE WOULD FOCUS 
AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE ON THE LEGAL BASIS OF THE USG CASE, 
I.E., ON THE ILLEGAL NATURE OF THE MORATORIUM.  THUS THE 
FIRST TWO OF THE SEVEN BROAD MESSAGES OUTLINED IN REFTEL 
WOULD BE THE MOST USEFUL IN ITALY IN THE NEAR TERM: THAT THE 
MORATORIUM ON APPROVALS OF BIOTECH FOOD PRODUCTS VIOLATES 
COMMITMENTS MADE BY THE EU IN THE WTO; AND THAT THE U.S. IS 
SIMPLY SEEKING SCIENTIFIC, RULES-BASED REVIEW OF 
APPLICATIONS, NOT FORCING ACCEPTANCE OF BIOTECH FOODS ON 
EUROPEAN CONSUMERS.  WE KNOW ITALIAN POLICY MAKERS AND 
OPINION LEADERS ("VALIDATORS") WHO WOULD SUPPORT US IN THESE 
ARGUMENTS. 
 
¶4.  (C) THE REMAINING FIVE BROAD MESSAGES (PARAGRAPH 3C-G IN 
REFTEL), FOCUSING ON WHAT SOME ITALIAN OPINION LEADERS REGARD 
AS SUBSIDIARY ISSUES, WOULD BE MUCH LESS EFFECTIVE WITH THAT 
AUDIENCE.  WE WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY IDENTIFYING INFLUENTIAL 
ITALIAN "VALIDATORS" TO SUPPORT THEM AND WE ARE THEREFORE 
INCLINED TO USE THEM SPARINGLY IN OUR TARGETED PUBLIC 
DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN.  WHEN THE HEAT IS OFF THE IRAQ CRISIS AND 
WE CAN USEFULLY RESUME A BROADER-BASED PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
CAMPAIGN, ISSUE C (FAMINE IN AFRICA) HAS PARTICULAR RESONANCE 
WITH ITALIAN POLITICAL LEADERS AND THE PUBLIC.  PM BERLUSCONI 
HAS EXPRESSED PERSONAL INTEREST IN THIS THEME TO OUR 
AMBASSADORS TO ITALY, THE VATICAN, AND THE FAO.

¶5.  (U) WE ARE CURRENTLY IDENTIFYING ITALIAN PARLIAMENTARIANS 
FOR A BIOTECH VOLUNTARY VISITOR PROGRAM AND WOULD WELCOME 
FUNDING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $25,000 TO ALLOW 
TEN PARLIAMENTARIANS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM.  WE WILL 
ALSO ORGANIZE WITHIN TWO MONTHS U.S. SPEAKER PROGRAMS IN 
MILAN, NAPLES, AND ROME IN SUPPORT OF U.S. BIOTECH POLICY. 
WE WOULD EAGERLY ACCEPT DVCS WITH HIGH-LEVEL USG OFFICIALS 
(SUCH AS USTR ZOELLICK AND U/S LARSON) AS SOON AS A DECISION 
IS MADE TO PROCEED WITH THE WTO CASE.
