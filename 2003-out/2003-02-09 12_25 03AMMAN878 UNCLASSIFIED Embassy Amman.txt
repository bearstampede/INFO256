SUBJECT: Request for a DVC Series on the Arts 
 
REF: AMMAN 05768 
 
¶1. Summary: Post would like to request IIP's support in 
organizing a new series of DVCs on the Arts for FY 2003. 
The series will be conducted in coordination with the newly 
established College of Arts and Design at the University of 
Jordan and will serve to educate and introduce the students 
at the college to alternative approaches to music, visual 
art and theater.  The initiation of the college is a 
milestone for the exchange of ideas and culture between 
Jordan and the U.S. and will broaden Post's contact with 
youth and the next generation of Jordanian artists and 
musicians. 
 
¶2. PAS recommends the DVC series consist of eight programs 
to be covered in two months, a program every two weeks. The 
university has already selected speakers for five of the 
eight programs, the contact information of which is below. 
Each DVC will last 75 minutes and will be conducted at the 
University of Jordan.
