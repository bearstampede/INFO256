SUBJECT:  UAEG DOWNGRADES REPRESENTATION TO THE THIRD 
GLOBAL FORUM DUE TO SARS; NOTIFIED OF U.S. PARTICIPATION 
 
REFS:  A) ABU DHABI 2081  B) STATE 125551  C) STATE 103851 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Charge d'Affaires Richard A. 
Albright, for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C) Despite earlier indications to the contrary (ref 
A), the UAE Justice Ministry notified Post 5/14 that the 
Minister and his staff would not/not attend the Third 
Global Forum on Fighting Corruption.  When queried by 
Poloff 5/17, UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs Deputy 
Director of Legal Affairs Yacub Al-Hosani intimated that 
many UAE officials (including the Justice Minister) are 
unwilling to travel to Korea right now because of the SARS 
virus.  He confirmed, however, that while the UAEG would 
not be represented at the Forum at the ministerial-level, 
someone of Ambassadorial rank -- possibly the UAE 
Ambassador to Korea -- would attend. 
 
¶3.  (C) Post also confirmed to the UAE Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs via diplomatic note 5/14 that Secretary of Commerce 
Donald Evans will head the U.S. delegation to the Third 
Global Forum on Fighting Corruption (ref B).  We also 
conveyed the information to our colleagues at the Korean 
Embassy in Abu Dhabi.
