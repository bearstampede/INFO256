  ¶1.   Under headline "Save generations from scourge of 
      war" the pro-government daily "The Daily Mirror" 
      dedicated its March 13 editorial to discouraging the 
      United States from attacking Iraq, saying, "the 
      unilateral use of force against Iraq is illegitimate 
      under international law."  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .But who really is for war against anything 
      at this moment in time?  Very few, if reports around 
      the world are anything to go by.  The majority of the 
      people have said `NO' to war in order `to save 
      succeeding generations from the scourge of war. . .' 
      American presidents, going back to Franklin Roosevelt, 
      have dismissed anti-war protests, much like George W. 
      Bush did in declaring he wouldn't be swayed by millions 
      of people around the world who gathered last month to 
      protest a looming American-led invasion of Iraq. . . 
      It is our well-considered view that leaping into a war, 
      an unjustifiable war, is tantamount to telling the 
      whole world to go to hell!."
