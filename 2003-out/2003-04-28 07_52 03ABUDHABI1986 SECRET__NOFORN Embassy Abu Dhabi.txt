REF: STATE 98747 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador M. Wahba, for reasons 1.5 (b) 
and (d). 
 
¶2.  (S) On April 22 the Ambassador conveyed points in reftel 
under cover of a personal letter addressed to MFA A/USEC for 
Political Affairs Abdullah Rashid Al-Nuaimi and passed him the 
list of wanted Iraqi regime officials.  Based on comments from 
other senior UAE officials, we have been assured that Iraqis 
require visas for entry to the UAE and the UAEG has absolutely 
no/no desire to allow former Iraqi regime officials to transit, 
enter or reside in the Emirates. 
 
¶3.  (S/NF) Reftel names have been passed by ORCA to liaison in 
both Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
