¶1. (U) Classified by DCM Richard Albright for reasons 1.5 (b) 
       and (d). 
 
¶2. (C) Summary and comment: Following his return from the WTO 
services negotiations in Geneva, UAE Ministry of Economy 
Director of WTO Affairs (and head of the UAE's delegation) 
Saeed Al-Nasibi confirmed to Econoff on March 15 that the 
UAE will submit an initial offer on services commitments -- 
but not by March 31 -- and is unlikely to consider 
liberalization of service sectors in the near future. Al-Nasibi 
also said that the UAEG would not support recent U.S. proposals 
on Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on Public Health and 
Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA).  Although Al- Nasibi 
articulated clearly the UAEG's position on these issues, he and 
his staff could benefit from a better understanding of our 
proposals and how they factor into the dynamics of WTO 
negotiations.  End summary and comment. 
 
 
UAE Will Not Open Services Sectors 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Al-Nasibi confirmed that the UAE will submit an initial 
GATS offer on services commitments, but "like almost everyone 
else in the WTO," will not meet the March 31 deadline.  Our 
interlocutor acknowledged the benefits of liberalization of 
services (per ref A), but said that the UAE is not ready for 
foreign competition. Despite calls for liberalization from 
business-minded Dubai, Al-Nasibi intimated that conservative 
elements within the Abu Dhabi Government opposed any moves 
to open most services sectors.  He speculated that financial 
services would be the first area the UAEG would eventually open 
to foreigners. 
 
No Support For U.S. Moratorium On TRIPs... 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (C) Al-Nasibi also confirmed that the UAE would not add its 
name to the list of countries to voluntarily "opt out" of the 
compulsory licensing mechanism should a public health crisis 
arise (ref B).  He noted that any solution under the Doha 
Declaration should be made available to all WTO members 
regardless of their development status; the UAE is not poor in 
terms of revenue, but has a great need to develop its domestic 
manufacturing capabilities.  Al-Nasibi also said that the U.S. 
definition of "public health crisis" is too narrow, and the UAEG 
should be allowed to determine its own public health situation 
and make vital medicines available to all. The UAE position -- 
which is congruent with the EU proposal on Paragraph 6, 
according to Al-Nasibi -- is that WTO Members should consult 
with the World Health Organization to find a permanent solution. 
 
 
...Or The U.S. Proposal On NAMA 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (C) In response to the U.S. proposal on non-agricultural 
market access submitted to the WTO in December (ref C), 
Al-Nasibi complained that the timetable for the reduction of 
tariffs to 5 percent by 2010, and elimination of tariffs by 
2015, was entirely too long.  The UAE already has an applied 
external tariff of 5 percent and is willing to reduce that 
further through multilateral negotiations and in conjunction 
with the GCC Customs Union.  While the UAEG supports the 
spirit of our proposal, Al-Nasibi said they could not support 
the current language and favor a more aggressive timetable for 
the elimination of non-agricultural tariffs.
