¶1.   (SBU) On March 20, 2003 Colombo Emergency Action 
  Committee (EAC) met to implement new security procedures due 
  to the onset of conflict in Iraq.  Ambassador chaired the 
  EAC. 
 
¶2.   (SBU) The EAC decided that effective tomorrow, all 
  American employees will be picked up from their residences 
  in Embassy LAVs.  The committee agreed to include three 
  USAID PSCs and one Embassy PSC in the LAV pick-up schedule. 
  A schedule of staggered pick-up and drop-off times was 
  distributed to all EAC members. 
 
¶3.   (SBU) The EAC recommended that all official American 
  dependants not attend school on Friday.  Due in part to the 
  large demonstration against the conflict scheduled to take 
  place, the school busses will not be used tomorrow. 
 
¶4.   (SBU) The Ambassador commented that the use of the LAVs 
  and the armed police officers currently assigned to every 
  U.S. residence are not optional.  They are mandatory. 
 
¶5.   (SBU) Travel to the Eastern part of Sri Lanka is 
  restricted effective today until the EAC can gauge public 
  sentiment in that part of the country. 
 
¶6.   (SBU) The EAC recommended that the Ambassador accept 
  the Police Special Task Force protective follow-car for 
  official moves.  The police are prepared to supplement the 
  Ambassador's protection by providing this measure.  The EAC 
  also recommended that the Ambassador not fly the U.S. flag 
  on his vehicle until further notice. 
 
¶7.   (SBU) The country clearance message was updated to note 
  the changes in the travel policy and to come into compliance 
  with reftel A. 
 
¶8.   (SBU) Consular Chief reported that the Consular section 
  issued a warden message consistent with the language 
  provided in reftel B. 
 
¶9.   (SBU) The EAC agreed to meet again as needed.
