BROADBAND FIXED WIRELESS MARKET IN CROATIA 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
A.Croatia has allocated an unlicensed frequency band 
of 2400-2483.5 MHz with limitation on Effective 
Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) equal to 100 mW, and 
5725-5875 MHz with EIRP equal to 25 mW.  There are no 
separate allocations for indoor and outdoor uses.  A 
license is required for the use of 3.5GHZ spectrum. 
 
B.The demand for BFW can be only roughly estimated. 
 Independent researchers estimate that 1.4 million 
n 
people in Croatia (out of total population of 4.3 
million) have Internet access.  According to the 
Institute for Telecommunications, which issues 
approvals for import of BFW units, thousands of such 
units have been imported into Croatia in the past three 
years, but there is no information on how many are used 
in commercial networks. 
 
C.An operating license is required for BFW services 
provided in the 3.5GHz spectrum.  Additionally, every 
Internet service provider must obtain a license from 
the Croatian Telecommunications Institute, located at:

BFW systems operating in the 2.4GHz range are not 
required to have a license provided that they meet the 
above frequency and EIRP requirements (see paragraph A) 
and that they are certified according to relevant ETSI 
(European Telecommunications Standardization Institute) 
technical specifications. 
 
 
D.There are no ownership limits for companies 
offering BFW services.  However, until 2005, the local 
incumbent operator, Hrvatske telekomunikacije, reserves 
the exclusive right to offer real time voice services. 
 
Â¶E. Every telecommunications operator offering 
interconnection has to publish its interconnection 
tariffs.  The tariffs have to be approved by the 
Croatian Telecommunications Institute. 
 
F.n/a 
 
G.Four out of eight Internet service providers in 
Croatia use commercial BFW networks to connect 
customers to the Internet or to link two different 
locations of the same customer.  Small range devices 
(SRD) are used by ISPs for connecting users in the 
urban areas.  Companies also use SRD for intranet 
networks.

I.Telecommunications technical equipment and 
installations can be imported, sold, leased, used or 
installed and connected to telecommunications 
infrastructure in Croatia if their quality is proven by 
a certificate of the Croatian Telecommunications 
Institute or statement of manufacturer's compatibility, 
which is submitted to the Croatian Telecommunications 
Institute, and a label as prescribed by separate 
e 
guidelines.  The Institute can accept certificates of 
quality or statements of compatibility from foreign 
legal entities as a valid proof of quality for the 
aforementioned equipment. 
 
Croatian regulations prescribe that the label required 
for equipment certified should be in accordance with 
European or Croatian standards, and it makes no 
distinction between the two standards. 
 
If the equipment is not certified, it can be either 
tested in Croatia or installed with prior consent from 
the Institute for testing purposes only and for a 
period not longer than two years. 
 
Microprocessors and personal computers can be imported 
free of customs duties, while duties for antennas 
imported from countries other than EU are 5 percent.  A 
value added tax of 22 percent is imposed on all 
imports.
