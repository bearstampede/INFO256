¶1. (SBU/Noforn) Post delivered reftel message to the GOC on 
August 21 as Canadian government offices re-opened briefly 
Wednesday morning for the first time since last week's power 
failure.  On August 22 the Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DFAIT) confirmed the information had been circulated for 
interagency consideration, but offices have shut again today 
and the GOC will not be able to respond until the government 
is fully operational next week. 
 
¶2.  (S) DFAIT noted that some of the designees had not, when 
considered in the past, met the "reasonable grounds" 
threshold necessary for designation in Canada, and will let 
us know if further information on any of the names would be 
helpful.  The European response is likely to weigh into the 
GOC's decision.
