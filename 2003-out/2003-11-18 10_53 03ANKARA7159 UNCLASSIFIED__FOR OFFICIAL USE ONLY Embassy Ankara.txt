(SBU) As requested reftel, Embassy contacted Muharrem 
Dortkasli, Deputy General Manger of TUSA (Turk Havacilik 
Sanayii, AS) to ask whether TUSA had placed any orders 
for J-69 Teledyne engines. Dortkasli stated that his 
company did not place any orders with Bulent Gurel or 
Sofitek for the engines. He said that in June 2002 TUSAS 
collected offers from several companies, including 
Sofitel to purchase 15 J-69s for development of T-37 
aircraft, but due to budgetary restrictions the projects 
have not been implemented.
