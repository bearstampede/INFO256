¶1. This is an action request.  See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. Ref A was Post's request for authorization to transfer one 
URC-119 High Frequency (HF) Radio Set to the Guatemalan 
Military through the Excess Defense Articles (EDA) Program. 
The transfer is part of a region-wide upgrade to provide an 
Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) capability to the HF radio 
network used by participants in the System of Cooperation 
Among the American Air Forces (SICOFAA).  The transfer will 
significantly enhance the ability of the U.S. Air Force to 
communicate and coordinate with the Guatemalan Air Force in 
the event of a large-scale natural disaster.  The radio is 
not well suited for communications within Guatemala and the 
possibility that it could be used for purposes other than 
intended is remote.  Department approved the transfer in Ref 
B, but recalled approval in Ref C pending Congressional 
notification.  Ref D informed Post that the Congressional 
notification period was complete and requested confirmation 
that Guatemala would accept the equipment. 
 
¶3. The Government of Guatemala will accept, in accordance 
with Section 516 of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA), a grant 
transfer of the URC-119 radio system.  The radio system is 
already physically located in Guatemala.  The Government of 
Guatemala understands that the equipment will be provided 
"as-is" and accepts responsibility for maintenance and repair. 
 
¶4. Post requests Department concurrence to transfer the radio 
set.
