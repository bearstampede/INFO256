¶1. (U) Local press reported on April 13 that the 
Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs issued more than 
32,000 employee labor cards and 12,000 work permits to 
companies last month.  Approximately 60% of the cards 
were new and there was also a "sizeable increase" in 
the issuance of group visas.  The majority of 
issuances were in the construction and maintenance 
industries. 
 
¶2.  (U) Tariq bin Deemas, head of the work permits 
department at the Ministry, stated that the increase 
in visas was related to the industrial growth and 
urban development of the UAE, and the expansion of the 
workforce is meant to create "massive economic 
development." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Though the UAE is currently 
conducting a well-publicized Amnesty Program to 
regulate and stabilize the labor market by forcing 
marginal and ineffective manpower to leave the 
country, this report suggests that the country is not 
yet ready to abandon its long-standing reliance on 
large numbers of cheap expatriate workers. (See refs A 
and D).  The Ministry recently announced that almost 
27% of the total labor force that came to the UAE in 
the last few years entered under false work contracts 
and that only 49% of registered businesses in the 
country were legitimate.  (See ref B).  By continuing 
to issue new labor cards and increase group visas in a 
period of economic stagnation, reform of the labor 
market is taking a backseat role to the continuing 
exploitation of the visa/sponsorship process whereby 
many Emiratis -- especially from the poorer northern 
Emirates -- derive significant financial gain.  (See 
ref C).
