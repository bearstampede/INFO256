(U) Classified by Political Counselor John Kunstadter, e.o. 
12958, reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
¶1. (C) As the Turkish MFA was closed for the prolonged Seker 
Bayram holiday, we presented reftel B demarche to MFA Middle 
East Head Kemal Tuzun December 2.  We noted that the 
Palestinians were rethinking their request to have the 
International Court of Justice adjudicate the legality of the 
Israeli fence. Tuzun said the MFA would consult internally 
and with its UN Mission before confirming a position. 
 
 
¶2.  (C) Tuzun predicted Turkey would vote in line with prior 
UN votes.  He said Turkey continues to value its unique 
position of having close ties with both Israel and the 
Palestinians.  However, in order to maintain its 
"credibility" with the Palestinians, Tuzun believed Turkey 
would not vote against the ICJ resolution if it came up, and 
would not oppose resolutions authorizing the Division of 
Palestinian Rights or the Committee on the Exercise of the 
Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. 
 
 
¶3.  (C) Tuzun viewed Israel's fence construction as 
counterproductive, making it more difficult to achieve a 
solution.  Tuzun said the barrier would degrade living 
conditions for the Palestinians, serve as a catalyst for 
radical activity, and be counterproductive for Israeli 
security.  Tuzun said that UN decisions may carry moral 
weight, but are not binding.  On the subject of the Geneva 
agreement, Tuzun said any effort to advance peace was 
welcome, but he worried this would take the focus off the 
Road Map, which he said was the most crucial and viable means 
of achieving a lasting settlement.
