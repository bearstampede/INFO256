Classified By: A/PolCouns Nathaniel Dean Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C)  On July 29 PolOff conveyed reftel to MFA South Asia 
Senior Policy Advisors Arjen Kool and Robert Claessens.  Kool 
and Claessens noted the similarity between reftel and the 
July 18 EU statement on Bhutan.  The GoNL remains concerned 
about the situation of the Bhutanese refugees, especially the 
current lack of an adequate appeals process for those 
refugees classified as having left Bhutan voluntarily.  The 
Dutch Ambassador to India communicated EU concerns to 
Bhutanese officials at a meeting earlier this month.  The 
Dutch MFA also conveyed concerns locally in the Hague to the 
Bhutanese Honorary Consul.  The GoNL does not have further 
bilateral meetings planned at this time. 
 
¶2. (C) The Dutch would like to see greater UN involvement in 
the resettlement process.  Kool reported that the Danes 
approached the RGOB recently to urge greater cooperation 
with, among others, UNHCR, UNDP, and UNICEF.  Kool said the 
RGOB response was positive, but no promises were made. 
 
¶3. (C) Note: To date, Dutch financial assistance to Bhutan 
focuses primarily on environmental projects (ref B).  While 
earlier this year the MFA considered whether or not to 
reallocate funding to refugee programs, Kool reports it 
currently has no plans to do so.  End Note.
