Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
¶1.  (S)  Ambassador April 17 covered ref points on fleeing 
Iraqi officials with Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher.   The 
Ambassador asked that Jordan not permit fleeing Iraqi 
officials entry into Jordan, and asked that the GOJ inform 
the USG if Jordan received any information about the travel 
of former Iraqi officials. 
 
¶2.  (S)  Muasher responded "we don't intend to take them in," 
and had his assistant write down the names of the five senior 
Iraqi officials mentioned in reftel.  He asked why the names 
of Saddam Hussein and Qusay Saddam Hussein did not appear on 
that list.  Did the USG know something more about their fate? 
 If so, he asked that we inform the GOJ.
