SUBJECT: VATICAN REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FULL CLONING BAN, 
WILLINGNESS TO COORDINATE ON UN CONVENTION 
 
REF: A) STATE 51552 (NOTAL) 
 
¶1.  PER DEPARTMENT'S REQUEST (REF A), DCM AND POLOFF REVIEWED 
THE U.S. APPROACH TO ACHIEVING AN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION TO 
BAN ALL FORMS OF HUMAN CLONING WITH NEW VATICAN DEPUTY 
FOREIGN MINISTER PIETRO PAROLIN.  PAROLIN, WHO WAS FULLY 
CONVERSANT WITH THE STATE OF PLAY ON THE CONVENTION, ASSURED 
US THAT THE HOLY SEE REMAINED FIRMLY COMMITTED TO WORKING 
WITH US TO ACHIEVE A GLOBAL BAN ON ALL FORMS OF HUMAN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

CLONING.  DCM EMPHASIZED THE GROWING INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT 
FOR A COMPLETE BAN, AND REITERATED THE FIRM U.S. OPPOSITION 
TO A PARTIAL BAN.  REFLECTING THE BROAD RANGE OF SUPPORT 
AMONG KEY COUNTRIES, PAROLIN EXPRESSED THE HOLY SEE'S 
WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE APPROACHING KEY UNDECIDED COUNTRIES 
TO BUILD FURTHER SUPPORT PRIOR TO THE FINAL DECISION ON A 
MANDATE FOR THE UN CLONING CONVENTION.  HE AGREED TO DO SO 
BOTH AT THE UN (VIA PERMANENT OBSERVER ARCHBISHOP MIGLIORE) 
AND IN CAPITALS. 
 
¶2.  RECOGNIZING OUR VIEW OF THE HOLY SEE AS A KEY ALLY IN 
ACHIEVING A COMPLETE BAN, DCM EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF AN 
UNBENDING HOLY SEE POSITION IN FAVOR OF A COMPLETE BAN.  WE 
POINTED OUT THAT ANY SIGNAL OF HOLY SEE FLEXIBILITY TOWARD A 
TWO-STEP APPROACH COULD OFFER WAVERING GOVERNMENTS MORAL 
COVER FOR A POSITION IN FAVOR OF THE FRENCH-GERMAN TWO-STEP 
APPROACH.  WHILE REAFFIRMING SUPPORT FOR A COMPLETE BAN, 
PAROLIN REITERATED THE POSITION,  PREVIOUSLY OUTLINED BY 
ARCHBISHOP MIGLIORE (REF B), THAT IF IT APPEARED THE PUSH FOR 
A COMPLETE BAN WAS LEADING TO NO AGREEMENT AT ALL, THE HOLY 
SEE WOULD SUPPORT A TWO-STEP PROCESS SUCH AS THE 
FRENCH-GERMAN PROPOSAL.  HE SAID THE HOLY SEE WOULD REGARD 
THIS AS "THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS." AT THE SAME TIME, HE SAID 
THE HOLY SEE WOULD INSIST ON LOCKING IN THE PRINCIPAL THAT NO 
FORM OF CLONING WAS ACCEPTABLE, AND THAT WORK ON A 
THERAPEUTIC BAN WOULD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW ACHIEVEMENT OF THE 
REPRODUCTIVE BAN.  DCM POINTED OUT THAT LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS 
IN FRANCE AND GERMANY TO BAN CLONING COULD AFFECT THE 
POSITION THESE COUNTRIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY PUT FORWARD. 
PAROLIN DEMONSTRATED CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THESE 
DEVELOPMENTS AND AGREED THAT THEY WERE ENCOURAGING.

¶3.  COMMENT:  PAROLIN'S CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATUS OF 
THE CLONING ISSUE AND HIS AFFIRMATION THAT THE HOLY SEE'S 
GOAL REMAINS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLE 
THAT HUMAN CLONING IN ANY FORM WAS UNACCEPTABLE SUGGEST THAT 
HE WILL BE A STRONG ALLY IN OUR EFFORT TO ACHIEVE AN 
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION BANNING ALL FORMS OF CLONING. 
PAROLIN APPEARED PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN OUR TALLY OF 
COUNTRIES MAKING UP THE THREE STREAMS OF THOUGHT ON A 
CONVENTION, AS WELL AS DOMESTIC LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN 
KEY COUNTRIES.  EMBASSY RECOMMENDS THE DEPARTMENT AND USUN 
KEEP THE HOLY SEE UP TO DATE ON SUPPORT FOR THE FULL BAN AND 
ON DOMESTIC POLITICAL SHIFTS IN KEY COUNTRIES SO THEY CAN 
TARGET THEIR ADVOCACY MOST EFFECTIVELY ON COUNTRIES IN LATIN 
AMERICA, AFRICA AND ASIA WHERE THE HOLY SEE CAN BEST BRING 
ITS INFLUENCE TO BEAR.
