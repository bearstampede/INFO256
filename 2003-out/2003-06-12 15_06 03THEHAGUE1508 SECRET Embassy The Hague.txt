(S) Ambassador conveyed Secretary's oral message on Hamas in 
a June 12 meeting with Dutch MFA Political Director Hugo 
Siblesz.  Siblesz said that the Netherlands has argued in 
Brussels for including Hamas on the EU's list of Foreign 
Terrorist Organizations and for freezing its assets.  Siblesz 
further stated the Netherlands has made the point that it is 
time to do this given the negative role Hamas is playing in 
the peace process.
