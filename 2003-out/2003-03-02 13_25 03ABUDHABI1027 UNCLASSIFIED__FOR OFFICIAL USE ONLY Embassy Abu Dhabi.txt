SUBJECT: UAE PASSES SAUDI ARABIA TO BECOME JAPAN'S TOP OIL 
SUPPLIER 
 
¶1. (U) According to official figures, UAE oil exports to 
Japan increased 20.6% in January 2003 from December 2002. 
The Emirates thus officially became the top oil exporter to 
Japan, shipping 1.05 million barrels per day (bpd), slightly 
larger than the 1.02 million bpd sent from Saudi Arabia. 
Almost one-quarter of Japan's oil imports now come from the 
UAE. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: The UAE actually exports more to Japan 
than these figures indicate (supplies delivered as a 
consequence of long-existing contracts are not reflected in 
official figures, particularly as they would probably 
indicate significant quota cheating by Abu Dhabi).  In any 
case, we believe the UAE sends about two-thirds of its 
exported oil to Japan, and Japan meets close to one-third of 
its imported energy needs from UAE sources.  The bilateral 
energy relationship is very close; most of Abu Dhabi's LNG 
exports also go to Japan and the Tokyo Electric Power 
Company -- TEPCO -- is an equity stakeholder in ADGAS, the 
main LNG producer.  Yet despite continued close ties in 
energy, Japanese companies have been notably unsuccessful in 
parlaying trade into project awards.  Japan sells a large 
number of vehicles and other durable goods in the UAE -- 
particularly machinery and computers -- but Japanese firms 
have been noticeably absent from large prestige projects in 
the utility and construction sectors.  A number of our 
Emirati interlocutors have remarked that while Japanese 
firms come on strong in initial project presentations, they 
do not follow-up as aggressively as their American, European 
or Korean competitors and that -- in contrast to the past -- 
Japanese companies no longer offer the sort of attractive 
financing packages for which they used to be famous.
