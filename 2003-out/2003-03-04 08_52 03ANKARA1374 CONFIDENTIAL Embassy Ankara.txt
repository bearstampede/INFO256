¶1. (C) This is an action request, para 3. 
 
 
¶2. (C) MFA Deputy Undersecretary Ali Tuygan called Ambassador 
the night of March 3 to express concern about reftel 
demonstration.  Tuygan asked if the US had made 
representation about the demonstration to the Kurdistan 
Democratic Party (KDP).  He said that Turkey had been unable 
to reach KDP leaders, and that Turkey was concerned that such 
large, anti-Turkey demonstrations had the potential to 
degenerate into mob violence against the Iraqi Turkmen 
population of Irbil.  Tuygan asked that the USG pass on to 
the KDP Turkey's concern and urge the KDP leadership to 
exercise restraint over its population. 
 
 
¶3. (C) While by all reports the March 3 demonstration was 
peaceful, we believe Washington should contact KDP leaders to 
covey the Turkish concern and seek a commitment from the KDP 
to do all in its power to prevent violence against the Iraqi 
Turkmen.  We believe the KDP should be commended for keeping 
the March 3 demonstration peaceful, but should also be 
reminded of the extreme sensitivity in Turkey at this 
critical time.
