CONTRIBUTION IN FUTURE

Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
Â¶1. (C) Canada supports renewing the mandate for the UN 
Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), where it currently 
provides 194 personnnel.  Peter Armstrong-Whitworth of 
Foreign Affairs' Peacekeeping Office indicated that Canada is 
considering reducing its contribution in the future, and that 
the GoC will be discussing this with us "at the appropriate 
time." 
 
2 (C) COMMENT: We know that the Department of National 
Defence (DND) is looking at ways to reduce some of its 
overseas commitments, particularly as it begins a large 
deployment to Afghanistan under ISAF.  Canada has been in 
discussions with Japan for some time, trying to convince the 
Japanese Self Defense Forces (JSDF) to provide a company of 
military engineers to replace a similar Canadian company in 
UNDOF.  DND hopes this effort will bear fruit as the JSDF 
becomes more comfortable working with the Canadian Forces.
