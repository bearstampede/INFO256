(SBU) We delivered reftel points to Ali Riza Oktay (Export 
Department, Foreign Trade Secretariat) and Ibrahim Yagli 
(Head of the Disarmament Department at the MFA) on July 9. 
Yagli said that he believed the GOT would support proposal 
FR007 at the upcoming Wassenaar Arrangement sessions, but 
also stressed that he did not know the official GOT position 
on this issue for certain. He promised to deliver the GOT 
position to us when he is aware of it.
