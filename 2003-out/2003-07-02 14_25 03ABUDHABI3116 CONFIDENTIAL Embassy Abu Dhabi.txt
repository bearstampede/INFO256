SUBJECT: (U) VEHICLES IN SUPPORT OF THE POLISH-LED 
MULTINATIONAL DIVISION IN IRAQ 
 
REF: (A) ABU DHABI 3075, (B) SECDEF 251715Z, (C) 
 
ZAKHEIM/WAHBA E-MAIL 
 
¶1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA FOR 
REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
¶2.  (C)  OUR ACTING CG IN DUBAI DISCUSSED THE ISSUE OF 
DUBAI'S VEHICLE DONATIONS TO THE POLISH-LED DIVISION IN 
IRAQ AND TO THE AFGHAN POLICE WITH SAYANTA BASU DURING A 
PHONE CALL ON JULY 1.  DUBAI HAS NOT OFFERED TO "DONATE" 
VEHICLES TO IRAQ, ACCORDING TO WHAT BASU TOLD OUR ACTING 
CG. 
¶3.  (C)  BASU SAID THE SUGGESTION ABOUT VEHICLES FOR IRAQ 
ORIGINALLY CAME FROM JEFFREY CULPEPPER OF DEUTSCHE BANK, 
WHICH ALONG WITH THE INVESTMENT OFFICE COMPRISE ISTITHMAR, 
A JOINT-VENTURE WHICH HANDLES INVESTMENTS FOR DUBAI 
STAKEHOLDERS.  BASU, A SENIOR INVESTMENT OFFICER WITHIN THE 
INVESTMENT OFFICE, MAINTAINS THAT CULPEPPER RAISED WITH DOD 
OFFICIALS IN MAY THE VEHICLE IDEA.  BASU ADDED THAT NEITHER 
THE INVESTMENT OFFICE NOR THE DUBAI EXECUTIVE OFFICE WERE 
WARM TO THE IDEA.  BASU SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT DEUTSCHE 
BANK HAS BEEN DOING WITH THE IDEA SINCE THE MAY MEETING 
WITH DOD OFFICIALS.  GIVEN THAT DUBAI IS NOT "OFFERING" 
VEHICLES FOR IRAQ, THERE IS NO SIMILAR OFFER OF VEHICLES 
FOR AFGHANISTAN. 
 
¶4.  (C)  COMMENT: SINCE RECEIPT OF REFTEL B AND AS 
DESCRIBED IN REF E-MAIL WE ASSUMED SOME MISUNDERSTANDING ON 
THE QUESTION OF DUBAI'S INTENTION TO DONATE VEHICLES.  IN 
OUR EXPERIENCE, DUBAI, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HUMANITARIAN 
RELIEF, DOES NOT DONATE ASSISTANCE.  IN ADDITION, BASU IS 
NOT A SENIOR AIDE TO SH. MOHAMED BIN RASHID AND CANNOT 
COMMIT OR SPEAK ON HIS BEHALF.  THE ABU DHABI FEDERAL LEVEL 
LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN THE ONLY SOURCE OF FINANCIAL AND 
MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN.  AS NOTED IN 
REFTEL A, THE UAEG HAS AGREED TO PROVIDE SOME AIRLIFT 
SUPPORT FOR THE POLISH-LED DIVISION.  END COMMENT.
