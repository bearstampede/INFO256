NOMINATING-OFFICER: Bruce A. Lohof 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Over time many of 'The Island's feisty editorials have 
brought them into conflict both with governments in 
power and opposition parties. However they have held 
their own and now has a strong foothold and a wide 
readership in the country.  'The Island' continues to 
strongly voice its concerns about the on going peace 
process and its mistrust of the LTTE and is criticized 
in some quarters for its ''racist Sinhala policy." 
Prabath has made quite an effort to place the press 
releases and other material circulated by the Mission 
in the centrist English daily he is responsible for. 
This type of exposure will enhance his skills while 
helping the Mission in meeting its strategic 
objectives.  He is involved in the editing, editorial 
writing and Feature writing of the Island.  He is also 
a recipient of Japanese Foreign Press Center Fellowship 
in 1997 and FOJO (Sweden) Fellowship in 2000.
