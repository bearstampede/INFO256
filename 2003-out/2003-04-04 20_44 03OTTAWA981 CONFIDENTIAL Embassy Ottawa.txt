Classified By: Pol M/C Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). 
 
(C) DFAIT Political Director Jim Wright told POL M/C April 4 
that Canada does not want to see unhelpful debates on Iraq 
surface in the various United Nations fora. Wright agrees 
that the Security Council is seized with the issue and 
believes it is making progress. Canada will therefore oppose 
efforts to reopen the "Situation in the Middle East" agenda 
item as a means of discussing Iraq.  Wright said that he 
would confirm this with Foreign Minister Graham and Canada's 
position will then be communicated to the General Assembly 
leadership.
