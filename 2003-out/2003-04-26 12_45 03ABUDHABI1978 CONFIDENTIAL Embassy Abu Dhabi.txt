¶1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C) In a 4/26 meeting with Econchief, UAE Red 
Crescent Authority (RCA) Secretary General San'a Al- 
Kitbi confirmed press reports that an RCA ship loaded 
with 700 tons of food and medicine and 12 ambulances 
left the UAE 4/25 for Umm Qasr.  RCA teams already 
operating in southern Iraq will distribute the aid. 
This was the second such shipment from the RCA to 
Iraq, with the first having arrived on 4/11.  Al-Kitbi 
said that the RCA is in the process of loading 
supplies for a third shipment to Umm Qasr. 
 
¶3.  (C) Although Al-Kitbi is pleased that the RCA is 
aiding the Shi'ite Muslims in southern Iraq, she noted 
that the Red Crescent must assist all needy Iraqis -- 
including the Sun'ni and the Kurds.  She reaffirmed 
the RCA's desire to airlift supplies to Baghdad, but 
added that the RCA would be prepared to send aid to 
Mosul, as well.  For supplying Baghdad, Al-Kitbi asked 
our opinion of the overland route via Kermanshah in 
Iran.  She said the Iranian Red Crescent has invited 
the RCA to fly into Kermanshah and will waive any fees 
or tariffs incurred during the transport of the cargo 
to Iraq.  Econoff later informed Al-Kitbi that the 
Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) in Kuwait said 
the overland route from Iran is feasible, and noted 
that the ICRC and the UN currently truck supplies to 
Baghdad via Kermanshah. 
 
¶4.  (C) Comment:  Al-Kitbi undertook to inform us when 
the RCA initiates a third shipment to Umm Qasr, or 
transports humanitarian supplies to Kermanshah and 
overland to Baghdad.  We will inform the HOC and 
CENTCOM of these RCA operations when we receive the 
details.  Subsequent to our meeting with Al-Kitbi, we 
were apprised that Baghdad International Airport is 
now open to humanitarian flights.  We have passed this 
welcome news, plus details on modalities for securing 
clearances, to the RCA.  We expect that we will 
shortly receive requests to facilitate flights into 
Baghdad, and will work closely with the HOC to obtain 
clearances for the RCA to deliver humanitarian 
supplies via charter or UAE military aircraft.  End 
comment.
