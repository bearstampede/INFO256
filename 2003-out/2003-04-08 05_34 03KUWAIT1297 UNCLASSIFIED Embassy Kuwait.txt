The  Polish Ambassador to Kuwait, Voycheck Bozil,  called 
the  Operations Center on April 7 at 1810 to request  USG 
assistance  in locating two Polish journalists  who  were 
apparently captured within an area approximately 100  km. 
from Al-Hilla, or Hilla, Iraq. Ambassador Bozik said  the 
journalists  rented a car from Kuwait, and  claimed  that 
they  had  received permission from the  US  military  to 
enter  Iraq.  His sources also claimed that  one  of  the 
journalists escaped from his captors on April 7  at  2:30 
p.m.  The names of the journalists are as follows:

(Described as the Polish version of CNN). He can be
