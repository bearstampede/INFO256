SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  In Kirkuk, the 30-member city council was chosen by Coalition 
authorities on 24 May.  Each of the main ethnic groups (Kurds, 
Turkmen, Assyrians, and Arabs) is represented on the council, 
which has also elected three assistant mayors: an ethnic Turk, an 
Assyrian, and a Kurd.  A mayor and deputy mayor were chosen on 
May 28.  The mayor is a Kurd, and the deputy mayor is an Arab. 
 
¶2.  ORHA reported that the USD 20 emergency payments were ready 
and would be distributed immediately following the elections. 
The security situation in northern Iraq is currently calm; 
however, the attack on a U.S. Military convoy about 100 
kilometers north of Baghdad is still an indicator that not all is 
well.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
MINISTRY OF RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  The Ministry of Reconstruction and Development (MORAD) hosted 
on 24 May its weekly coordination meeting, at which the United 
Nations Office of Project Services (UNOPS) presented the results 
of a recent survey of internally displaced persons (IDPs) living 
in public buildings.  In an exercise that ended in early May, 
UNOPS surveyed 13,359 IDP families living in 300 public buildings 
in the three northern Governorates of Dahuk, Arbil, and As 
Sulaymaniyah. 
 
¶3.  According to a 2001 U.N.-HABITAT Site and Family Survey, 
there are 805,505 IDPs living in the Kurdish-controlled region of 
Iraq.  Three quarters of these people were displaced prior to 
1990, either as a result of the former regime's "Arabization" 
program or the al Anfal campaign.  Almost half of the IDPs are 
from former Government of Iraq-controlled areas, most from the 
cities of Kirkuk and Mosul. 
 
¶4.  The full results of the survey can be found on the 
Humanitarian Information Center's website at 
agoodplacetostart.org.  Some selective results presented in the 
MORAD meeting were: 
 
--  Timetable:  61 percent of the respondents in As Sulaymaniyah 
and 52 percent of the respondents in Arbil said they would like 
to return to their place of origin within three months.  However, 
64 percent of the respondents in Dahuk did not provide a 
timeframe for return.  Apparently this is because the majority of 
IDPs in Dahuk are from areas bordering Turkey that are lesser- 
developed and still unstable because of activities by the 
Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) and the Turkish military. 
 
--  Conditions for return:  66 percent of those surveyed said the 
most important condition for return is shelter.  After shelter, 
respondents cited security (12 percent), employment (9 percent), 
and legal claims (4 percent).  Only 0.3 percent cited food as a 
condition. 
 
--  Where to go:  69 percent of the respondents want to return to 
their place of origin.  19 percent want to be resettled where 
they currently live, and 12 percent want to go to a third 
location. 
 
-------------------- 
FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 
-------------------- 
¶5.  A DART food officer traveled to Kirkuk on 26 May and met with 
WFP and Ministry of Trade (MOT) staff.  Following insecurity in 
Kirkuk and recent looting of MOT stocks, newly arrived Coalition 
forces are now guarding WFP's warehouse and its perimeter.  WFP 
believes this will deter potential looters.  According to MOT 
silo staff in Kirkuk, Coalition forces also have agreed to secure 
other MOT complexes, although this has not yet happened. 
 
¶6.  As previously reported, beginning 27 May, WFP Mosul and 
Kirkuk will begin receiving up to 115,000 metric tons (MT) of 
bulk wheat grain over the next two weeks.  WFP will store the 
grain at MOT silos in the two Governorates.  An initial shipment 
of 30,000 MT will go to Mosul.  The DART will monitor the 
shipments. 
 
¶7.  WFP recently signed an agreement with the MOT to store 50,000 
MT of wheat in open bins at its Kirkuk silo.  There is currently 
60,000 MT of last year's wheat harvest in other bins there and, 
reportedly, a total of 140,000 MT in the Governorate's four 
silos.  The wheat currently stored in Kirkuk appears to be in 
good condition.  MOT staff were awaiting instructions from 
Baghdad on how milling will be done; previously the mix had been 
25 percent local wheat and 75 percent Oil for Food imported 
wheat. 
 
¶8.  The MOT silo manager stated that he needs 35 million Iraqi 
Dinar (ID) a month to pay staff salaries at all four silos (based 
on pre-war rates).  On 25 May, he used seven million ID from the 
MOT Kirkuk silo bank account (the balance was 16 million ID) to 
pay a 20 percent salary to all silo employees.  The manager noted 
that neither the USD 20 emergency payment nor a formal salary 
from the Coalition Provisional Administration had yet been made 
to his staff.
