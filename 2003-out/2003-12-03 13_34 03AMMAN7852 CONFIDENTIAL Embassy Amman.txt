E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/03/2013 
TAGS: PREL KPAL IS JO UNGA
SUBJECT: UN ACTION ON THE MIDDLE EAST:  JORDAN LIKELY TO 
SUPPORT PALESTINIAN RESOLUTION ON WALL/ICJ, IF PRESENTED 
 
REF: STATE 329381 
 
Classified By: CDA David M. Hale for reasons 1.5 (b) (d) 
 
¶1.  (C)  In the absence of Foreign Minister Muasher and 
Office Director Al-Ayed (both traveling), PolCouns December 3 
delivered to Basheer Zoubi, Acting Director of the Foreign 
Minister's Private Office, ref points on the possible UNGA 
Special Session on the Middle East and a possible Palestinian 
draft resolution declaring Israeli non-compliance with UNGA 
resolutions and asking the ICJ for an advisory opinion on the 
Israeli separation barrier.  PolCouns made clear that the 
U.S. strongly opposes any resolution that introduces the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict into the ICJ.  He requested that 
Jordan work to convince the Palestinians that introduction of 
such a resolution would be counterproductive and, if such a 
resolution is introduced, asked that Jordan vote against or 
abstain on it. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Zoubi said that he understood the U.S. position and 
would convey it to FonMin Muasher.  However, he said, absent 
any concrete evidence that introduction of the wall issue at 
the ICJ would delay dismantling of the wall or implementation 
of the Quartet roadmap, Jordan was likely to vote with the 
Arab group for such a resolution.  In any case, Zoubi 
commented, he understood from the Jordanian Mission in New 
York that any special session was likely to be delayed until 
December 8 or 9.
