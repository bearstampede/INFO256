 (d). 
 
Summary 
======== 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On September 15, the Maoists killed two policeman 
and seriously injured three others in three separate 
incidents across the Kingdom.  The Maoists are reportedly 
impressing families to provide a daughter or son aged 13-22 
under the threat of "dire consequences."  End summary. 
 
Maoist "Hits" on Police 
======================== 
 
¶2.  (U)  On September 15, the press reports that Maoists 
killed two policemen and seriously injured three in separate 
incidents in Nepalgunj (mid-west), Pokhara (198 kms west of 
Kathmandu), and Dang (mid-west).  In Pokhara, Maoist 
attackers approached on a motorcycle, firing at police 
guarding a Deputy Inspector General's office, killing one and 
seriously injuring a second. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Unconfirmed police reports link these killings with 
a new directive by the Maoist leadership.  The police believe 
that Maoist cadre have been directed to kill on-sight any 
security forces in Nepalgunj, Pokhara, and Kathmandu.  The 
order was to be enacted in Kathmandu Valley starting at 2:00 
pm.  As of 6:00 pm, the Embassy had received no reports of 
attacks on police forces in the valley. 
 
Maoist Recruitment of Children 
=============================== 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Over the last five days, the Maoists have issued 
letters and verbal demands to households in rural areas 
stating that each household must provide either one son or 
daughter to serve in the Maoists' "People's Liberation Army." 
 The Maoists will accept children as young as 13 and as old 
as 22.  Families that do not contribute as demanded will face 
"dire consequences."  Separate reports indicate that these 
notes have been distributed as far afield as Gorkha (in 
Nepal's west) to Sindhuli (in Nepal's southeast).  (Note:  In 
two weeks, Nepalese will celebrate the festival week of 
Dashain.  It is traditional to return to home villages to 
visit family, pay respect to family elders, and, if well-off, 
provide some funds for upkeep of the family farm.  The 
impressment of children to serve with the Maoists will deter 
many from returning home.  End note.) 
 
¶5.  (SBU) On September 15, unconfirmed police sources 
reported to the Embassy that the Maoists are attempting to 
recruit street children.  The Maoists are reportedly offering 
USD 675 for the killing of anyone listed on the Maoists' hit 
list. 
 
Comment 
======== 
 
¶6.  (C) The police reports of hits on security personnel and 
recruitment of street children attribute an evolving urban 
strategy to the Maoists.  The reports, while repeated above 
for completeness, are unconfirmed.  Maoist demands for the 
recruitment of children has been confirmed by multiple 
sources and has been a Maoist practice for years.  The formal 
notes demanding children is a more formal approach than 
previously reported.
