SUBJECT: CANADA NOT INTERESTED IN CONSENSUS SLATE FOR 
UNESCO BOARD 
 
REF: STATE 93655 
 
(U) We delivered reftel talking points on April 11 to Ross 
Snyder, Deputy Director for U.N. Specialized Agencies in 
DFAIT's International Organizations Bureau, on April 11. In a 
follow-up discussion April 17, Snyder told poloff that, in 
Canada's view, it will be very difficult at this point for 
the Group 1 countries to come up with a consensus slate of 
candidates for the Board, as countries which have announced 
their candidacies are unlikely to step aside. Snyder said 
that Canada intends to pursue its own Board candidacy and is 
not interested in pursuing a consensus slate, unless a 
formalized rotation of board membership can be worked out 
among the Group 1 countries.
