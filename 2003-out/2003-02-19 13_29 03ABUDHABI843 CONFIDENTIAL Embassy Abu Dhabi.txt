SUBJECT: UAEG ASSURES ARAB LEAGUE MINISTERIAL 
STATEMENT NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF MAJORITY VIEW 
 
REF: CAIRO 1297 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for 
reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (C) During a 19 February meeting with the Ambassador, 
MFA Asst U/S Abdullah Rashid Al-Nuaimi provided a candid 
readout on the Arab League Extraordinary Ministerial held 
in Cairo 15-16 February.  Noting that he attended because 
he thought it would be a "good show", Al-Nuaimi commented 
that there was much disagreement at the Ministerial, which 
ended in frustration for most attendees. 
 
3.(C) Al-Nuaimi stated that it became quickly apparent 
there was no consensus on Iraq and the Ministers did not 
intend to issue a statement at the conclusion of the 
Ministerial.  In the end it was pushed through by some, 
namely Syria with Lebanon for cover in the President's 
chair.  The UAEG official commented that attendees allowed 
the statement's issuance, even though it did not reflect 
the opinion of the majority, because given the deep 
divisions "it's just a paper and doesn't mean much."  Al- 
Nuaimi continued that "We all want a unified Arab position, 
but one that is realistic and not just rhetoric to be 
written in the newspapers.  Now is not the time for such 
rhetoric!"  Al-Nuaimi added that he doubted very much a 
Summit would be held at the end of the month.  "There was 
total disagreement at the Ministerial level, why embarrass 
the Heads of State?"
