¶3.  (U)  TEXT OF DIPLOMATIC NOTE: 
 
THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
 
Ref. No.:  MEEM KAF/2/14/1834 
Date:  November 10, 2003 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Hashemite Kingdom of 
Jordan presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United 
States of America in Amman.  Following to its note No. MEEM 
KAF/2/14/1302 dated August 28, 2003, the Ministry has the 
honor to attach to the Embassy a list of thirty-seven 
Jordanians who are still detained in Iraq.  The American 
forces do not permit them to depart though not a single 
accusation was presented against them, and the reasons for 
preventing them from departure to the Hashemite Kingdom of 
Jordan were not clarified.  They should be treated like 
others from different nationalities who were in the same 
situation and were permitted to leave. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Hashemite Kingdom of 
Jordan will be very thankful if the Embassy provides it with 
any information about the names in the list and the names of 
any other (Jordanians) detained by coalition forces in Iraq 
and the reasons behind their detention. 
 
The Ministry takes this opportunity to renew to the Embassy 
its highest consideration.
