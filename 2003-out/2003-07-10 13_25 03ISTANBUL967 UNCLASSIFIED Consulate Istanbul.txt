¶1.  On this day, the staff of AmConGen Istanbul is moving to 
its newly finished and dedicated office building in Istinye 
some 11 miles northeast of the historic "Palazzo Corpi," 
which has served as the centerpiece of a U.S. Legation, U.S. 
Embassy, and U.S. Consulate since its own completion in 
¶1882.  We leave these premises with renewed respect for all 
those who have served here before us and with deep gratitude 
for the aging but beautiful "grande dame" who hosted us with 
such care and affection as the metropolis of Istanbul grew 
up around her and a new, more threatening world pressed in 
upon her.  This will be our last transmission from 
Beyoglu/Pera and the Palazzo Corpi.  We will be back on line 
from Istinye on Tuesday, July 15.

Kaplicalar Mevkii Sokak No. 2 
Istinye-Sariyer, Istanbul, Turkey 
post code 34460
