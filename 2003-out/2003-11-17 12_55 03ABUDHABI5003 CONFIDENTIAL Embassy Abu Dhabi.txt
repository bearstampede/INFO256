(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, 
for Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶1. (C) Two senior leaders in the UAEG told the 
Ambassador on November 16 that they applaud the 
U.S. decision to accelerate the transfer of 
authority to the Iraqis.  Deputy Prime Minister 
and de facto Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamdan bin 
Zayed Al-Nahyan (HbZ) said the decision was a 
very wise move that should reduce the current 
volatile situation in Iraq.  As HbZ did in his 
meetings with senior Administration officials in 
Washington in late October (refs C, D), he said 
Iraqis will need a stable Iraqi leadership that 
the Governing Council has been unable to 
provide.  Post provided the UAEG with a copy of 
the GC-CPA agreement contained in ref B. 
 
¶2. (C) In a meeting with the Ambassador in 
Dubai, Dubai Crown Prince and UAE Minister of 
Defense Shaykh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum 
(MbR) called the decision a very important move, 
adding that the Iraq problem must be fixed 
before the U.S. election season.  MbR said the 
selection of the Transitional National Assembly 
will be key to the success of the ensuing steps 
of establishing an interim government, the 
drafting of a new Iraqi constitution, and 
electing a new Iraqi government.  MbR told the 
Ambassador that if a majority of Iraqis do not 
see the Transitional National Assembly as a 
credible entity, it will de-legitimize the 
entire process as well as the American role. 
MbR cautioned that the Shi'a majority will not 
find it easy to separate State from religion 
since for the Shi'a such a separation is 
artificial.  He said it is therefore very 
important that the interim government consist of 
credible Iraqis, from all sects and ethnic 
groups, who are effective leaders with strong 
roots in the tribal and family clans throughout 
Iraq.
