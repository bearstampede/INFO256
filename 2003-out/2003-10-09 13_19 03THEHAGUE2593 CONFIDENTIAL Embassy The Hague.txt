REF: THE HAGUE 1421 
 
Classified By: DCM Daniel R. Russel.  Reasons 1.5(b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: Several Dutch organizations have been 
identified as assuming the tasks carried out by Al Aqsa 
Foundation (NL) in providing support for Hamas.  Dutch 
authorities are investigating and trying to build a case for 
legal action or further asset freeze orders.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) The Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported on September 
30 that several Dutch non-profits (further details below) 
have taken over the activities previously carried out by Al 
Aqsa Foundation (Netherlands) in supporting Hamas-related 
"social" activities.  One of these organizations -- The 
Jerusalem Foundation (established 7/03) -- is headquartered 
at the same address as Al Aqsa Foundation Netherlands and 
indicates providing support for the families of suicide 
bombers as one of its activities.   The Secretary of the 
Jerusalem Foundation is Martine van den Ooever, a Dutch 
convert to Islam who studied in Islamic schools in Syria and 
dresses in traditional Moslem style. The two other officers 
of the Jerusalem Foundation -- Ali Atilla Sonlu and Rashad 
Abdil-Rahman Al-Baz -- were also officers of the Al Aqsa 
Foundation (Netherlands). 
 
¶3. (C) Dutch authorities have told us that they have been 
investigating the Jerusalem Foundation with the aim of 
building a case against it for providing support for Hamas 
and/or freezing its assets/financial transactions on the 
grounds that it is an alias for 
Al Aqsa Foundation.  They believe they do not currently have 
enough evidence to ensure a victory in a domestic court case. 
 The investigation continues. 
 
¶4. (U) Also mentioned by De Telegraaf as having taken over 
many of Al Aqsa Foundation's activities is the Al Maktabah 
Foundation (details reftel) (located at the former address of 
the Al Aqsa Foundation bookshop), the Kifaia Foundation, and 
the Israa Foundation (details reftel).  Israa Foundation 
Treasurer Maurice Raymondo van Ettinger is said to be the 
person who influenced van den Ooever to convert to Islam.
