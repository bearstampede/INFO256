(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch for reasons 1.5 (B) and 
(D). 
 
 
¶1. (C) MFA's International Political Organizations Department 
Head Feza Ozturk reiterated GOT's acceptance of our offer to 
provide access to smallpox and anthrax vaccines at meetings 
on 2/17 with EconCouns and 2/18 with EconOff, Post Medical 
Officer and the Team Leader of the Department's Smallpox 
Vaccination Program.  The GOT request (Ref A) is to receive 
vaccines for 30,000 persons (30,000 doses) for smallpox and 
for 70,000 persons (420,000 doses) for anthrax. Once we 
advise that the vaccines have been allocated to Turkey, MFA 
will arrange for our expert team to meet with the Ministry of 
Health and Turkish General Staff regarding training, vaccine 
handling and other logistics. 
 
 
¶2. (C) ACTION AND COMMENT.  Demarche instructions (Ref B) 
refer to U.S. willingness to provide access to vaccines and 
to the offer as foreign assistance.  They do not mention 
costs or payments.  The Turks understood this to mean "no 
cost."  We offered the vaccines to the Turks and they 
accepted our offer.  Embassy requests confirmation that 
vaccines are to be delivered at no-cost to GOT.  Embassy also 
requests confirmation as soon as possible that we can meet 
GOT request for specified quantities and receive information 
on how these vaccines will be made available.
