SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED TO DUTCH ON GEORGIAN ELECTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 242687 
 
Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION DANIEL RUSSEL FOR 
REASONS 1.5 (B AND D) 
 
¶1. (C) DCM AND POLOFF MADE REFTEL POINTS TO DUTCH MFA OSCE 
TASK FORCE CHIEF AMB. DAAN EVERTS AND TASK FORCE STAFF IN 
SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS ON AUGUST 22.  AMB. EVERTS TOLD DCM 
THAT DESPITE BEING "VERY DISAPPOINTED" WITH THE STATE OF 
AFFAIRS IN GEORGIA, THE OSCE WOULD ENGAGE IN THE SELECTION OF 
THE CHAIR OF THE CENTRAL ELECTION COMMISSION (CEC). 
 
¶2. (C) OSCE TASK FORCE STAFF OFFICERS ALEX OOSTERWIJK AND 
FRANK VAN BEUNINGEN REPEATED TO POLOFF DUTCH CONCERNS 
(REFTEL) THAT GIVEN THAT THE GEORGIAN PARLIAMENT HAD NOT 
APPROVED ARTICLE 18 OF THEIR UNIFORM ELECTION CODE (UEC), THE 
NEW CEC WOULD BE TAINTED, AND THE OSCE MIGHT BE SEEN AS 
"RUBBER-STAMPING" A FLAWED PROCESS.  THEY ALSO RAISED 
CONCERNS ABOUT REPORTS OF ALLEGED COLLUSION BETWEEN 
OPPOSITION PARTIES REVIVAL AND THE INDUSTRIALISTS AND THE 
GOVERNMENT WHICH WOULD DILUTE THE POTENTIAL INDEPENDENCE OF 
THE CEC.  NEVERTHELESS THEY SAID THE OSCE WOULD BE HEAVILY 
INVOLVED IN OBSERVING AND MONITORING THE ELECTIONS. 
OOSTERWIJK AND VAN BEUNINGEN MADE SOME PROCEDURAL 
DISTINCTIONS AS WELL.  THEY SAID THAT THE BAKER PLAN DID NOT 
STIPULATE THAT THE OSCE APPOINT THE CEC CHAIRMAN BUT RATHER 
THE OSCE WOULD ADVISE PRESIDENT SHEVARDNADZE AS TO WHOM HE 
SHOULD APPOINT.  TO THIS END, THE DUTCH HAVE IDENTIFIED 
ROMANIAN HEAD OF DELEGATION TO THE OSCE (AND FORMER UN 
SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE TO ABKHAZIA) LIVIO BOTA AND BULGARIAN 
PLAMEN NICOLOV, COUNCIL OF EUROPE SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR 
GEORGIA, TO SERVE ON AN AD HOC ADVISORY BODY TO ASSIST IN 
APPOINTING A CEC CHAIR.  THEY ALSO SAID THAT THE OSCE DOES 
NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO APPOINT ALL 75 REGIONAL ELECTORAL 
COMMITTEE CHAIRS.
