SUBJECT: TURKISH CABINENT APPROVES USE OF BASES AND PORTS 
FOR OPERATIONS CONSISTENT WITH UNSCR 1483; EUCOM REQUEST TO 
STATION TANKERS AT INCIRLIK ALSO APPROVED 
 
(U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. 
Reasons:  1.5 (B and D). 
 
 
¶1. (C) MFA DDG for the Americas Suna Ilicak told the DCM June 
25 that the Turkish cabinet earlier this week had approved 
the use of Turkish bases and ports for humanitarian and 
reconstruction operations covered under UNSCR 1483.  Ilicak 
said the Cabinet's decision came in the form of a decree, is 
now in effect, and does not require Parliamentary approval or 
an MOU.  The decree applied to all allies and friendly 
nations.  In terms of procedures, Ilicak said if the US 
wanted to use a specific base or port, the Embassy should 
follow "normal" procedures and submit a diplomatic note to 
the MFA, who would then coordinate a response with the 
Turkish General Staff (TGS).  Pol-Mil officer sought 
clarification, noting that the US previously had conveyed 
requests for the use of Turkish bases/ports through military 
channels (i.e. a letter from the Office of Defense 
Cooperation to TGS), with the Embassy back-briefing the MFA. 
He reminded Ilicak that EUCOM's recent request to station 10 
tankers and one ISR aircraft at Incirlik to support OEF and 
OIF missions was conveyed through military channels.  Ilicak 
said the MFA would confer with the TGS and get back to us on 
whether the US should convey future requests via civilian 
(i.e. the MFA) or military (i.e. TGS) channels. 
 
 
¶2. (C) The DCM asked if the Cabinet's decision covered 
EUCOM's request.  Ilicak said that in her view the answer was 
"yes."  However, TGS would have to make the final decision. 
Citing another hypothetical example, the DCM asked if the 
Cabinet's decree would apply to a request for US aircraft 
transporting goods and supplies to OCPA to stop at Incirlik 
and then proceed to Iraq.  Ilicak said she believed the 
decree covered such an example. 
 
 
¶3. (C) Later the same day, a TGS/J3 officer telephoned ODC to 
inform that, consistent with the Cabinet's decree, TGS had 
verbally approved EUCOM's request.  The TGS officer said the 
formal approval in writing would be forthcoming.  ODC intends 
to follow up with TGS in person June 26 to obtain more 
details.
