SUBJECT: TFIZ01: JORDAN WILL PROTECT IRAQI DIPLOMATIC 
PROPERTY 
 
REF: SECSTATE 93783 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
Â¶1.  (S)  PolCouns on April 13 delivered ref points on the 
protection of Iraqi diplomatic property to Ali al-Ayed, 
personal assistant to Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher. 
Al-Ayed said Jordan had already taken steps to protect the 
Iraqi Embassy in Jordan even though no threat had yet arisen. 
 GOJ officials, al-Ayed said, have also stated publicly that 
Jordan would protect Iraqi facilities in Jordan.  He noted 
that, aside from the three Iraqi Intelligence Service 
officers expelled from Jordan several weeks ago, all of the 
Iraqi diplomats accredited to Jordan, including the 
Ambassador, remain in Amman and continue to occupy the Iraqi 
embassy compound.
