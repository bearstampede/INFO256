REF: ABU DHABI 1471 AND PREVIOUS   B) STATE 79964 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for reasons 
1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
---------------- 
General Overview 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) COM convened Abu Dhabi's Iraq Task Force/core 
Emergency Action Committee (EAC) at 1000 local time, 3/29. 
Embassy Abu Dhabi, FCS (located outside of the Embassy 
compound), and the USGS office in Al Ain are open 3/29 with 
full staffing. 
 
-------- 
SECURITY 
-------- 
 
¶3.  (S/NF) ORCA reported no new developments on the threat 
posed by the Iraqi Intelligence Services (IIS) outlined in 
ref B.  A four-person Iraqi cell is believed to be in 
country but the members, who might have entered the country 
under aliases, have not been located. 
 
¶4.  (S/NF) UAE security forces have worked closely with the 
Embassy to respond to the threats. RSO met with the Abu 
Dhabi police chief on 3/29. The police have agreed to 
increase visible uniformed security at several Mission 
residences as well as increase patrols in the locations of 
other Embassy residences.  The police have also agreed to 
increase uniformed officers at the American School and the 
new Embassy compound. 
 
¶5.  (S/NF) FBI reported a vague, new threat in the UAE 
originating from Somalia and targeting official Americans 
and businesses.  The credibility of the threat is currently 
unclear. 
 
¶6.  (S/NF) USLO confirmed that U.S. military forces in the 
UAE are on Force Protection Condition Delta in response to 
the IIS security threat.  Al-Dhafra airbase reported what 
are believed to be false positives for bubonic plague on 
3/28. The base was alerted to the possible airborne threat 
by the Portal Shield Device which has been installed for 
some time. Definitive confirmation is pending the testing 
of samples sent to Bahrain.  The UAEG has not been told of 
the incident. 
 
¶7.  (C) RSO noted there was a large, peaceful demonstration 
in Dubai on 3/28, but that so far, there have been no 
demonstrations in Abu Dhabi. 
 
----------------------- 
UAEG Actions/Statements 
----------------------- 
 
¶8.   (C) The UAEG will be shipping 2000 tons of food to 
Iraq in the next few days. ECON will meet with the Red 
Crescent Society on 3/29 to offer assistance in 
coordinating humanitarian relief programs. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Consular/American Citizen Services 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  (U) The Consular Section received a few phone calls 
from wardens asking about the Dubai demonstrations. 
 
----------- 
Local Media 
----------- 
 
¶10.  (U) PAO reported that Abu Dhabi-controlled media (ADTV 
and Al Ittihad newspaper) are trying to keep a lid on 
public opinion by offering more balanced and moderate 
coverage of the war.  Privately owned newspapers continue 
to carry strident reporting and are selling more copies 
than Al Ittihad.  Al Khaleej newspaper often uses the word 
"massacre" in major headlines describing Iraqi civilian 
casualties. 
 
¶11.  (U) The Abu Dhabi-based Zayed Center for Coordination 
and Follow-up, affiliated with the Arab League, published a 
study reporting that the quest for oil and global 
domination are the motivations behind this war. 
 
¶12.  (U) On Wednesday, 4/2, the Northern Emirate of Sharjah 
will hold a festival to be attended by the Sharjah ruler's 
wife in support of the Iraqi people. 
¶13.  (U) Abu Dhabi Iraq Task Force/EAC will reconvene at 
1000 local time, 3/30. 
 
¶14.  (U) Iraq Task Force/EAC members in attendance included 
AMB, DCM, RSO, DAO, P/M, POL, ECON, CONS, MSG, OBO, PAO, 
ADMIN, USLO, FCS, FBI.
