SUBJECT: AFTER THE BOMBING, JORDAN REQUESTS U.S. PROTECTION 
FOR ITS RELOCATED MISSION IN BAGHDAD

GOJ REQUESTS USG SECURITY FOR NEW BAGHDAD MISSION 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶1.  (S)  Ali al-Ayed, Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher's 
Private Office Director, told PolCouns August 10 that, 
despite the August 7 bombing of the Jordanian Embassy 
building in Baghdad (ref), Jordan wishes to maintain a 
diplomatic and security presence in Baghdad.   Al-Ayed said 
Jordan hopes to move its operations from the ruined chancery 
into the current Ambassador's residence.  In light of the 
"obviously high risk" to Jordanian personnel in Baghdad, 
al-Ayed said the GOJ is formally requesting USG security 
protection for the relocated Jordanian mission. 
 
¶2.  (S)  Al-Ayed said that the USG's agreement (or refusal) 
to provide "sufficient and complete security" for the 
relocated chancery in Baghdad would weigh heavily in Jordan's 
decision to maintain its presence, and the level of activity 
and visibility of that presence.  Al-Ayed said the GOJ has 
indications the Jordanian presence in Iraq is already being 
targeted for a second attack.  "We can't let this happen 
again.  We don't want to pack it in and let the terrorists 
win."

SECURITY AT THE ALTERNATE CHANCERY SITE 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C)  Al-Ayed said the old Jordanian Ambassador's 
residence is located in a quiet part of the al-Mansour 
neighborhood of Baghdad, and that several other diplomatic 
properties are located on the same block:  the Moroccan 
Embassy, the Libyan Embassy, and the Libyan Ambassador's 
residence.  The residence is a large house that has a 25 
meter setback from the street in front.  He said that the GOJ 
would take some measures to increase physical security at the 
site, e.g. by installing jersey barriers.  However, he asked 
for USG assistance in providing "a more visible deterrent" to 
new attacks, such as drop bars on the street or permanent 
static U.S. military positions in the neighborhood.  "After 
the bombing, we are a special case, and we need (the USG's) 
help."

ONE JORDANIAN DIES IN BOMBING 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C)  Al-Ayed mentioned that the GOJ has determined that 
one of those killed in the August 7 blast was a Jordanian 
citizen resident in Iraq.  The Jordanian, he said, had 
apparently been standing in line for consular services 
outside the Embassy at the time of the bombing.  No Jordanian 
government employees had been killed, although some had been 
injured, including one security officer whose leg had been 
crushed in the explosion.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5.  (C)  Given the helpful role Jordan wishes to play in 
rebuilding Iraq, we should do what we can on the security 
front to encourage an active Jordanian presence in Baghdad. 
 
¶6.  (U)  CPA Baghdad minimize considered.
