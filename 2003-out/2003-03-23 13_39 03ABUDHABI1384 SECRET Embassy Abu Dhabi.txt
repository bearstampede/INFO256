SUBJECT: (S) JORDANIAN OIL NEEDS: UAE READY TO 
TRANSFER FUNDS 
 
¶1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA 
FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶2.  (S)  IN THE COURSE OF A MEETING ON THE 
AFTERNOON OF 3/23, MFA MINSTATE SHAYKH HAMDAN BIN 
ZAYID STATED THAT HE HAD BEEN CALLED BY JORDANIAN 
FM MUASHER THE PREVIOUS EVENING, WHO HAD TOLD HIM 
THAT IRAQ HAD CUT ITS OIL PIPELINE SUPPLY TO 
JORDAN EARLIER THAT DAY.  SHAYKH HAMDAN SAID SAUDI 
ARABIA AND KUWAIT WILL SUPPLY JORDAN WITH 75 
THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY (KSA 50,000 AND KUWAIT 
25,000).  THE UAE IS PROVIDING JORDAN WITH AN 
IMMEDIATE CASH INFUSION TO HELP DEFRAY THE COST OF 
PURCHASING FUEL FROM OTHER SOURCES.  THE MONEY IS 
READY NOW AND WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE JORDANIAN 
CENTRAL BANK AS SOON AS AMMAN PROVIDES THE 
APPROPRIATE ACCOUNT NUMBER.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED 
IF THE EMIRATI CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO 
COVER WHAT WE UNDERSTOOD HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY 
AGREED -- 25,000 BARRELS PER DAY (BPD).  SHAYKH 
HAMDAN STATED THE UAE WOULD DO ITS BEST TO PROVIDE 
THE CASH EQUIVALENT OF 25 THOUSAND BPD.
