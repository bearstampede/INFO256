Â¶1. Article in Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La Tribuna" on 
6/30 entitled "Honduras on course to become a Narco State". "U.S. 
Ambassador Larry Palmer stated that even though Honduras is not 
considered a `Narco State', it may be on course to become one." 
 
"Palmer affirmed, `that is why it is essential to take needed 
action as early as possible to avoid this through the legal 
institutions and through the police'." 
 
"When asked about the role of the General Attorney's Office, 
Palmer declared, `I don't think it has done a good job because 
during the nine months I've been in Honduras, I haven't seen it 
accuse or prosecute any of the prominent individuals who are 
suspected of being involved in criminal activities'."
