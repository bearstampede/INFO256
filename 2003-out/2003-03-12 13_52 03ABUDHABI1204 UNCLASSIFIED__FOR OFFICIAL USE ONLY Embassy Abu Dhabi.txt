Â¶1. (U) Local press prominently reported the resolution of a 
strike by forty laborers against a contracting firm on March 11. 
The employees stopped working for a week to protest the decision 
of the firm to pay them daily instead of monthly (why daily 
payments were perceived as pernicious by the workers is not 
clear).  Though the original work contract mandated daily 
payments, the employer had been paying wages on a monthly basis 
for the previous six months. The Labour Disputes Section of the 
Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs dispatched a team to 
investigate the complaint and mediated an agreement between the 
parties, convincing the workers to end their protest.  The 
Ministry sided with the workers and concluded that since they had 
been paid monthly for the last six months, the original contract 
was superceded. The contractor agreed to abide by the Ministry's 
decision. 
 
2.(SBU) Comment:  As this example demonstrates, workers in the 
UAE enjoy some degree of latitude when it comes to exercising 
their rights.  The environment fostered by the government is 
generally permissive, explaining why the occasional work 
stoppage/strike, while technically unsanctioned in law, is 
nonetheless viewed benignly by the authorities.  Although these 
informal rights are not inconsiderable, the UAE federal 
government--in an effort to further modernize the economy -- is 
nonetheless pushing forward with formal legislation to 
institutionalize unions and clearly define their role (see 
reftels).
