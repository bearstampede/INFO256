¶1.  Action recommendation at paragraph 4. 
 
¶2.  (U) The Coalition Provisional Authority of Iraq (CPA) 
announced July 21 that a bidders' conference for companies 
with an interest in a recently-issued mobile telecom services 
tender in Iraq would be held in Amman July 31.  The tender, 
which will be published July 28, will offer licenses to 
operate mobile telecom networks in Iraq.  Up to three 
licenses are expected to be made available. 
 
¶3.  (U) Featured speakers at the one-day conference, to be 
held at the Amman Grand Hyatt, include: Jordanian Minister of 
Information Communications and Technology Fawaz Zu'bi; Dr. 
Shakir Abdullah, Secretary General of the Iraqi Ministry of 
Transport and Communications (MOTC); Abdul Latif, Director 
General of the Iraq Telegraph and Posts Company; Jim Davies, 
Senior CPA Communications Advisor to the MOTC; and David 
Leech, MOTC Communications Director.  In addition to the 
bidding process, the conference will cover the future of 
mobile network telephone services, data networks, and 
Internet services in Iraq.  Attendees will have the 
opportunity to speak directly with CPA and MOTC telecom 
officials. 
 
¶4.  (U) RECOMMENDATION: Due to the short notice of the 
conference announcement and limited tender process, 
organizers request that regional posts advise local telecom 
sector leads of the conference and tender offer promptly. 
Online registration and additional conference and tender
