IRAQ

Classified By: PolCouns David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) In the absence from Guatemala of Foreign Minister 
Gutierrez, the Ambassador spoke with senior Presidential 
Advisor Arturo Montenegro on March 18 to express USG concern 
over the possible convocation of a special UNGA or a special 
session of the UNCHR to condemn possible coalition military 
action against Iraq.  The Ambassador asked that Guatemala 
oppose any proposal to convoke an emergency session of the 
General Assembly, drawing on talking points in reftel. 
Montenegro responded that Guatemala has been following 
developments on the Iraqi situation, and promised to relay 
our request immediately to President Portillo. 
 
¶2. (C) Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Perez called the 
Ambassador to say that the President had directed the Foreign 
Ministry to support the USG.  Advised by the Department that 
there was a specific NAM meeting at 1500 hours, DCM McFarland 
followed up by speaking again with Deputy Foreign Minister 
Perez (who is also a close friend and advisor of President 
Portillo) and repeating our concerns.  Perez said Guatemala 
would attend a March 18, 1500 hours NAM meeting in New York, 
and would oppose the holding of an emergency UNGA on Iraq. 
Perez promised to inform Foreign Minister Gutierrez (who is 
traveling to Geneva to participate in the first week of the 
UNCHR) as well as President Portillo. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment/Action Request:  Given the absence from New 
York of Ambassador Rosenthal, we recommend that the 
Department confirm these instructions with the Guatemalan UN 
Delegation.
