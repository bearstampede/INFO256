Ghani Letter 
------------- 
¶1.     (SBU) Dutch Minister of Finance Gerrit Zalm has 
received the letter from Afghan Finance Minister Ghani (ref 
A) that concerns an appeal for accelerated pledges, according 
to MFA Afghan Desk Officer Marit van Zomeren of the MFA in a 
November 17 conversation with Embassy EconOff.  Ms. Van 
Zomeren did not have details on what the Dutch response will 
be but says the Dutch are in the process of answering the 
letter.  The latest info from the MFA about Dutch pledges is 
that they expect to disburse their 2004 pledge of EUR 17.5

Discussions With the EU 
----------------------- 
¶2.     (SBU) In other news, EU Special Rep for Afghanistan 
Vendrell was in the Hague the week of November 10.  (Note: 
German Special Rep Schmunck canceled his planned visit (ref 
B).  End Note.)  Vendrell met with Dutch FM de Hoop Scheffer, 
DG for Political Affairs Hugo Siblesz, and Deputy DG for 
Development Cooperation Rob de Vos.  According to Van 
Zomeren, Vendrell asked the Minister for the Netherlands to 
set up or contribute to a PRT, but the GONL maintains that it 
does not foresee a stand-alone Dutch PRT in the future. 
Vendrell and the Dutch also discussed the constitution and 
the upcoming elections.  Dutch officials found themselves 
agreeing with Vendrell on the need for improved coordination 
on Afghanistan: a) among EU member states; b) between the 
U.S. and the EU; and c) between NATO and the EU.  Vendrell 
told the Dutch he wants to be present at more U.S.-Brahimi-UK 
strategy meetings.  Separately, Dutch Special Afghanistan Rep 
Ronald Mollinger has expressed his desire for more contact 
and coordination with the U.S.
