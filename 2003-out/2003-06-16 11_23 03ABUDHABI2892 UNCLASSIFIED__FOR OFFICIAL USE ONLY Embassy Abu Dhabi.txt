     ¶1.  (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche June 16 to 
     UAE Authority for Standardization & Metrology Deputy 
     General Director Dr. Rashid Ahmad Bin Fahad.  Dr. Ahmad 
     said that his office is responsible for CODEX issues 
     but is unlikely to attend the CODEX Alimentarius 
     Commission (CAC) session in Rome. The UAE delegation 
     will likely be led by Halid Sharif, Food Control 
     Division Director for Dubai Municipality. 
 
     ¶2.  (SBU) The UAE has not yet decided who it will 
     support for CODEX Chairperson. If Sharif goes to the 
     CAC meeting, Dr. Ahmad will consult with him about our 
     request to support the candidacy of Mr. Gonzalo Rios 
     Kantorowitz.  However, according to Dr. Ahmad, the GCC 
     countries usually confer with each other on CODEX 
     matters and probably will back the same candidate. He 
     believes members of the GCC Food Control Committee 
     will attempt to interview the candidates and will make 
     a decision on whom to support just before the CAC 
     session.
