¶9. (C)  Iraq's Information Minister reported April 1 that 
coalition forces bombed a bus full of "human shield" peace 
activists traveling from Baghdad to Amman.  Neither Embassy 
nor TF-West has been able to substantiate this claim.  Voices 
in the Wilderness Amman representative Michael Birmingham 
telephoned the CLU after seeing the reports on the internet, 
but said he was unaware of any plans by his organization to 
travel at that time, aside from the 13 activists who arrived 
safely in Amman the evening of April 1 (ref a). 
 
¶10.  (C)  Local press have begun to take notice of an April 1 
AFP report that Jordan had arrested several Iraqis in 
connection with attempted terror attacks against a hotel and 
a U.S. military water supply (refs b and c).  We expect 
extensive coverage in local press on April 2.
