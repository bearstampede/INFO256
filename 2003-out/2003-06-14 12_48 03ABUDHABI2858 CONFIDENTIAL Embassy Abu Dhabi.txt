SUBJECT:  UAEG ASSURES HIGH-LEVEL PARTICIPATION FOR UN 
HOSTED CONSULTATIONS ON IRAQ'S RECONSTRUCTION 
 
REF: STATE 163448 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Acting DCM Thomas E. Williams, 
for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (U) This is an action request; please see 
paragraph 4. 
 
¶3.  (C) Acting DCM raised reftel points 6/14 with UAE 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Assistant Undersecretary 
for Political Affairs Abdullah Rashid Al-Nuami, who 
confirmed that he would attend the June 24 United 
Nations technical consultations along with UAE 
Ministry of Finance Assistant Undersecretary for 
Revenue and Budget Khalid Al-Bustani.  Other UAE 
officials may also be planning to attend; we will 
inform Washington agencies of the full delegation 
ASAP. 
 
¶4.  (C) Comment and action request: As a member of the 
informal working group on Iraq's reconstruction, the 
UAEG is strongly committed to Iraq's economic recovery 
and is looking to play a useful role.  Al-Nuami would 
appreciate the opportunity to meet appropriate U.S. 
officials on the sidelines of the United Nations 
meetings, including Undersecretary Alan Larson and DoD 
Comptroller Dr. Dov Zakheim, to further discuss UAE 
financial and humanitarian support to Baghdad, as well 
as broader Iraq political and security issues.  Al- 
Nuami indicated that he might be interested in a short 
side-trip to Washington should bilaterals not be 
convenient on the margins of the U.N. conference.  If 
so, we suggest that Al-Nuami also meet with new NEA 
Deputy Assistant Secretary Philo Dibble.  End comment 
and action request.
