¶1. (C)  The acting head of the Central Bank of Kuwait's 
Anti-Money Laundering Unit, Talal Alsayegh, told us November 
22 and December 1 that its investigation of the $85 million 
in Iraqi assets frozen in the Bahamas is not yet complete. 
Alsayegh said that the joint Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs/Central Bank investigatory team was still gathering 
information from some of the Kuwaiti banks involved. 
Although Alsayegh expects that the investigation will be 
completed soon, he did not give a specific deadline.  He also 
noted that he has been in direct contact with OFAC on this 
matter.  Post will continue to press the GOK for a timely 
decision.
