(C) On August 29, the Embassy relayed to the MFA reftel 
talking points regarding the September 3-4 CentAm 
Presidential Summit in Belize.  The MFA informed us that the 
GOG supports the Nicaraguan proposal, which reinforces the 
provisions of the 1995 Democratic Security Treaty of Central 
America.  The GOG sent its multilateral negotiating team to 
Belize on September 2 to participate in preliminary talks, 
and Foreign Minister Gutierrez and President Portillo are 
scheduled to depart for Belize on the afternoon of September 
Â¶3.  There was some doubt on August 29 whether the GOG would 
participate in the summit, following its decision to reject 
the findings of the OAS facilitators.  However, the MFA 
informed us on September 2 that President Portillo will 
participate in the summit.
