SUBJECT: NIGERIA: CHAMBAS BRIEFING ON ECOWAS MINISTERIAL 
 
 
REF: A. STATE 88288 
     ¶B. ABIDJAN 817 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) 
AND (D). 
 
 
¶1. On April 9, ECOWAS ExecSec Chambas briefed the 
diplomatic corps on the April 7 ECOWAS Ministerial in 
Abidjan.  The briefing was similar to the one he gave in 
Abijdan (REF B).  Stressing the need for immediate funding 
to ensure ECOMICI's continued viability, Chambas stated 
that he would join a quintet of ECOWAS Foreign Ministers 
(Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, and Guinea) to 
tour potential donor countries starting April 28.  See 
travel itinerary in paragraph 3. 
 
 
¶2. (C) On a pull aside after the briefing, A/DCM delivered 
demarche to Chambas (REF A).  A/DCM commented that ECOWAS 
should perhaps consider amending the travel schedule to 
include a donor conference.  As developed, the schedule 
would not accommodate the conference until late May at the 
earliest and most likely not until June.  Chambas was 
receptive to the idea of scheduling an earlier donor 
conference.

summit. 
 
 
¶4. Washington is scheduled for an April 29 visit.  Chambas 
said that he would provide the U.S. and other donors with a 
breakdown of the ECOWAS budget request prior to beginning 
the donor capital tour.

¶5.    Chambas said he had just come from a meeting with 
LURD representatives in Abuja.  The LURD representatives 
would next travel to Accra to meet President Kufuor on 
April 10.  Chambas noted that ECOWAS is considering asking 
one of two former Nigerian Heads of State to mediate 
between the GOL and the LURD (Chambas had previously 
mentioned Abdulsalaam to us; Chief Shonekan would be our 
educated guess as the other half of the tandem.).

COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
¶6.  (C) Chambas' statement that ECOMICI would increase to 
3,205 soldiers and expand its mandate to include monitoring 
of borders, disarmament, and protection of CDI officials 
raises questions of whether a force of this size can handle 
a mandate of this scope.  However, for now, the pressing 
concern for ECOWAS is to find the funds to maintain ECOMICI 
at any troop level.  This is where a donors conference 
could be instrumental and Chambas seemed to see the value 
of holding such a conference sooner rather than later.  END 
COMMENT.
