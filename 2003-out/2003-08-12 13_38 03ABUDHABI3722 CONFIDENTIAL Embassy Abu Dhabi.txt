Begin Text: 
 
H.E. Marcelle M. Wahba 
Ambassador 
Embassy of the United States of American 
Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates 
 
Your Excellency, 
 
Thank you for your letter of July 29, 2003, in which you 
raised a number of issues concerning the activities of the 
Zayed International Center for Coordination and Follow-up, 
Abu Dhabi. 
 
These issues have been given due consideration and His 
Highness President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan has 
asked me to convey his apologies for any misunderstanding 
that the Center's activities may have inadvertently 
contributed to. 
 
We would like to assure you that the Center does not 
represent the Government of the UAE or its people.  Neither 
does the Center represent the thoughts or views of His 
Highness the President, who strives to promote co-existence, 
cooperation and dialogue among nations, regardless of color, 
race or religion.  He encourages free practice of beliefs 
without any coercion or pressure. 
 
As you are aware, His Highness the President has sponsored, 
and continues to support, humanitarian and educational 
initiatives around the world which help bring about greater 
tolerance and understanding among its peoples.  The 
endowment to the Divinity School at Harvard University is 
just one example. 
 
In this context, we would like to inform you that 
appropriate measures have been taken in relation to the 
activities of the Center in order to ensure that such forums 
remain focused on its informational and educational 
objectives but do not become embroiled in controversies that 
adversely affect the reputation and standing of the UAE and 
its people, without infringing on the principles of freedom 
of speech and through which both our countries uphold. 
 
We appreciate your understanding of the issues and your role 
in enhancing the growing bilateral relationship and 
cooperation between our two friendly countries. 
 
Please accept our highest regards. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan 
Director-General 
Office of H.H. the President 
 
End Text.
