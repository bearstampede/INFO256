¶1. (S) Pol-Mil Counselor spoke with MFA Nato Department Fatih 
Celan February 8 regarding reftel request instructing Embassy 
and USNATO to coordinate with the GOT a formal Turkish 
request for Article IV consultations on February 10.  Celan 
said he did not know whether the GOT intended to submit a 
formal request for Article IV consultations on February 10. 
He added the MFA recently had authorized the Turkish mission 
at NATO to handle the Article IV issue, and suggested that 
USG contact the TU mission at NATO to inquire about Turkey's 
intentions for February 10. 
 
 
¶2. (S) Comment:  This information tracks closely with what we 
have heard from other MFA officials regarding the lead role 
that the TU mission at NATO (vice the MFA) is playing on 
Article IV consultations.  MFA DG for International Security 
Morali earlier told the DCM that the MFA had given the 
Turkish mission "a free hand" at NATO to proceed on Article 
IV matters.
