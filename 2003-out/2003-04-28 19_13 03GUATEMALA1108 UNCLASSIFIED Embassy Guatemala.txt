PolOff raised ref A points with Sylvia Corado, Director for 
Multilateral Affairs at the Foreign Ministry (MFA) on April 
¶25.  Corado said the MFA remains interested in subscribing to 
the International Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile 
Proliferation (ICOC), and hopes to do so in time to 
participate in the June meeting on implementation issues and 
confidence building measures.  Corado explained that the MFA 
had not responded to our earlier demarche (ref B), because 
paragraph 3 (a) of the ICOC requires subscribers to "ratify, 
accede to, or otherwise abide by" the terms of three treaties 
related to outer space.  Corado admitted the MFA has very 
little expertise in this area and needed to be sure it 
understood what it was signing.  Corado stressed that 
Guatemala supports the goal of non-proliferation.
