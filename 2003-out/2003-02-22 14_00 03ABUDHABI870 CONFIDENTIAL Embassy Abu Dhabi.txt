¶1. (U) Classified by DCM Richard Albright for reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2. (C) Econchief delivered reftel demarche on the benefits 
of joining a multilateral open skies aviation regime on 
2/22 to UAE Ministry of Communications Assistant 
Undersecretary for Civil Aviation Mohamed Yahya 
Al-Suweidi. Al-Suweidi responded, "at first glance, it is 
not a bad idea," but said he must study further the 
information provided before taking a position.  (Comment: 
The UAEG has signed, or is in the process of signing, 
bilateral open skies agreements with nearly every country 
listed in reftel as a party to the multilateral regime, 
which may limit the perception of the benefits of 
joining.  End comment.) 
 
¶3. (C) Al-Suweidi is aware that the multilateral open 
skies regime may be a topic at the next U.S.-GCC Economic 
Dialogue, and said he will be prepared to discuss it with 
others in the GCC beforehand.
