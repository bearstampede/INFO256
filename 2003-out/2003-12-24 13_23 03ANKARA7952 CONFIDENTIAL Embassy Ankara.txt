TAGS: PREL MOPS MARR TU IZ
SUBJECT: IRAQ: TURKISH DELEGATION TO PULSE IRAQIS 
 
 
Classified by A/DCM James Moore.  Reasons 1.5 b and d. 
 
 
¶1. (C) This is an action request.  See para 3. 
 
 
¶2. (C) MFA DDG for Mideast Affairs Safak Gokturk called 
PolMilCouns 12/24 to inform him that a GOT delegation was 
planning to travel to Iraq on a fact-finding mission to meet 
with a broad range of contacts. Planning for the trip was in 
the initial stages, but Gokturk said the visit would likely 
occur after January 9.  Gokturk cited a suggestion apparently 
posed by DepSecDef Wolfowitz to MFA U/S Ziyal during the 
latter's recent visit to Washington -- that Turkish officials 
may be able to elicit from Iraqis a more complete opinion on 
the US occupation than Iraqis might be willing to offer 
directly to US officials.  Gokturk said he was instructed to 
ask whether there were any specific questions or issues on 
which the USG would like the delegation to pulse Iraqis.  He 
asked that we submit our inquiries to him by January 3, if 
possible.  If not, sometime the week of January 5. 
 
 
¶3. (C) Action Request: Please provide questions/issues 
Washington and/or Baghdad would like the Turks to raise with 
the Iraqis. 
 
 
¶4. (U) Baghdad Minimize Considered.
