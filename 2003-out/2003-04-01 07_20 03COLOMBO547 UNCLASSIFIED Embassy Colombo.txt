SUBJECT: SRI LANKA DEMONSTRATION ACTIVITY 
 
 
  ¶1.   (U) On March 28, 2003, approximately 2000 people 
     protested the U.S. position on Iraq.  The demonstration was 
     organized by the left-wing JVP political party, but 
     according to the police, principally attended by Sri Lankan 
     Muslims.  The protesters were given permission to congregate 
     no further than a site approximately one kilometer from the 
     Embassy.  The group did, however, exceed the permissible 
     protest area and attempted to march to the Emabassy. 
 
  ¶2.   (U) The police prevented the demonstrators from 
     approaching the Chancery.  As the crowd did not readily 
     respond to police instructions, the police used water 
     cannons and dispensed 15 canisters of tear gas to force the 
     crowd to disperse.  According to the Deputy Inspector 
     General of Police (DIG) present at the scene, one of the 
     canisters did not detonate and was thrown back at the police 
     where the gas was released. The DIG was slightly injured and 
     was taken to a hospital for medical treatment. 
 
  ¶3.   (U) The Embassy also received unconfirmed reports of 
     demonstrations in at least six other locations in the 
     country.  No violence was reported and no reliable numbers 
     are available. 
 
  ¶4.   (U) Post continues to closely monitor demonstration 
     activity - particularly to see if numbers grow and violence 
     begins to permeate.
