¶1.  (U) Classified by Charge d'Affaires, a.i. Richard A. 
Albright for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (C) Charge d'Affaires urged UAE Central Bank Governor 
Sultan Nasser Al-Suweidi on August 27 to check carefully 
for offices or financial assets of individuals and 
charities designated in ref B for asset-freezing under U.S. 
Executive order.  Al-Suweidi responded that the Central 
Bank had searched the UAE banking system for HAMAS-related 
assets as recently as March 2003, but would investigate the 
list of new names and entities that Post provided (ref A). 
 
¶3.  (C) The Governor also noted that investigating HAMAS- 
related assets in the UAE is "very sensitive" and has 
"security implications."  Al-Suweidi said he would inform 
us of any actions or blocking of assets the UAE Central 
Bank undertakes.
