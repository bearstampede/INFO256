SUBJECT: SMART UPDATE 
 
REF: 02 STATE 195704 
 
¶1.  Please provide wide dissemination of the information 
in this telegram. 
 
¶2.  Reftel described steps the Department is taking to 
implement a new integrated messaging system: SMART (State 
Messaging and Archive Retrieval Toolset).  We have made 
substantial progress and are looking for your input as we 
move forward. 
 
¶3.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) to design SMART was 
released to the vendor community in late June, and 
proposals were submitted September 2, 2003.  The 
description of SMART requirements in the RFQ is based in 
great part on the feedback received from a wide range of 
Department employees over the past year: from evaluators 
of the proof-of-concept prototype, to those who sent in 
comments to the SMART website, to participants in focus 
groups and members of working groups. 
 
¶4.  The technical evaluation team, consisting of 
representatives of different bureaus, offices and posts 
under the leadership of Ambassador James Holmes, IRM's 
Chief Knowledge Officer and DCIO, evaluated the vendor 
proposals against the established technical criteria. The 
cost evaluation team met and evaluated the vendor 
proposals against the established cost criteria. 
 
¶5. The recommendation arising from the evaluation process 
will now go to the Steering Committee for Messaging and 
InterAgency Collaboration, chaired by Ambassador Joe Lake. 
This committee, which includes senior level substantive, 
management and technical representatives of many bureaus, 
will recommend up to three vendors. 
 
¶6. The companies selected will each design and demonstrate 
a fully functioning solution, which, in turn, will be 
evaluated early in the new calendar year (2004). A vendor 
will then be selected to produce a pilot for the new 
system. The pilot will involve parts of one geographic 
(EUR) and one functional (DS) bureau, and associated 
overseas posts.  Once the pilot is evaluated, full 
implementation is expected in 2005. 
 
¶7.  We will continue to keep you informed as we move 
through this complex process.  Your comments, concerns and 
recommendations are welcome at every stage.  We encourage 
you to check the SMART website regularly for up to date 
information.  Website addresses are: 
http://smart.state.gov (Intranet), 
http://smart.state.sgov.gov(Classified) and 
http://smart (PDNet). 
 
¶8.  Minimize considered.
