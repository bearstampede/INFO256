 ¶1.  (C)  Per ref A, we again contacted GODR Deputy Director 
for the Americas, Roger Espaillat, to inquire if the GODR has 
any substantive comment on the Statement of Interdiction 
Principles adopted by the Proliferation Security Initiative 
participants.  Espaillat replied that the GODR generally 
supports measures to curb proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and is a good friend of the USG, but declined 
further substantive comment.  He promised a more thorough 
response via diplomatic note in the near future (to be 
reported septel).
