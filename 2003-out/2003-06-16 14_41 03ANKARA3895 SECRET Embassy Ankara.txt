¶2.  (C) Econoff conveyed names and background paper in reftel 
to Hakan Okcal, Director General for Research and 
Intelligence at the Foreign Ministry in a June 16 meeting. 
Noting the need to keep the information close hold until June 
19, Okcal undertook to pass it on to relevant offices in the 
Ministries of Finance and Justice for immediate review.  He 
stressed, however, that given that the planned U.S. action 
will occur outside of a United Nations framework, Turkey 
could only follow suit through judicial rather than 
administrative proceedings.
