¶1. (C) Summary: ICRC expects to visit Aung San Suu Kyi and 
the other detained NLD leaders within the next few days. 
Meanwhile, the universities have reopened and Rangoon remains 
quiet. End Summary. 
 
ICRC To See ASSK and Other NLD Leaders 
 
¶2. (C) ICRC officers have advised us that ICRC has been given 
permission to see Aung San Suu Kyi and the other NLD leaders 
who were detained following the May 30 ambush in Depeyin. 
ICRC officials are to meet with GOB representatives today or 
tommorow to work out the modalities for the visits, which 
will probably take place during the weekend of June 21 and 22. 
 
Detainees Released 
 
¶3. (U) In a diplomatic note dated June 13, the GOB said that 
it had released 46 persons who had been detained in 
connection with the May 30 attack in Depeyin.  Twenty-five 
people were released on June 11; 21 on June 12.  Apparently, 
however, none of the persons released were picked up at the 
scene of the attack.  From information we have been able to 
gather, all appear to have been detained after the event as 
the GOB searched for signs of a conspiracy. 
 
Universities Open; Rangoon Quiet 
 
¶4. (C) Universities and secondary schools reopened throughout 
Burma on June 16.  Thus far, the country remains quiet.  With 
the exception of a very few small and isolated 
demonstrations, the public has not taken to the streets to 
protest the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi or the closure of 
the NLD offices.  Some preliminary security arrangements have 
been put in place in Rangoon (e.g.; some additional barbed 
wire at Rangoon's city hall and a few more MI surveillance 
units on the street), but there are no signs yet that the 
government anticipates any serious trouble.
