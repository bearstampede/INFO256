SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZED DEPARTURE 
 
REF: A. AMMAN 1335 B. STATE 061032 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNEHM, REASONS 1.5B AND D 
 
¶1.  (S) AmEmbassy Amman was placed on Authorized Departure 
beginning February 8, 2003 and the current extension of 
that status expires on April 7, 2003. Security concerns 
have increased since the start of the war with Iraq. 
GoJ authorities recently arrested Iraqis involved in a 
terrorist attack against American interests in 
Jordan. Other potential threats from Al Qaeda, other 
regional organizations, or indigenous groups angered by 
Iraq or the Israel-Palestinian confrontation remain a 
matter of concern as well.  Post has gone to "standfast" 
condition twice in the past month and employee movements 
within Jordan, and even Amman proper, are tightly 
restricted. 
 
¶2.  (C) I request, therefore, that the Authorized Departure 
status for Jordan be extended for an additional 30 days 
through May 7, 2003.  The Post's Emergency Action 
Committee unanimously supports this requested action. 
Regards. 
GNEHM
