SUBJECT: WFP AND UNICEF SHIPMENTS TO NORTHERN IRAQ, UN 
PERSONNEL ISSUES IN TURKEY 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Three WFP successfully crossed the 
Turkish-Iraqi border on 29 March and continued on to a UN 
warehouse in northern Iraq.  Two UNICEF trucks carrying 
non-food items are currently on the border awaiting clearance 
to cross.  In another development, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA) presented a Note Verbale to the UN Resident 
Coordinator on 28 March requesting information on UN 
employees involved in humanitarian activities in Turkey, and 
asking that the UN in Turkey not employ individuals who had 
recently worked in Iraq.  End summary. 
 
 
¶2. (U) On 29 March three WFP trucks with 60 metric tons of 
wheat, soy and milk powder crossed the Turkish-Iraqi border. 
WFP had not received all the proper clearances from the 
government of Turkey, and there was a three day delay in 
crossing.  Clearances were received on 28 March and, after 
spending three hours at Turkish customs, the trucks crossed 
the border and traveled on to a WFP warehouse in Dohuk. 
 
 
¶3. (U) WFP will begin loading a shipment of 1,000 metric tons 
(approximately 50 trucks) of wheat flour for northern Iraq on 
31 March.  Paperwork for this shipment has already been 
submitted to the MFA and the Coordination Center in 
Diyarbakir.  WFP feels that this should avoid delays.  This 
is a critical shipment to start important food flows into 
northern Iraq.  This particular shipment is targeted for 
Dohuk, where WFP has determined there is a shortage of wheat 
flour.  Prior to the outbreak of war, the majority of Iraq 
received multiple rations of flour, while the Kurdish area 
received only multiple rations of vegetable oil.  The 
shipment currently being loaded will be part of 6,000 metric 
tons that the MFA has approved for WFP to bring into Iraq. 
 
 
¶4. (U) Two UNICEF trucks carrying non-food items arrived at 
the Turkish-Iraqi border on 30 March.  The trucks are 
awaiting clearance to cross the border.  UNICEF reported to 
DART staff currently in southeast Turkey that they have 
approximately 400 truckloads worth of medicines, emergency 
supplies (blankets, tents, mattresses, hygiene kits, kitchen 
sets, clothes, water treatment equipment and school 
supplies).  Two hundred of those trucks are in Mersin. 
UNICEF states that all of these commodities are enough to 
assist one-third of Iraq. 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) The MFA presented a Note Verbale on 28 March to the 
United Nations Resident Coordinator requesting that he 
provide the MFA with information on UN personnel involved in 
humanitarian operations in Turkey.  The Resident Coordinator 
is to provide identity particulars, dates of arrival in 
Turkey, whether the personnel have residence and employment 
permits, what countries the employees have served in, and the 
particular function of the employees. 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Note Verbale goes on to say quote it would also 
be appreciated if the UN agencies could kindly avoid 
employing personnel who have recently served in Iraq unquote. 
 While this may affect the whole UN structure in Turkey, it 
has a great effect on WFP.  WFP currently employs a large 
number of individuals with previous experience in Iraq, 
including the newly-arrived WFP Emergency Coordinator.  The 
UN is discussing how to respond to the Note. 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment: In a 28 March conversation with the MDRO, 
MFA implied that the GOT would not go after all UN staff in 
Turkey with recent experience in Iraq, but they did register 
a definite objection to the assignment of a new Emergency 
Coordinator, who most recently served in Erbil.
