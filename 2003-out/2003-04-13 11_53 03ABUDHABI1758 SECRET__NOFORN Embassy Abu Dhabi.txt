SUBJECT:  TFIZ01 (EAC): ABU DHABI SITREP NO. 17, APRIL 13 
 
REF: ABU DHABI 1726 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
---------------- 
General Overview 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) COM convened Abu Dhabi's Iraq Task Force/core 
Emergency Action Committee (EAC) at 0915 local time, 4/13. 
Embassy Abu Dhabi, FCS (located outside of the Embassy 
compound), and the USGS office in Al Ain are open 4/13 with

SECURITY 
-------- 
 
¶3.  (S/NF) ORCA reported no new threats or additional 
developments on previous warnings. 
 
¶4.  (C) RSO reported that the test results on the white 
powder found in the Embassy mail room last week were not 
yet complete by the UAE authorities. 
 
¶5.  (C) RSO also reported that the Abu Dhabi police had 
recently increased the number of marked and undercover 
units patrolling neighborhoods where Embassy personnel 
reside. 
 
----------------------- 
UAEG Actions/Statements 
----------------------- 
 
¶6.   (C) ECON reported that the Red Crescent Authority 
wants to fly medical and humanitarian supplies into Baghdad 
Airport, following the Kuwaiti example. The Embassy is 
coordinating with the HOC in Kuwait, the RCA, and U.S. 
military forces at Al Minhad, to see if this is feasible. 
The UAE RCA ship Al Manar reached Umm Qasr on Friday 4/11. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Local Media 
----------------------------------

will be the next U.S. target.  Newspapers widely reported 
that coalition forces only protected the Ministry of 
Petroleum in Baghdad, allowing looters to ransack the rest 
of the city and reinforcing the belief the war was about 
oil.

1000 local time, 4/14. 
 
¶9.  (U) Iraq Task Force/EAC members in attendance included
