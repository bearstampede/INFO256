SUBJECT: DAILY NEWS BASES ARTICLE ON WASHINGTON FILE 
 
 
  ¶1.   The privately owned "Daily News" published an 
      article in its February 5, 2003 edition that was based 
      on two Washington File articles (AEF501 and AEF504) 
      from January 31.  The page-4 article was published 
      under the title "Mubako admits crisis man-made" and 
      acknowledged the "Washington File" as the source for 
      the information.  The article offered readers 
      information about how their Ambassador to the US 
      defended Zimbabwean policies at the January 29 U.S. 
      Institute of Peace program on "What Future for Mugabe's 
      Zimbabwe." 
 
  ¶2.   Economic and political pressures in Zimbabwe tend 
      to deprive average citizens of information from outside 
      of the country.  The Washington File's reporting on 
      Zimbabwe-related events in the U.S. help penetrate the 
      news "cone of silence" in which many Zimbabweans 
      languish.  We are grateful for the two Washington File 
      stories cited above and look forward to more of this 
      crucial support to keeping Zimbabweans informed.
