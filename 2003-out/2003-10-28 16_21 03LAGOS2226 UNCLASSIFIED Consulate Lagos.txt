SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AIRPORT OPERATIONS MOSTLY BACK TO 
NORMAL 
 
REF: LAGOS 2198 
 
 
¶1. (U) Power at Lagos' Murtala Mohammed International 
Airport has yet to be fully restored after last 
Thursday's electrical fire (reftel), but airport 
operations are mostly back to normal.  Regular flights 
have resumed, and passengers are again checking in at 
the airport's international terminal.  Airlines are 
trying to minimize the delays of manual check-ins by 
starting hours earlier than usual.  Luggage collection 
is slightly delayed (only one conveyor is working), but 
airline staff are coping by calling passengers' names 
and distributing bags by hand. 
 
 
¶2. (U) Airport authorities expect operations to return 
to normal early next week.
