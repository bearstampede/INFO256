SUBJECT: CANADA OPPOSED TO IRAQ DISCUSSION IN OTHER UN FORA 
 
REF: A. STATE 70678 B. USUN 710 
 
Classified By: POL/MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). 
 
1.(C)  On March 18, POL/MC delivered points in Ref A to 
Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) Political Director Jim Wright, urging Canada's 
support in keeping the Iraq debate out of the UNGA and UNCHR. 
Wright pledged that Canada will not be drawn into such UN 
"side shows" and will work, as appropriate, to discourage 
such initiatives on the part of others.  Canada's record in 
promoting the UNCHR as a forum for serious debate was as 
solid as they come, and it believed that any UNGA special 
session on Iraq would serve no useful purpose. 
 
Â¶2. (C)  Referring to Foreign Minister Graham's telephone 
conversation yesterday evening with Secretary Powell, Wright 
reiterated that the GOC understood the reasons why the U.S. 
needed to move forward on Iraq and would not engage in 
criticism and second-guessing.  The GOC was looking beyond 
the conflict, which it hoped would be mercifully short, and 
hoped for a quick transition to a post-confict phase in which 
it intended to do its part in a, UN-led reconstruction 
effort.
