PAGE 03        ROME  01601  01 OF 05  151122Z 
BACKGROUND: THE FC REVIEWS THE REPORT ON BUDGETARY 
PERFORMANCE FOR 2002 TO ENSURE THAT THE DIRECTOR GENERAL 
HAS MANAGED THE APPROPRIATIONS SO AS TO ENSURE THAT 
ADEQUATE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO MEET EXPENDITURES DURING 
THE BIENNIUM.  TRANSFERS FROM ONE CHAPTER TO ANOTHER MUST 
BE APPROVED BY THE FC.  THE 102ND SESSION WILL BE 
INFORMED OF THE LIKELY MAGNITUDE OF SUCH BUDGET 
TRANSFERS, BUT THE FORMAL REQUEST FOR TRANSFERS WILL NOT 
BE SUBMITTED UNTIL THE SEPTEMBER 2003 FC MEETING. 
 
FOR DISCUSSION: 
 
--  MANAGING APPROPRIATIONS: THE 2002 SPENDING REPRESENTS 
50.1 PERCENT OF THE USD 651.8 MILLION APPROPRIATION FOR 
2002-03.  FULL UTILIZATION OF THE APPROPRIATION IS 
FORESEEN IN THE BIENNIUM. 
 
-- TRANSFERS:  THE FAO IS EXPERIENCING A SHARP DECLINE IN 
SUPPORT COST EARNINGS AS A RESULT OF THE CONTINUED 
REDUCTION IN NON-EMERGENCY EXTRA-BUDGETARY PROJECTS.  THE 
SHORTFALL IS ESTIMATED AT USD 6.2 MILLION OVER THE 
BIENNIUM.  TRANSFERS WILL BE NEEDED TO COVER FIXED STAFF 
COSTS PREVIOUSLY COVERED BY SUPPORT COST INCOME. 
 
FODAG COMMENT:  THE DOWNWARD TREND OF SUPPORT COST INCOME 
AND ITS BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS REQUIRE GREATER MANAGEMENT 
ATTENTION.

¶19.  SUMMARY PROGRAM OF WORK AND BUDGET (SPWB) 2004-05 
(DOC CL 124/3) 
 
BACKGROUND: THE FC IS REQUESTED TO EXAMINE THE "FINANCIAL

PAGE 03        ROME  01601  03 OF 05  151123Z 
ASPECTS" OF THE SPWB, INCLUDING COST INCREASES, IMPACT OF 
EXCHANGE RATES, ETC. 
 
DISCUSSION: 
 
-- THE SPWB PROVIDES ZERO REAL GROWTH (ZRG) AND REAL 
GROWTH (RG) SCENARIOS. 
 
-- THE ZRG BUDGET REPRESENTS A NET INCREASE OF 5.2 
PERCENT OVER THE CURRENT ASSESSMENT. 
 
-- THE RG BUDGET REPRESENTS A NET INCREASE OF 11 PERCENT 
OVER THE CURRENT ASSESSMENT. 
 
-- THE SPWB NOTES THAT UNFUNDED LIABILITIES FOR AFTER 
SERVICE MEDICAL CARE, IF NOT ATTENDED TO SHORTLY "WILL 
HAVE A SEVERE DEBILITATING EFFECT ON THE FINANCES OF FAO 
IN COMING YEARS."  FAO MEMBERS ARE ASKED TO ACCOMMODATE 
THIS BY INCREASING ASSESSED CONTRIBUTIONS BY AN 
ADDITIONAL USD 14.1 MILLION (A FURTHER 2.2 PERCENT.) 
 
-- THE SPWB ALSO NOTES THAT, AT RECENT EXCHANGE RATES, 
THE BUDGET EXPRESSED IN USD WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY USD 56 
MILLION MORE.  HOWEVER, THE INTRODUCTION TO THE SPWB 
EXPRESSES THE DG'S EXPECATION THAT THE FC WILL RESOLVE 
THIS QUESTION BY AOPTING A SPLIT CURRENCY ASSESSMENT. 
 
DEPARTMENT UIDANCE REQUESTED ON FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF THE 
SPB, INCLUDING OVERALL BUDGET LEVEL.

BACKGROUD: THE FC HAS HAD THIS ITEM UNDER CONSIDERATION

TO BE CONVINCED THAT A SPLIT ASSESSMENT SCHEM IS THE 
BEST WAY TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF EXCHAGE RATE 
EXPOSURE.  THE FC WILL BE REQUESTED TO EDORSE THE 
PROPOSALS TO IMPLEMENT SPLIT ASSESSMENTWITH A VIEW TO 
HAVING THE FAO BASIC TEXTS AMENDE AT THE NOVEMBER 2003

GENERAL SERVICE BY 39 PERCENT.  THE DECREASE IN PROJECT 
STAFF (71 PERCENT) REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF

CONSTANT OVER THE LAST DECADE: 42 YEARS ON APPOINTMENT, 
52 YEARS ON SEPARATION.  SEVENTY-NINE PERCENT OF FAO

VI.  ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS 
--------------------------- 
 
¶26.  AGENDA ITEM 26, METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINATION OF 
EQUITABLE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION (CL DOC 124/15) 
 
BACKGROUND:  INITIALLY A REQUEST BY THE LATIN AMERICAN 
GROUP AT THE LAST CONFERENCE TO EXAMINE OTHER 
METHODOLOGIES.  THE FAO HAS NOW PREPARED TWO ALTERNATIVES 
FOR THE FC TO CONSIDER. 
 
-- UNDER BOTH OPTIONS A BASE NUMBER OF POSTS (RATHER THAN 
THE POSTS FILLED AT ANY GIVEN TIME) WOULD BE USED FOR 
CALCULATIONS.  (THIS IS SIMILAR WITH UN METHODOLOGY). 
 
-- IN ADDITION, FAO PROPOSES TO INCREASE BY 341 THE 
NUMBER OF POSTS THAT WOULD BE COUNTED UNDER GEOGRAPHICAL 
DISTRIBUTION WHILE STILL EXCLUDING POSTS FUNDED FROM 
VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS, LANGUAGE STAFF AND THE DIRECTOR 
GENERAL. (COMMENT: IT IS UNCLEAR WHY THE POSTS WERE 
FORMERLY NOT COUNTED.  END COMMENT) 
 
-- THE "WEIGHTING" SYSTEM WHEREBY POINTS ARE GIVEN FOR 
HIGHER LEVEL POSITIONS WOULD BE ALTERED TO BE COMPARABLE 
WITH THAT OF THE UN AND UNESCO. THIS WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY 
REDUCE THE WEIGHT GIVEN TO HIGHER-RANKING POSITIONS (E.G. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01601  04 OF 05  151123Z 
15 POINTS FOR THE DDG IN THE OLD SYSTEM WOULD BECOME ONLY 
4.3 POINTS IN THE NEW SYSTEM). 
 
COMMENT: THE FIRST OPTION INCREASES THE NUMBER OF 
"UNDERREPRESENTED COUNTRIES" SLIGHTLY.  THE SECOND OPTION 
(WHICH FACTORS IN POPULATION SIZE) DRAMATICALLY REDUCES 
THE NUMBER OF "OVER-REPRESENTED" COUNTRIES.  BOTH OPTIONS 
WOULD APPEAR TO BE DETRIMENTAL TO U.S. EFFORTS TO IMPROVE 
REPRESENTATION (WITH THE SECOND BEING ESPECIALLY SO, AS 
THE NUMBER OF OVERREPRESENTED COUNTRIES WOULD BE REDUCED 
FROM 77 TO 12), DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE NEW SYSTEM 
MIGHT ALSO MOVE THE U.S. CLOSER TO "EQUITABLE" 
REPRESENTATION. 
 
GUIDANCE REQUESTED:  USDEL CONSIDERS BOTH OPTIONS 
PROBLEMATIC FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF U.S. REPRESENTATION.
