¶1. (U) Local press reports on 3/26 noted the visit of the 
acting Minister of Oil, Sheikh Ahmed Al-Fahed Al-Sabah to the 
Ratqa oil field where he met with the Kuwait oil firefighting 
team.  The press report notes the cooperation of the Kuwaiti 
team with an American team could result in all the fires in 
the Rumaila field being extinguished within ten days.  The 
report also states that work was delayed 3 hours on Tuesday 
because of poor weather; no work was scheduled for Wednesday 
to allow the teams to integrate their efforts. 
¶2. (C/NF) Embassy notes that despite earlier statements that 
KOC would increase production from the Ratqa field in 
northern Kuwait by up to 30,000 bpd in order to reduce 
reservoir pressure and advance firefighting efforts in the 
southern Rumaila field, KOC numbers over the last few days 
have shown a drop in production from the north.  When Embassy 
began receiving KOC reports, KOC North production was 423,432 
bbls (March 17).  Today's figure for KOC North is almost 5.5% 
below that (400,265 bbls).  Separately, post notes that 
stocks of Kuwait Export Crude have grown from 4,502,279 bbls 
on March 17 to 5,816,692 bbls on March 26 - a 29% increase in 
nine days.  While we suspect this is well within normal 
operating limits, it could also be interpreted as a slowing 
of regularly scheduled tanker loadings.  Post is seeking 
clarifications on these issues.
