SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION U. S. POLICY TOWARDS ZIM UNDER 
FIRE; HARARE 
 
  ¶1.   Under headline "U. S. taking out carrot and stick once 
      again" the July 3 edition of the independent daily "The 
      Daily News" carried an op-ed by Kuthula Matshazi on page 8 
      that was critical of the United States policy towards 
      Zimbabwe.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .The carrot-and-stick principle that Powell 
      proposes is very ludicrous and derogatory to a 
      people's status.  It assumes that money is the fixer 
      of everything.  Never.  And Bush and Powell know 
      that too.  You can't buy us so cheap, Bush and 
      Powell.  Sure, there are problems in Zimbabwe, but I 
      do not think that we need America to come and 
      interfere in our affairs.  As events and time have 
      shown, only the power of the people can solve the 
      problems of Zimbabwe.  Not American money and 
      politics. . . ."
