SUBJECT:  UAE PRESIDENT SHEIKH ZAYED: HEALTH UPDATE 
 
Ref: Albright-Jones 10/16/03 e-mail 
 
(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, Reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (S) The Ambassador learned from MinState for Foreign 
Affairs and (newly appointed) Deputy Prime Minister 
Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan that his father, 
President Zayed, had an operation the morning of October 
19 and was resting comfortably in a private wing of a UAE 
hospital in London.  President Zayed is accompanied by 
his wife, Sheikha Fatima, and two of his sons, Sheikh 
Mansour and Sheikh Hazaa. 
 
¶2. (S) According to Sheikh Hamdan, who met with the 
Ambassador the evening of October 19, the surgeons had to 
remove the entire gall bladder because there were too 
many stones.  Therefore, it seems the President underwent 
invasive surgery and not just a laser procedure to remove 
stones, as Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Armed Forces COS 
and one of Sheikh Hamdan's older brothers, told the 
Ambassador October 16 (see reftel).  Sheikh Hamdan said 
his father had been in a lot of pain and discomfort with 
the gall bladder stones that made it difficult for him to 
move.  Physicians said he could leave the hospital as 
early as the next day (Oct. 20), but Sheikh Hamdan said 
the family wants President Zayed to stay in the hospital 
for a few days.
