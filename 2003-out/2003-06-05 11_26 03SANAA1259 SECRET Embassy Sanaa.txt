¶1.  (S/NF)  On May 28, PolOff delivered the USG response 
(para 2) to ROYG's 4/29 request for information on Iraqis 
requesting asylum to Yemen to Abdul Hakim al-Iryani, Advisor 
to Foreign Minister Qirbi.  Iryani noted that the asylum 
requests were still under review, and agreed to contact the 
Embassy when ROYG reaches a decision. 
 
¶2.  (S rel Yemen)  Text of non-paper delivered to the MFA: 
 
-- We are very concerned about three individuals who have 
requested asylum:  Faysal Bandar Hussayn, his spouse Nahid 
Mahir 'Ali, and 'Abd Al-Sattar 'Izz Al-Din Mahmud Al-Rawi. 
 
--  We have information which indicates that Faysal Bandar 
Hussayn was very close to Saddam, and that his wife was a 
relative of Saddam's.  Both are Tikritis.  Therefore, we 
strongly urge your government to deny the asylum requests of 
these individuals. 
 
-- We also have information that 'Abd Al-Sattar 'Izz Al-Din 
Mahmud Al-Rawi is a senior Iraqi Intelligence Service Officer 
and may have committed war crimes and/or crimes against 
humanity.  We also believe this individual should not be 
granted asylum.
