¶1. (SBU) US MISSION REVIEWED WITH FAO ON MAY 6 THE STATUS OF 
FAO PLANS TO RESUSCITATE ITS INTERVENTIONS IN IRAQ, AND 
PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTHERN GOVERNORATES. FAO INTERNATIONAL 
STAFF IS BEING REDEPLOYED IN INCREASING NUMBERS - SOME 50 
WILL BE POSITIONED IN THE NORTHERN SECTOR BY-MID JUNE. FAO 
(AS A RESULT OF UNSC 1472 AND 1476) HAS REVIEWED SOME USD 
1.5 BILLION IN CONTRACTS RELATED TO IMPORTATION OF AG- 
RELATED GOODS, BUT HAS PRIORITIZED ONLY USD 81 MILLION AS 
CONTRACTS "DOABLE" BEFORE THE JUNE 3 DEADLINE. IN ADDITION, 
UNDER THE TERMS OF THE "13 PERCENT ACCOUNT," FAO HAS 
APPROXIMATELY USD 215 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR EXPENDITURE, 
SUBJECT TO AN OIP "GO-AHEAD" FROM THE UNSC. US MISSION WILL 
ENDEAVOR TO HELP ADDRESS FAO-USG COMMUNICATION ISSUES AND 
IDENTIFY THE PRIME ENTITIES ON THE U.S. SIDE TO SERVE AS 
CONDUITS FOR FAO INFORMATION/INQUIRIES. END SUMMARY.

BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) ON MAY 6, 2003, FODAG MISSION REPS TIM LAVELLE 
(USAID), ANITA MENGHETTI (USAID), AND KATIE NISHIURA 
(USDA/FAS) MET WITH LAURENT THOMAS, CHIEF, SPECIAL EMERGENCY 
PROGRAMMES SERVICE, EMERGENCY OPERATIONS AND REHABILITATION 
DIVISION, FAO, REGARDING FAO'S ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION 
IN IRAQ AND PROSPECTS FOR RENEWED FAO ACTIVITIES IN THAT 
COUNTRY.  THOMAS SAID IT WAS TIME FOR FAO TO GET "BACK IN 
BUSINESS IN IRAQ" AND EXPRESSED EAGERNESS FOR HIS FIELD 
STAFF TO RESUME ACTIVITIES ON THE GROUND. HE ALSO INDICATED 
THAT FAO WAS BEGINNING TO PREPARE FOR HANDING OVER 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT TO THE NEW 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  02102  01 OF 04  141628Z 
GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR. 
 
¶3. (SBU) THOMAS PROVIDED A SNAPSHOT OF FAO'S FINANCIAL 
PICTURE VIS-A-VIS IRAQ. THOMAS REPORTED THAT UNDER THE OIL- 
FOR-FOOD PROGRAM, FAO (AS A RESULT OF UNSC 1472 AND LATER 
1476) HAS REVIEWED SOME USD 1.5 BILLION IN CONTRACTS RELATED 
TO IMPORTATION OF AG-RELATED GOODS, BUT HAS PRIORITIZED ONLY 
USD 81 MILLION AS CONTRACTS "DOABLE" BEFORE THE JUNE 3 
DEADLINE. THOMAS COMMENTED THAT IF THERE IS AN EXTENSION OF 
UNSC 1476 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2003, THEN FAO WOULD BE ABLE TO 
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF "DOABLE" CONTRACTS UP TO AROUND USD 
200 MILLION IN AGRICULTURAL OFF IMPORTS. BEYOND THIS, FAO, 
UNDER THE TERMS OF THE "13 PERCENT ACCOUNT," HAS 
APPROXIMATELY USD 215 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR EXPENDITURE, 
SUBJECT TO AN OIP "GO-AHEAD" FROM THE UNITED NATIONS 
SECURITY COUNCIL (UNSC). NOTE: FAO IS CONCERNED THAT THESE 
FUNDS CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE SO AS NOT TO DISRUPT ON GOING 
AND PLANNED AGRICULTURAL INTERVENTIONS. AS PER FAO, MOST OF 
THE LOCAL NORTHERN GOVERNORATE AUTHORITIES SHARE THIS VIEW. 
END NOTE.

¶5. (SBU) THOMAS EXPRESSED A STRONG DESIRE TO STREAMLINE 
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN FAO AND THE USG AND TO COOPERATE WITH 
U.S. AGRICULTURAL AND DEVELOPMENT OFFICIALS IN IRAQ.  HE

NORTHERN IRAQ 
------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) AN INITIAL GROUP OF FAO INTERNATIONAL STAFF ENTERED 
NORTHERN IRAQ THIS PAST WEEK AND BY MID-JUNE FAO PLANS TO 
HAVE 50 INTERNATIONALS IN PLACE.  DUE TO THE LACK OF DAMAGE 
DURING THE WAR, ESTABLISHED RELATIONS BETWEEN FAO STAFF AND 
LOCALS, AND THE EXISTING FAO INFRASTRUCTURE, THOMAS EXPECTS 
RESUMPTION OF WORK IN THE NORTHERN GOVERNORATES TO BE "AN 
EASY JOB." 
 
¶7. (SBU) FAO PLANS TO RELEASE A THREE-YEAR BLUEPRINT FOR THE 
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN THE NORTH THIS WEEK.  THE PLAN 
REPRESENTS THE ACCUMULATED KNOW HOW OF THE FAO IN THAT PART 
OF THE COUNTRY, AND FAO HOPES TO STIMULATE ACTION WITH ITS 
"ROLL OUT."  FAO ALSO PLANS TO RELEASE OVER THE NEXT TWO 
WEEKS A SERIES OF REPORTS ON A VARIETY OF AGRICULTURAL 
TOPICS, E.G., THOMAS SHOWED US A TWO-INCH THICK DRAFT REPORT 
ON THE HYDROGEOLOGY OF NORTHERN IRAQ. SIMILAR STUDIES 
ENCOMPASS THE LIVESTOCK SECTOR, AGRICULTURAL SECTOR 
REHABILITATION, AND SO ON. 
 
¶8. (SBU) FAO ACTIVITIES IN THE NORTH PRESENTLY DEPEND UPON 
OIL-FOR-FOOD (OFF) RESOURCES.  THOMAS HOPES FOR/ANTICIPATES 
AN EXTENSION OF SCR 1472/76 FUNDING FOR AGRICULTURAL 
DEVELOPMENT AT PRE-WAR LEVELS THROUGH THE END OF 2003, WITH 
CONTINUING FUNDING INTO 2004 TO ALLOW FOR PROPER "HAND OVER"

SOUTH/CENTRAL IRAQ

¶9. (SBU) FAO OFFICE IN BAGHDAD WAS LOOTED AND MUST BE 
ENTIRELY REBUILT/REFURBISHED.  FAO HAS NOT HAD A PERMANENT 
PRESENCE IN OTHER AREAS OF THE CENTER/SOUTH. FAO'S PLAN IS 
TO HAVE APPROXIMATELY 20 INTERNATIONAL STAFF IN SITU BY 
SEPTEMBER. 
 
¶10. (SBU) REPORTEDLY, USD 500 MILLION IN WAREHOUSED 
AGRICULTURAL INPUTS WERE LOOTED, BUT FAO HAS NOT BEEN ABLE 
TO VERIFY THIS. 
 
¶11. (SBU) FAO HAS BEEN DISCUSSING WITH WFP A PLAN FOR A 
JOINT CROP/FOOD ASSESSMENT MISSION IN FIRST WEEK OF JUNE. 
THERE IS SOME QUESTION, HOWEVER, AS TO WHETHER ADEQUATE 
SECURITY WILL BE IN PLACE BY THEN.

2003 AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION OUTLOOK 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶12. (SBU) THE LATE SPRING/EARLY SUMMER 2003 CROPS FORECAST 
FOR IRAQ IS AS FOLLOWS: 850,000 - 1 MILLION METRIC TONS (MT) 
OF WHEAT; 600,000-700,000 MT BARLEY.  NOTE: BARLEY 
PRODUCTION TREND IS UPWARDS FOR THE NORTHERN REGION DUE TO 
INCREASING DEMAND FOR ANIMAL FEED, AND POOR PRICES FOR WHEAT 
(ALLEGEDLY DEPRESSED BY OFF DISTRIBUTIONS). FALL 2003 CROPS

FORECAST: 100,000 MT RICE; 80,000 MT CORN (ASSUMES SEEDED 
AREA SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR, AND IRRIGATION RESTORED). 
HARVESTING PROGRESS: SECURITY SITUATION IN THE SOUTH IS 
LIKELY TO DISRUPT USUAL PATTERN OF "RENTAL" COMBINES, WHO 
BEGIN TO WORK FIRST IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY AND 
GRADUALLY FOLLOW THE HARVEST NORTHWARD. 
 
¶13. (SBU) ON THE PRESSING ISSUE OF AERIAL SPRAYING OF DATE 
PALMS IN THE CENTER/SOUTH GOVERNORATES, THOMAS INFORMED THAT 
FAO IS COMMITTED TO "MAKE THIS HAPPEN," WITH THE CAVEAT THAT 
THE SPRAYING BE CONDUCTED AT THE RIGHT TIME, BE DONE 
PROPERLY, AND BE ACCOMPANIED WITH APPROPRIATE GROUND 
SURVEYS. 
 
¶14. (SBU) THOMAS SUGGESTED USG/FAO ESTABLISH SPECIFIC 
CONTACT POINTS TO MANAGE INFORMATION FLOW.  FAO IS PRESENTLY 
BESET BY INQUIRIES FROM MANY POINTS WITHIN THE USG AND WOULD 
BENEFIT FROM THE DESIGNATION OF A PRIME CONTACT. THOMAS 
APPRECIATED THE REFERENCE TO FAO IRAQ ACTIVITIES IN THE 
RECENT U/S FAS J.B.PENN/DAN AMSTUTZ PRESS CONFERENCE. HE 
BELIEVES FAO CAN WORK CLOSELY WITH MR. AMSTUTZ. 
 
¶15. (SBU) THOMAS FORESEES A ONE YEAR "EXIT STRATEGY" FOR THE 
HANDOVER OF FAO'S ROGRAM TO NEW GOVERNMENT/PRIVATE SECTOR 
AND RETUR TO THE USUAL FAO ROLE OF PROVIDING TECHNICAL 
ASISTANCE. NOTE: FAO HAS JUST HIRED A VERY KNOWLEDGEBLE EX- 
FAO REP IN IRAQ, AMIR KAHLIL (SUDANESE),WHO WILL NOW SERVE 
AS AN ADVISER BASED IN NEW YOK CITY. FAO IS ALSO ATTENDING 
THIS WEEK IN NEW YOK A UN DEVELOPMENT GROUP (UNDG) MEETING 
ON IRAQ,WITH DAUD KHAN OF THE ORGANIZATION'S INVESTMENT 
CENTER REPRESENTING FAO. END NOTE.

THOMAS' VISIT TO WASHINGTON, PREFERABLY WHEN THE APPROPRIATE 
PEOPLE ARE IN TOWN, AND SHORTLY AFTER THE OFFICIAL FAO 
RELEASE OF ITS AG PLANS FOR THE NORTH.  WE HAVE COUNSELED 
FAO THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO HOLD OFF ON THE HIGHER-LEVEL 
CARSALADE VISIT FOR THE TIME BEING - SUGGESTING THAT A 
TECHNICAL-LEVEL CONSULTATION AT THIS JUNCTURE IS PREFERABLE.
