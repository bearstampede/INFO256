TAGS: IZ IT PREL IRAQI FREEDOM
SUBJECT: TAREQ AZIZ TO MEET THE POPE AND ITALIAN OFFICIALS 
FEB. 14 
 
REF: VATICAN 483 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR THOMAS COUNTRYMAN FOR REASO 
NS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 

¶1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 3. 
 
¶2. (C) CESARE RAGAGLINI, FM FRATTINI'S CHIEF OF STAFF, 
INFORMED POL MC THAT TAREQ AZIZ IS SCHEDULED TO VISIT THE 
VATICAN AND CALL ON THE POPE FEB. 14 (REF.)  THE IRAQI 
INTEREST SECTION IN ROME HAD ALREADY CALLED THE MFA SEEKING 
OFFICIAL GOI APPOINTMENTS, SAID RAGAGLINI, AND THE GOI'S 
INITIAL THOUGHT WAS TO HAVE AZIZ MEET WITH FM FRATTINI IN 
ORDER TO SEND THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE MESSAGE ON IRAQ TO AZIZ 
IN PERSON AND SUBSEQUENTLY IN A COMMUNIQUE.  RAGAGLINI ALSO 
MENTIONED THAT AZIZ WOULD CERTAINLY SEEK TO MEET OPPOSITION 
LEADERS WHO ARE AGAINST THE WAR AS WELL AS SOME CATHOLIC 
POLITICIANS WITHIN THE GOVERNING COALITION WITH WHOM HE HAS 
HAD LONG CONTACTS. 
 
¶3. (C) POL MC SAID THAT THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE MESSAGE TO 
IRAQ WOULD BE FOR THE MFA TO REFUSE TO SEE AZIZ ALTOGETHER 
BUT UNDERSTOOD THAT WAS DIFFICULT SINCE ITALIAN PUBLIC 
OPINION WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE REFUSAL OF THE GOI TO TALK 
TO AZIZ.  POL MC PROMISED TO CHECK IF THE DEPARTMENT HAD ANY 
MESSAGE FOR THE GOI TO COMMUNICATE TO AZIZ, BUT SAID THAT THE 
DEPARTMENT WOULD PROBABLY NOT OFFER AN OPINION ON WHO IN THE 
GOI OUGHT TO MEET AZIZ.
