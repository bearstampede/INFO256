SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. THE U.S. MISSION IN ROME DRAWS YOUR ATTENTION TO THE UN 
WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME (WFP) APPEAL FOR DONOR SUPPORT TO WFP'S 
NEW EMERGENCY OPERATION (EMOP) FOR THE PALESTINIAN 
TERRITORIES COVERING THE PERIOD FROM JULY 15, 2003 THROUGH 
JULY 14, 2004.  THE FOOD AID APPEAL IS VALUED AT U.S. 
DOLLARS 31 MILLION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. WFP'S EMOP 10190.00, VALUED AT U.S. DOLLARS (USD) 31 
MILLION AND INVOLVING THE PROVISIONING OF ABOUT 71,000 TONS 
OF FOOD COMMODITIES, PROVIDES TARGETED RELIEF AID TO 530,000 
FOOD-INSECURE PEOPLE IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES. 
 
¶3. NUTRITIONAL SURVEYS INDICATE MALNUTRITION IN SOME PARTS 
OF GAZA AND THE WEST BANK.  AS PER THE UN, ANEMIA LEVELS 
HAVE RISEN TO 50 PERCENT IN CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIX 
AND FIFTY-NINE MONTHS, AND MICRONUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES ARE UP 
BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED INTAKE OF FRESH FRUITS AND 
VEGETABLES. 
 
¶4. THE EMOP WILL ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF POPULATIONS 
TARGETED ON THE BASIS OF VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS AND MAPPING 
FIELDWORK AND THE JOINT FAO/WFP CROP AND FOOD SUPPLY 
    ASSESSMENT MISSION CONDUCTED IN APRIL AND MAY 2003. 
 
¶5. WFP ASSISTANCE AIMS TO COMPLEMENT AND SUPPLEMENT THE 
EFFORTS OF THE PALESTINIAN MINISTRY OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS IN THE 
PROVISION OF FOOD ASSISTANCE.  SPECIAL GROUPS, PARTICULARLY 
THOSE AFFECTED BY CLOSURES AND RESTRICTED MOVEMENT, SUCH AS 
BEDOUINS WHO RELY SOLELY ON LIVESTOCK AND FISHERMEN IN GAZA, 
WILL BE SUPPORTED WITH FOOD RATIONS AND TARGETED FOOD FOR 
WORK AND FOOD FOR TRAINING INTERVENTIONS. 
 
¶6. THE PROJECT DOCUMENT FOR THIS APPEAL IS FOUND ON THE WFP 
WEBSITE.  BERTON
