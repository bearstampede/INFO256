Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
---------------- 
General Overview 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) COM convened Abu Dhabi's Iraq Task Force/Core 
Emergency Action Committee (EAC) at 1000 local time, 
Tuesday 4/1.  Embassy Abu Dhabi, FCS (located outside 
of the Embassy compound), and the USGS office in Al 
Ain remain open with full staffing. 
 
----------------------- 
UAEG Actions/Statements 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) POL reported that the UAE Cabinet issued a 
public statement on 3/31 calling for an end to the war 
in Iraq as soon as possible, UN participation in 
finding a peaceful resolution, and preservation of 
Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.  The 
Council of Ministers also expressed its concern for 
Iraqi citizens and continued support for Kuwait's 
security and stability. 
 
¶4.  (U) The wife of the Crown Prince of Ras Al-Khaimah 
publicly called for strong participation in an anti- 
war demonstration to be held in that northern emirate 
later today. 
 
-------- 
Security 
-------- 
 
¶5.  (C) RSO proposed general guidelines defining two 
limited movement modes for embassy personnel to be 
imposed in emergency situations: "move safe" and 
"stand fast".  Information defining the two security 
modes and providing guidelines for implementation will 
be distributed to embassy personnel by Administrative 
Notice.  CONS discussed warden message wording 
approved by CA to be used in connection with the 
implementation of each security mode. 
 
¶6.  (S/NF) RSO noted that on 3/31 the 24-hour 
uniformed policemen assigned to the AMB, DCM, ORCA 
Chief and PAO residences were replaced with CID plain 
clothes roving patrol.  RSO and ORCA will consult with 
their counterparts to discuss the possibility of 
uniformed walking patrols for neighborhoods where 
embassy staff reside.

¶7.  (U) On 4/1, the UAE Red Crescent Authority and

----------- 
Local Media

¶8.  (U) The local press and TV reported heavily on the 
4,000 volunteers traveling to Iraq to fight coalition 
forces and continue to highlight Iraqi civilian 
casualties.  PAO remarked on subtle positive shifts in 
press coverage reflecting continued military progress 
by coalition forces.  In addition to covering the 
current military action in Iraq, the press is also 
speculating heavily about governance in post-Saddam 
Iraq, including who will receive reconstruction 
contracts.

reconvene at 1000 local time, Wednesday 4/2.
