¶1. (U) This cable contains an action request.  See para 3. 
 
 
¶2. (C) MFA Deputy Under Secretary for Economic Affairs Alev 
Kilic and Director General For Energy Hakki Akil told Econ 
Couns May 15 that, as the MFA had told us previously 
(reftel), the lack of oil flow in the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik 
pipeline was having a corrosive affect on the pipe and the 
storage tanks at Ceyhan.  Econ Couns emphasized that the 
quickest way to get Iraqi oil flowing again was passage of 
the U.N. sanctions lift resolution, and again urged full 
Turkish support of that resolution.  Kilic and Akil responded 
that the corrosive affect was increasingly daily and this 
could not wait "two to three weeks." 
 
 
¶3. (C) Action request:  We cannot confirm that the corrosive 
impact is significant and increasingly daily, as the MFA 
claims.  Post would appreciate any guidance Department could 
provide to the MFA's inquiry on this issue, and on the 
technical aspects of the MFA's claim.
