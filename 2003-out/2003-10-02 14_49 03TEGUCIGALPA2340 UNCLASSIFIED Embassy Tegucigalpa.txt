SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON ROBERT ZOELLICK'S VISIT TO CENTRAL 
AMERICA, OCTOBER 1, 2003 
 
Â¶1. Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based liberal daily "La Tribuna" on 
10/1 entitled "Softening".  "This week, USTR Robert Zoellick is 
visiting Central America in an attempt to convince the regional 
governments of the need to make progress on CAFTA negotiations." 
 
"In addition, Zoellick will try to dissuade Guatemala and Costa 
Rica from taking part in the G-22, which includes other Latin 
American countries led by Brazil.  This group proposed the total 
elimination of agricultural subsidies during the latest WTO 
meeting in Cancun, an issue that has been a nuisance for 
Washington." 
 
"During his trip to the region, Zoellick will meet with the 
Central American presidents, the Ministers of Economy, 
Congressmen, CAFTA negotiators, businessmen and civil society 
representatives, trying to soften the position of these sectors 
by stressing the benefits Central America will obtain through a 
free trade agreement with the U.S."
