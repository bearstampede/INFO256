¶2.  BEGIN TEXT OF GOC STATEMENT: 
 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA ASSESSES THE FALL 
OF SADDAM HUSSEIN'S DICTATORSHIP REGIME AS A GOOD CHANCE 
FOR THE FUTURE OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE, AS WELL AS FOR THE 
ADVANCEMENT OF PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE WIDER REGION. 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA HOPES THAT 
MILITARY OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE SUFFERING OF IRAQI 
CITIZENS, ALLIANCE SOLDIERS, JOURNALISTS, AND OTHER 
VICTIMS, WILL SOON BE OVER. 
 
IN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES IN IRAQ, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 
PUBLIC PEACE AND ORDER, THE TRUE PROTECTION OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS, AND THE DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IN 
WHICH THE UN SHOULD HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE, IS OF CRUCIAL 
IMPORTANCE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA 
EXPECTS IRAQ TO BE CONSTITUTED AS A SOVEREIGN COUNTRY WITH 
THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH WILL ENABLE A PEACEFUL AND DIGNIFIED 
LIFE TO ALL ITS CITIZENS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA PASSED A DECISION 
ON APRIL 3, 2002 ON SENDING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO 
IRAQ'S WAR-AFFECTED POPULATION IN THE AMOUNT OF 20 MILLION 
KUNA, AND ARRANGEMENTS ABOUT ITS SPEEDY DELIVERY AND 
    DISTRIBUTION ARE CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED. THE GOVERNMENT 
REITERATES THE WILLINGNESS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA TO 
PARTICIPATE IN REMOVING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR AND IN 
THE ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ.
