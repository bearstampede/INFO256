¶1. (C) Further to Reftel, Poloff February 7 discussed the 
lack of attorney/family access to jailed PKK/KADEK leader 
Abdullah Ocalan with Kaan Esener, head of the MFA's 
Department of Council of Europe Affairs.  Esener claimed that 
a series of mechanical failures and high seas have grounded 
the ferry that shuttles visitors every Wednesday to Imrali 
Island in the Sea of Marmara, where Ocalan is the only 
prisoner.  Ocalan last received visitors November 27.  "None 
of Ocalan's attorneys or relatives" had been denied 
permission to visit.  MFA is concerned about Ocalan's 
isolation, and the strong reaction it has evoked in the 
southeast.  MFA officials have contacted their counterparts 
in the Justice and Interior ministries and urged them to find 
a way to arrange a visit as soon as possible. 
 
 
¶2. (C) In response to a question, Esener said he is aware of 
rumors that Ocalan is dead, but said Justice Ministry 
officials have assured MFA that Ocalan is in good health.
