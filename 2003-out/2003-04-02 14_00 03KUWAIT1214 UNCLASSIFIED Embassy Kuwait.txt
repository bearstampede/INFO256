REF: A. KUWAIT 673 
     ¶B. 02 KUWAIT 5543 
 
¶1. During its April 1, 2003 session, Kuwait's National 
Assembly ratified and referred to the Council of Ministers a 
draft unified customs law for Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) 
states.  Kuwait remains the lone member of the six-nation GCC 
yet to formally agree on the legal side of the GCC Customs 
Union, which was officially launched January 1, 2003 (ref A). 
  Kuwait's Amir agreed to the law in principle last year, 
enabling Kuwait to join the Customs Union (ref B).  The draft 
law was scheduled to be passed nearly a year ago, but stalled 
in the National Assembly waiting approval. Under the new law, 
all goods entering Kuwait will be subject to a 5 percent 
customs tax, which is the same percentage in each of the 
other GCC member states. 
 
¶2. Kuwait's Constitution stipulates that the Amir has 30 days 
to sign the draft into law.  From the National Assembly, the 
proposal will be forwarded to the Council of Ministers, who 
will then prepare a decree, which, under Article 65 of 
Kuwait's Constitution, the Amir must sign into law within 30 
days submission from the National Assembly.
