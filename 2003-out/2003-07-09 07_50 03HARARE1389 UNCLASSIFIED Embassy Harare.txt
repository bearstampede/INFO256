SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION PRESIDENT BUSH'S VISIT TO AFRICA; 
HARARE 
 
  ¶1.   Under headline "Bush must demand that Mbeki act on 
      Zimbabwe" the independent daily "The Daily News" 
      dedicated its July 9 editorial to calling on 
      President George W. Bush  "to use his immense 
      influence to pressure" South African President Thabo 
      Mbeki to stand up for democracy and good governance 
      by acting on Zimbabwe.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .The economic aid and development support that 
      Bush is dangling before the continent pales into 
      insignificance when compared with the damage caused 
      to Africa's weak economies by the United States' 
      protectionist trade policies.  But we totally agree 
      with Bush on one count, and that is that regional 
      powerhouse South Africa must abandon its ineffective 
      policy of so-called `quiet diplomacy' and lead the 
      way in pressuring President Robert Mugabe and his 
      ruling ZANU PF party to abandon ruinous policies 
      that have brought this once prosperous country to 
      its knees.  Bush must not be swayed or blackmailed 
      by the usual cheap accusations of racism or arrogant 
      imperialism by South African President Thabo Mbeki 
      and others. . .who. . .are only interested in buying 
      more time for Mugabe and his administration.  The U. 
      ¶S. leader must take comfort in the knowledge that 
      the majority of ordinary Zimbabweans. . .support his 
      call that Zimbabwe return to democracy.  We urge 
      Bush to use his immense influence to pressure Mbeki 
      to stop covering up for Mugabe.  Bush must tell 
      Mbeki what all of us have tried to tell the South 
      African leader but in vain.  That is that Mbeki 
      should vigorously lead the Southern African 
      Development Community and the rest of the 
      international community in demanding that Mugabe 
      step down to pave the way for a transitional 
      government that will be tasked with organizing fresh 
      and truly democratic elections in Zimbabwe.  Bush 
      has already started his African safari on a high 
      note by forcing Charles Taylor to leave power and 
      give Liberia a chance to start all over again.  We 
      see absolutely no reason why he should fail to 
      emulate Henry Kissinger's diplomatic triumph in 
      Pretoria in 1976, when he got John Vorster. . .to 
      turn the screws on Ian Smith. . .until the white 
      supremacist agreed to black majority rule. . . ."
