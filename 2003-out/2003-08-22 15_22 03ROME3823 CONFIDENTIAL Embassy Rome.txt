    ¶1. (C) SUMMARY: ITALY SUPPORTS USG VIEWS ON ESDP AND BERLIN 
PLUS.  ITALIAN OFFICIALS CONFIRM THAT THEY HAVE CALLED THE 
AUGUST 29 ESDP EXPERTS LEVEL MEETING TO PRE-EMPT A RUMORED 
"GANG OF FOUR" MEETING IN EARLY SEPTEMBER AND TO FOCUS ON THE 
"POSITIVE ASPECTS" OF THE APRIL 29 SUMMIT DECLARATION.  THEY 
SEE  "NO CHANCE" THAT A SEPARATE EU PLANNING CELL AT TERVUREN 
WOULD RECEIVE BROAD ENOUGH SUPPORT TO BE CONSIDERED SERIOUSLY 
AT 15 (25).  ITALY'S VIEW IS THAT ANY STRUCTURED EU SECURITY 
COOPERATION WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY ALL EU MEMBERS.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (C) ON AUGUST 19, MFA ACTING POLITICAL DIRECTOR CLAUDIO 
BISOGNERO TOLD A/POL MINISTER COUNSELOR AND POLOFF THAT ITALY 
SUPPORTS USG VIEWS ON ESDP AND BERLIN PLUS AS DESCRIBED IN 
REF A, AND THAT THE EU PRESIDENCY'S GOAL IS TO BRING THE 
DEBATE ON EUROPEAN SECURITY BACK TO 15 (25), AND TO SAFEGUARD 
BERLIN PLUS.  BISOGNERO PROMISED TO PASS OUR POINTS TO MFA 
EUROPEAN CORRESPONDENT AND ESDP COORDINATOR SANDRO 
DEBERNADIN.  ALSO AT THE MEETING WAS ACTING NATO OFFICE 
DIRECTOR CARLO LO CASCIO, WHO MENTIONED THAT THE ITALIAN 
MISSION TO NATO HAD TOLD HIM EARLIER THAT DAY THAT THERE 
WOULD BE A "GANG OF FOUR" MEETING ON SEPTEMBER 9 OR 10 (REF 
B). 
 
¶3. (C) IN A FOLLOW UP MEETING ON AUGUST 21, DEBERNADIN 
CONFIRMED TO POLOFF THAT THE GOAL OF THE ITALIAN EU 
PRESIDENCY IS TO STRENGTHEN ESDP AND EUROPEAN SECURITY 
CAPABILITIES IN GENERAL, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME REAFFIRMING 
BERLIN PLUS AS THE GUIDELINE FOR NATO-EU SECURITY RELATIONS 
AND EU MILITARY OPERATIONS.  ITALY HAD CALLED THE AUGUST 29 
ESDP EXPERTS LEVEL MEETING OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL BRUSSELS 
    FRAMEWORK NOT AS A TRIBUNAL TO JUDGE THE FOUR NOR AS A 
CONCESSION TO THEIR DEMANDS BUT TO FOCUS ON THE "POSITIVE 
ASPECTS" OF THE APRIL 29 SUMMIT DECLARATION.  THERE "IS NO 
CHANCE" THAT A SEPARATE EU PLANNING CELL AT TERVUREN WILL 
RECEIVE BROAD ENOUGH SUPPORT TO BE CONSIDERED SERIOUSLY, SAID 
DEBERNADIN, AND ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE AUGUST 29 MEETING 
WILL BE TO FIND A FACE-SAVING WAY OF ALLOWING THE FOUR TO 
BACK OUT OF THAT PROPOSAL.  HE SAID THAT ITALY WILL TRY TO 
PERSUADE THE FOUR THAT A SEPARATE PLANNING CELL IS NOT 
NECESSARY BY CITING THE FACT THAT THE ARTEMEIS OPERATION 
DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT ONE.  DEBERNADIN HAS NO FURTHER 
INFORMATION ON THE RUMOR OF ANOTHER MEETING OF THE FOUR ON 
SEPTEMBER 9 OR 10, OTHER THAN THAT HE UNDERSTANDS IT WOULD BE 
AT THE "TECHNICAL LEVEL."  HE IS HOPEFUL THAT THE AUGUST 29 
MEETING WOULD PRECLUDE THE PERCEIVED NEED FOR THE FOUR TO 
CONVENE SEPARATELY. 
 
¶4. (C)  AN EU PLANNING CELL WITHIN SHAPE AND THE "STRUCTURED 
COOPERATION" ISSUE WILL BE ON THE AGENDA AUGUST 29. 
DEBERNADIN SAID HE IS IN THE PROCESS OF DISCUSSING BOTH WITH 
"LIKE-MINDED EU PARTNERS."   ITALY'S VIEW IS THAT ANY 
COOPERATION WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY ALL EU MEMBERS, EVEN 
IF NOT ALL MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN SPECIFIC INITIATIVES (MUCH 
LIKE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EURO).  HE TOOK NOTE OF OUR 
 
ROME 00003823  002 OF 002 
 
 CELL WITHIN SHAPE SHOULD 
REINFORCE D/SACEUR'S ROLE BY ENSURING THAT IT FALL UNDER HIS 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
 
¶5. (C)  DEBERNADIN SAID THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT JAVIER 
SOLANA'S DRAFT EUROPEAN SECURITY STRATEGY PAPER WILL BE 
DISCUSSED AT THE ROME MEETING.  THE PAPER IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY 
DEVELOPED FOR DETAILED DISCUSSION.  THE NEXT STEP FOR THE ESS 
WILL BE AN AGREEMENT ON "METHODOLOGY" AT THE SEPTEMBER 6 RIVA 
DEL GARDA GYMNICH, FOLLOWED BY THREE "BRAINSTORMING" SEMINARS 
CONSISTING OF ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH OF THE 25 
MEMBER/FUTURE EU STATES, AS WELL AS INVITED NON-GOVERNMENT 
"SECURITY EXPERTS" FROM ACADEMIA AND THINK TANKS THROUGHOUT 
EUROPE.  THE FIRST OF THESE SEMINARS WILL BE SPONSORED BY THE 
ASPEN INSTITUTE IN ROME ON SEPTEMBER 17. 
 
¶6. (C) COMMENT:  DEBERNADIN WILL REPRESENT THE ITALIAN 
PRESIDENCY AT THE AUGUST 29 MEETING, ACCOMPANIED BY MOD VICE 
CHIEF OF DEFENSE (CHOD) MAJOR GENERAL VINCENCO CAMPORINI. 
CAMPORINI'S EMBASSY CONTACTS CONSIDER HIM TO BE AN EXCELLENT 
CHOICE, WHO WILL GUARD CAREFULLY AGAINST ANY ATTEMPT BY ANY 
EU MEMBER STATE TO ERODE NATO'S PRIMACY AS GUARANTOR OF 
TRANSATLANTIC SECURITY, OR TO WATER DOWN BERLIN PLUS.
