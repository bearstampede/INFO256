SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON AVIATION THREAT -- DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
 
REF: STATE 258046 
 
¶1.  EcoPol chief and Econoff delivered subject demarche on 
September 9 to Director General of Civil Aviation Carlos 
Alvarez, who undertook to convoke directors of airports in 
the Dominican Republic.  Alvarez suggested further points of 
contact, which Embassy is pursuing. 
 
¶2.  Embassy has prepared letter requesting closer cooperation 
on aviation security, warning of the catastrophic effect on 
tourism to the Caribbean of any terrorist hijacking which 
might occur in the area.  Letter includes specific request 
that all airport officials be instructed that airline 
personnel have the authority and legal obligation to refuse 
to carry undocumented or improperly documented persons. 
Letter cites specific cases from mid-August, in which 
intruders were necessarily aided by airport personnel and 
asks for investigation and prosecution of those abetting 
undocumented potential migrants.  Embassy is sending letter 
on September 16 to directors of all airports, immigration, 
customs, and airport security services.
