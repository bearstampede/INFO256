¶1. Post strongly supports the Department of Labor's proposed 
regional basic education project targeting child laborers 
and children at risk of working in Central America and 
welcomes the proposed visit of DOL officials/consultants 
(ref A). 
 
¶2. DOL is currently funding ILO/IPEC programs to combat 
child labor in the following sectors: coffee in Santa 
Barbara, melons in Choluteca, commercial sexual exploitation 
of children in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, and child 
divers in the Mosquitia.  (ILO/IPEC also has programs funded 
by other donors to help combat child labor in garbage dumps 
and domestic service in Tegucigalpa.)  In addition, 
USAID/Washington is funding a successful one-year pilot 
project in Valle to provide educational opportunities to 
working children, which ends in December 2003.  Post 
understands that further USAID/Washington funding for this 
project is unlikely. 
 
¶3. Post suggests that DOL consider (1) working with ILO/IPEC 
to expand its program in Choluteca to encompass the USAID 
project in neighboring Valle and add sugar cane farms and 
child victims of commercial sex exploitation in the area 
which borders both El Salvador and Nicaragua, or (2) expand 
work combating commercial sexual exploitation of children in 
Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula, and other large population 
centers which would augment the USG's support for increased 
GOH efforts against trafficking in persons (both domestic 
and international).  Post notes that while assisting 
children working in commercial agriculture (a sector key to 
CAFTA) is a high priority, most child laborers work in the 
informal sector.  Another option would be to begin a new 
program to assist children in the informal sector, many of 
whom might be street children or at risk to become street 
children.

labor in Honduras.  End Note.
