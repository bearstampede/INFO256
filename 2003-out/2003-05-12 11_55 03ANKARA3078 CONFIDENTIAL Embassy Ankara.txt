¶1. (C) MFA Deputy Director General for Middle East Affairs 
Safak Gokturk informed us May 12 that Turkey intends to send 
a three-person "specialized" team to northern Iraq (Mosul, 
Irbil and Kirkuk) to meet with KDP, PUK and Turkmen 
leadership.  The team is planning to fly from Ankara (via 
Turkish Airlines) to either Diyarbakir or Mardin (plans still 
being coordinated) and cross the Habur Gate (via ground 
transportation) into northern Iraq May 14 in the morning 
(Ankara time).  The MFA already has informed Ankara-based KDP 
and PUK reps, and asked if Barzani and Talabani would be 
available.  Gokturk said the team also intends to travel to 
Baghdad to meet with newly arrived TU embassy staff. 
¶2. (C) The team consists of: 
 
 
--AMB Selim Karaosmanoglu:  MFA Director General for the 
Balkans.  MFA's "political coordinator for Iraq."  Formerly 
Turkey's ambassador to Iraq before Mehmet Akat (who served 
before current Amb. Osman Paksut). 
 
 
--AMB Ecvet Tezcan:  MFA Director General for Intelligence 
and Research (INR).  Former TU Amb. in Baku and DDG for INR 
(when INR had the lead for northern Iraq issues). 
 
 
--Kerim Uras:  MFA Department Head for Iraq. 
 
 
¶3. (C) Gokturk asked us to convey this information to US 
military authorities in Iraq.  He promised to provide 
additional details (e.g. automobile license plates, 
personnel, equipment, etc.) as the MFA had done when Turkish 
Amb. Paksut's group crossed Habur Gate last week (reftel).
