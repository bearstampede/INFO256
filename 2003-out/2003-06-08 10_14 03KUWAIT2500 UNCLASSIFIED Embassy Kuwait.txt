SUBJECT:  KUWAIT'S NEW CABINET, PENDING ELECTIONS 
 
¶1. In order to run in the National Assembly elections 
scheduled for July 5, four members of the Cabinet have 
resigned, as required by the Constitution:  Talal al-Ayyar 
(Electricity and Water, Social Affairs and Labor), Fahd 
Dhaisan al-Mai al-Azmi (Public Works, Housing), Ahmed Baqer 
(Justice, Awqaf and Islamic Affairs), and Salah Khorsheed 
(Commerce and Industry). 
 
¶2.  The Constitution also requires the Cabinet to include at 
least one elected member of the National Assembly.  To meet 
this requirement, MP Rashed al-Hjailan, who is not running 
for reelection, has been appointed to the Cabinet.  All 
these changes took effect June 3.
