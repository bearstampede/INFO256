SUBJECT:  COLOMBO EAC MEETING APRIL 8, 2003 
 
REF:  (A) Colombo 548, (B) Colombo 582 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by S.V. Wright, Regional Security 
Officer, reason 1.5 (C) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On April 8, 2003 Colombo Emergency Action 
Committee (EAC) met to discuss the local security situation. 
The DCM chaired the EAC. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The EAC agreed that Colombo appears calm; the 
trend is of decreasing agitation.  There was a relatively 
minor protest on Friday April 4 that - given the police 
refusal to allow protests near the U.S. Embassy - 
concentrated on the Saudi and UAE Embassies.  About 300 
people protested the War and burned American flags. 
Although the road in front of the Chancery was briefly 
closed as a precaution, the demonstration ended peacefully. 
 
¶4.  (S) The RSO briefed the EAC on updated information 
relating to possible Iraqi surveillance in Colombo (see 
reftels).  Recent information obtained by PII and the Sri 
Lanka Police indicate the subject identified may be a 
bonafide Iraqi businessman.  Inquiries are continuing, 
however. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The EAC decided to disband the use of the LAV 
shuttle effective Friday April 11 unless the security 
situation degrades.  The current progress in the War and 
lack of an emotional reaction in Colombo led the EAC to 
slightly reduce our security posture. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The local police will remain deployed at all the 
residence for at least one more week. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The EAC decided to continue the travel 
restriction for the east of Sri Lanka.  It did, however, 
approve a USAID trip to the northern Jaffna peninsula. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) The committee agreed to meet again on Tuesday 
April 15.
