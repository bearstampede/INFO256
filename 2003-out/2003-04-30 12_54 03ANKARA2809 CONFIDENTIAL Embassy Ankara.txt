SUBJECT: TURKISH MFA RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON ARAFAT CONTACTS 
 
 
REF: STATE 106646 
 
 
(u) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch, reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
¶1. (C) In absence of higher-ranking MFA officials, we 
delivered reftel demarche to Acting Head of Department for 
Middle East and Maghreb Tuzun.  In response Tuzun said he is 
not aware of any current GOT plans to visit Arafat. 
 
 
¶2. (C) Noting Turkey's strong support for President Bush,s 
initiative, Tuzun underscored Turkey's good relations with 
both Palestinians and Israelis and readiness to contribute to 
a solution.  After citing a Turkish-translation of a 
&Ha,aretz8 article quoting Japanese Foreign Minister 
Yoriko Kawaguchi saying she will meet Arafat despite Israeli 
objections, Tuzun then shared his personal view regarding 
Turkish relations with the Palestinians and Israelis.  He 
stated that, since Arafat is the legally elected Palestinian 
chairman, it would not be proper not to visit him and it 
would be more useful to have direct talks with Arafat to 
express Turkish views.  It would not be useful to put 
restrictions on dealing with the Palestinians at the 
beginning of the peace process.  Tuzun re-emphasized these 
views are his own.  We asked him to ensure U.S. views were 
considered at more senior levels.
