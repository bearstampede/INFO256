E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6 FIVE YEARS AFTER CLOSURE OF ICTY 
TAGS: BK HR NL PHUM PREL SR ICTY
SUBJECT: ICTY: PRESIDENT MERON TO VISIT BELGRADE JULY 24-25 
 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by: Clifton M. Johnson, Legal Counselor, 
Reason: 1.5(d) and 1.6. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) International Criminal Tribunal for the former 
Yugoslavia (ICTY) President Theodor Meron has received and 
accepted a formal invitation to visit Belgrade from Serbia 
and Montenegro (SAM) Foreign Minister Svilanovic.  Meron,s 
visit is scheduled for July 24 to 25 and is being pitched by 
Svilanovic as a way to promote international justice and 
strengthen SAM,s cooperation with the ICTY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The visit will, apparently, be given a high profile 
with meetings promised with President Marovic, Prime Minister 
Zivkovic, and Foreign Minister Svilanovic.  Meetings are also 
being scheduled with key local judges.  Meron will be 
accompanied by his Chief of Staff, Larry Johnson, and Vice 
President Judge Pocar (Italy). 
 
¶4.  (C) Comment.  Meron can be expected to press SAM 
authorities vigorously on the need to enhance cooperation 
with the Tribunal and to arrest Mladic and other outstanding 
war criminals.  He is mindful of the need to make these 
points while acknowledging important progress by SAM, and 
views this visit as an opportunity to build a rapport with 
SAM interlocutors that will prove beneficial to both SAM and 
the ICTY.  He would welcome any additional background or 
suggested points to raise during his visit. We believe a 
meeting with Ambassador Montgomery and briefing from Embassy 
Belgrade would also be very helpful.  If Embassy Belgrade 
concurs, we would like to fix quickly the date/time for such 
a meeting on the front end of the visit to maximize its value 
and impact.  End comment.
