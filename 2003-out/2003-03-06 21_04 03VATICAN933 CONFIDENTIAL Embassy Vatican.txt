ENGAGEMENT HAS RECEIVED WIDESPREAD COVERAGE IN EUROPEAN AND 
OTHER INTERNATIONAL MEDIA, REFLECTING HIS ROLE AS A MORAL 
VOICE FOR HUMANITY SOUGHT OUT BY ALL SIDES IN THE CURRENT 
DEBATE.  THE HOLY SEE CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO VOICE 
BOTH ITS CONCERNS FOR THE POTENTIAL SUFFERING OF INNOCENT 
CIVILIANS FROM A RESORT TO MILITARY FORCE, AND ITS FEARS 
ABOUT AN INCREASE IN INTER-RELIGIOQUS STRIFE IN THE WEEKS 
AHEAD.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO URGE THEM NOT TO IGNORE THE 
CURRENT OPPRESSION UNDER SADDAM AND POTENTIAL SUFFERING 
SHOULD WMD GET INTO THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS.
