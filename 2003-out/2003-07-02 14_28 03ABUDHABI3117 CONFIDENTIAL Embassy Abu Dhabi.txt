SUBJECT: UAEG UP-TO-DATE ON PALESTINIAN AID COMMITMENT 
 
Ref: SECSTATE 181425 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (C) During a meeting on June 25, the Ambassador delivered 
Secretary Powell's oral message to MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan 
 
SIPDIS 
Bin Zayid, stressing the need for the UAEG to fulfil the 
commitment it made at the 2002 Beirut Summit to provide the 
Palestinian Authority budgetary support.  The Ambassador noted 
to Hamdan that our records reflect that the UAEG has thus far 
paid 60 percent of its commitment as of June 1.  Hamdan 
undertook to review the payment schedule of the UAEG's pledge 
and stated that his office would provide us with a report on its 
status. 
 
¶3.  (C) On July 2, Hamdan's Deputy Office Director Khadim Al 
Darei reported to Poloff that the UAEG has completely paid its 
Beirut 2002 $21 million pledge to the Palestinian Authority.  Al 
Dharei noted that the UAEG pledged an additional $21 million to 
the Palestinian Authority in Sharm Al Sheikh in March 2003, 
which the UAEG intends to pay in full by October 2003 as per the 
terms of the pledge. 
 
¶4.  (C) COMMENT:  We are confident that the UAEG will fulfill 
its assistance to the Palestinian Authority as promised.  These 
official pledges reflect only a portion of assistance provided 
to the Palestinian people.  We note that President Zayed and the 
UAE Red Crescent Authority have also made significant 
contributions to the Occupied Territories and likely will 
continue to do so in the future.  END COMMENT.
