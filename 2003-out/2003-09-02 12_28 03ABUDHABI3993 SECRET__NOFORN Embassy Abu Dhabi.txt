SUBJECT:  SCENESETTER FOR GENERAL BUCHANAN'S 
VISIT TO THE UAE 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Richard A. Albright, Charge 
d'Affaires, a.i., for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (S) General Buchanan:  On behalf of Ambassador 
Wahba, who is out of country until September 4, I 
would like to welcome you to the UAE.  Your visit 
comes at a time of unprecedented Emirati 
cooperation for Operation Enduring Freedom and of 
exemplary UAE support for Iraq's reconstruction. 
The Emiratis and the U.S. mission to the UAE are 
looking forward to your visit. 
 
¶3. (S) This will be your first opportunity to meet 
Major General Khaled Bin Adbullah al-Buainnan, 
Commander of the UAE AF/AD.  During your meeting 
with him, you may meet one, or both, of his Deputy 
Commanders, Brigadier Abdallah Said al-Hashmi and 
Brigadier Mohammed Sweidan al-Qamzi.  Post 
considered a meeting with UAE Armed Forces Chief of 
Staff LTG Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed al-Nahyan 
(MbZ), but the Emiratis preferred that General 
Khaled introduce you to MbZ at a subsequent 
meeting. 
 
¶4. (S) General Khaled last visited the U.S. in mid- 
May during which time he met with CSAF General 
Jumper, and discussed remote sensing and the E2C 
Hawkeye.  In September, General Khaled will be 
attending the Global Air Chiefs Conference in 
Washington, D.C. 
 
---------------- 
SUGGESTED THEMES 
---------------- 
 
¶5. (S) We propose that you touch on the following 
key bilateral military issues, in addition to the 
more general themes outlined below in para six: 
 
-- Provide a "look-ahead" on our likely CENTAF 
footprint both in the UAE specifically and the 
region more generally; 
 
-- Be prepared to engage with the Emiratis about 
their vision of the F-16 program as a first step in 
a strategic bilateral partnership with the U.S. 
 
-- Express our enthusiasm about the validation 
course at the Air Warfare Center, now tentatively 
scheduled for December 2003.  The Center will be a 
model for multilateral training in the region. 
 
-- Express our appreciation for the UAE offer to 
fund the "Al Dhafra Air Defense" site.  (Involves 
relocation of US housing facilities for Force 
Protection concerns.) 
 
-- Reiterate General Moseley's appreciation for 
General Khaled's assistance in facilitating the bed 
down of US aircraft at Al Dhafra Air Base during 
OIF. 
 
-- The Dubai Air Show takes place December 7-11, 
and will be preceded by a UAE-hosted Air Chiefs' 
Conference.  The UAE Government regards this as a 
major event and expects strong US support and 
presence.  You can anticipate a request to provide 
both a static display and demonstration aircraft 
for the Air Show, as well as topics and briefings 
for the Air Chiefs' Conference. 
 
¶6.  (S) More broadly, you may also wish to: 
 
-- Express thanks for the UAE's exemplary support 
for U.S. and coalition efforts in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, namely access to bases and logistical 
support, including air and sealift of Bulgarian 
troops to Iraq, the UAE SOC deployment at Bagram, 
as well as extensive intelligence coordination; 
 
-- Pass on our gratitude for the UAE's generous 
humanitarian assistance, especially the UAE Armed 
Force's establishment of the very successful Sheikh 
Zayed hospital in Baghdad and the UAE's efforts to 
re-supply with equipment and medicine other Iraqi 
hospitals and the provision of basic foodstuffs to 
the Iraqi people. 
 
------------------------- 
BILATERAL MILITARY ISSUES 
------------------------- 
Regional Footprint: 
------------------ 
 
¶7. (S) If appropriate, we recommend that you 
outline CENTAF's likely regional footprint.  The 
Emiratis have expressed openness for a more robust 
US presence in the region, including an alternate 
Air Force command center in the UAE. 
Air Warfare Center 
------------------ 
 
¶8. (S) The Gulf Air Warfare Center at Al-Dhafra Air 
Base is an important initiative.  The Center has 
tremendous potential to become a resource for 
multilateral training, defense cooperation, and 
compatibility.  There are two issues we wish to 
highlight.  First, the inaugural class is being 
delayed from October until December because of 
construction issues and UAE attempts to expand the 
scope of the original syllabus.  Second, Major 
General Khaled insists that the US Deputy 
Commandant should not out-rank the UAE Commandant 
(a Lieutenant Colonel). 
 
E2C Hawkeye - (If raised) 
------------------------- 
 
¶9. (S) The Emiratis are intent on purchasing the 
E2C Hawkeye.  The original LOA lapsed in June 
without their signature.  However, they issued a 
Letter of Intent saying they are still studying the 
Hawkeye, and deposited $5 million as a placeholder. 
The Emiratis are working with Northrop Grumman and 
the Naby to revise the LOA and they hope to have 
that done prior to the Dubai Air Show in December. 
 
Predator Update -- (If Raised) 
------------------------------ 
 
¶10. (S) The UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff raised 
his desire to procure the Predator B during his 
meetings in Washington in July.  He believes this 
system will provide him with the much-needed 
capability for surveillance of the UAE's porous 
coast and remote inland borders.  Be prepared to 
respond.
