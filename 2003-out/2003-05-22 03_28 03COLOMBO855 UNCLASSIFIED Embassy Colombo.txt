¶1.  Devastation from one of Sri Lanka's worst ever flood 
crises continues.  Nearly 250 people are feared dead and 
another 1000 are missing.  As many as 600,000 people are 
homeless as heavy rains continue in affected areas of five 
districts.  The government of Sri Lanka has appealed to the 
international community through the United Nations for 
assistance in providing relief.  Meanwhile, the brunt of the 
relief efforts are being carried out by the Sri Lankan 
military.  Navy boats and Air Force helicopters, and medical 
and rescue teams from all three services are working around 
the clock to provide emergency assistance.
