E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/20/2013 
TAGS: PTER PHUM PGOV PINR PINS CO
SUBJECT: TOP FARC COMMANDER KILLED BY COLOMBIAN ARMY 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR WILLIAM B. WOOD FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
 
¶1.  (S) SUMMARY: ON OCTOBER 19, THE COLOMBIAN ARMY KILLED 
EDGAR NAVARRO, ALIAS "MOCHO," DEPUTY COMMANDER OF THE FARC'S 
TEOFILO FORERO MOBILE COLUMN (TFMC), ONE OF THE FARC'S MOST 
ACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE UNITS.  THE OPERATION TO CAPTURE 
NAVARRO, WHICH ENDED WITH HIS DEATH, WAS BASED ON EFFECTIVE 
USE OF TECHNICAL AND HUMAN INTELLIGENCE.  NAVARRO'S DEATH IS 
A MAJOR SYMBOLIC AND TACTICAL VICTORY FOR THE GOC.  NAVARRO 
PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE FEBRUARY KIDNAPPING OF THREE U.S. 
CITIZEN CONTRACTORS AND MURDER OF A FOURTH, AND WAS WANTED BY 
GOC JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES ON NUMEROUS CHARGES OF KIDNAPPING, 
MURDER, AND TERRORISM.  HIS LOSS IS A MAJOR BLOW TO THE TFMC. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (S) FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS, THE COLOMBIAN ARMY'S 
ANTI-KIDNAPPING UNIT (GAULA) AND THE NATIONAL POLICE IN HUILA 
DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN COLLECTING TECHNICAL AND HUMAN 
INTELLIGENCE AGAINST THE FARC'S TFMC'S DEPUTY COMMANDER EDGAR 
NAVARRO, ALIAS "MOCHO."  ON OCTOBER 19, THE GAULA USED THIS 
ACCUMULATED INTELLIGENCE TO LAUNCH AN OPERATION TO CAPTURE 
AND ARREST HIM.  DURING THE OPERATION, NAVARRO'S SECURITY 
DETAIL OPENED FIRE, SPARKING A FIREFIGHT THAT KILLED NAVARRO 
AND TEN OF HIS MEN.  TWO CIVILIANS WERE INJURED IN THE 
CROSSFIRE. 
 
¶3. (S) NAVARRO'S DEATH IS A MAJOR SYMBOLIC AND TACTICAL 
VICTORY FOR THE GOC.  THE TFMC IS AMONG THE FARC'S MOST 
ACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE ELEMENTS, OPERATING AS THE ROUGH 
EQUIVALENT OF A SPECIAL FORCES UNIT.  NAVARRO HAS PLAYED A 
KEY ROLE IN NUMEROUS KIDNAPPINGS, MURDERS, AND TERRORIST 
ATTACKS, INCLUDING A MASS KIDNAPPING AT A LUXURY APARTMENT 
COMPLEX IN 2001, A COMMERCIAL AIRLINER HIJACKING, AND THE 
DETONATION OF A "HOUSE BOMB" IN FEBRUARY 2003 IN NEIVA, 
CAPITAL OF HUILA DEPARTMENT.  NAVARRO MAY HAVE PARTICIPATED 
IN THE FEBRUARY 2003 KIDNAPPING OF THREE U.S. CITIZEN 
CONTRACTORS AND THE MURDER OF A FOURTH, AND IS KNOWN TO HAVE 
BEEN IN CONTROL OF THE HOSTAGES FOR OVER A MONTH BETWEEN 
FEBRUARY AND MARCH.  AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH, NAVARRO WAS IN 
POSSESSION OF ONE OF THE HOSTAGE'S FIREARMS.  HIS DEATH IS A 
SERIOUS SETBACK FOR THE TFMC.  IT WILL HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME 
REPLACING NAVARRO, ESPECIALLY AS THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE 
ARRESTED SEVERAL OF HIS KEY ASSOCIATES. 
 
¶4. (S) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH NAVARRO WAS NOT A SENIOR FARC 
COMMANDER BY RANK, HIS INFLUENCE AND PROMINENT ROLE IN MAJOR 
TERRORIST OPERATIONS MADE HIM ONE OF THE HIGHEST VALUE 
TARGETS OF THE COLOMBIAN SECURITY FORCES.  THE OPERATION 
DEMONSTRATED EFFECTIVE USE OF ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE AND 
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND POLICE.
