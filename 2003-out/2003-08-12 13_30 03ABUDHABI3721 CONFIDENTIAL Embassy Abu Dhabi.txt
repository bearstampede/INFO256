SUBJECT:  UAE MAY CUT OIL PRODUCTION LATER THIS YEAR 
 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Charge d'Affaires, a.i., Richard A. 
Albright, for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C) The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) 
acknowledged publicly on August 10 that it will cut oil 
production in the last quarter of 2003 to undertake major 
repair work in the Lower Zakum and Umm Shaif offshore oil 
fields.  ADNOC analysts say that production from those two 
fields could be reduced by as much as 40 percent.  ADNOC 
will try to make up for the shortfall by increasing 
production of the higher grade Murban crude from other, 
unspecified fields.  A Western oil executive confirmed to 
Econoff that the scheduled maintenance includes renovations 
and upgrades that had been delayed earlier this year 
because of the war in Iraq.  ADNOC deferred work that could 
have affected the production of any one field, and stood 
ready to ramp up production to offset shortages caused by 
the loss in Iraqi exports. 
 
¶3.  (U) Current production from those two fields is 
estimated at about 420,000 barrels per day (bpd). The Abu 
Dhabi Marine Operating Company (ADMA-OPCO) quarterly 
bulletin states that current production in the Zakum field 
stands at 220,000 bpd and Umm Shaif produces about 200,000 
bpd.  Umm Shaif also has become a major gas producer for 
the UAE since the completion of the Umm Shaif Gas 
Development Project in 1994. 
 
¶4.  (C) Comment: Both the Zakum and Umm Shaif fields play a 
major role in the UAE's total oil production and oil 
exports -- Zakum alone has 321 oil and gas wells.  Although 
the Western oil exec said that Japan and India are the two 
major oil importers of the lower grade Zakum and Umm Shaif 
crude, the announcement nonetheless will put upward 
pressure on oil prices worldwide.  The news comes during a 
week when oil prices have spiked to their highest levels 
since before the onset of hostilities in Iraq.  End 
comment.
