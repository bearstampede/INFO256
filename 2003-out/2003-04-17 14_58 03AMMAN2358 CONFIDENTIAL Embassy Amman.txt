SUBJECT: TFIZ01: SEVERAL MISSIONS REQUEST U.S. HELP TO 
PROTECT OR REESTABLISH THEIR DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN BAGHDAD 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  The Polish Charge called the Ambassador April 17 to 
present a formal request from the Polish government for U.S. 
assistance in reestablishing its diplomatic presence in 
Baghdad.  On April 16 we also received a formal diplomatic 
note from the Romanian Embassy in Amman requesting that 
Coalition forces protect the Romanian Embassy in Baghdad 
which, according to the note, was looted on April 10.  The 
Japanese Charge to Iraq also told us April 17 that the 
Japanese Embassy in Baghdad has been looted within the past 
week. 
 
¶2.  (C)  In the past two days we have received numerous 
similar inquiries from other diplomatic missions in Amman. 
The Thais, Nigerians, Japanese, Belgians, Romanians, and 
Poles have all asked us to help protect their facilities in 
Baghdad, and provide them with information on the safety of 
Baghdad and the road from Amman to Baghdad so they can 
determine the proper time to send their diplomatic personnel 
back to Baghdad. 
 
¶3.  (C)  COMMENT:  Since most missions in Baghdad supported 
their Iraq operations from Amman, we anticipate a steady 
stream of queries from other embassies about when it will be 
safe for their people to travel to Baghdad to open or reopen 
missions there.  We also anticipate further requests for 
Coalition forces to protect diplomatic facilities in Baghdad. 
 We would appreciate any information the Department can 
provide so we can respond to these queries.
