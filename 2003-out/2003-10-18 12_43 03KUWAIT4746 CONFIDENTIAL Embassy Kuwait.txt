Â¶1.  (C) MFA Deputy Director of International Organization 
Affairs Amb. Aqeel Behbehani told Pol Chief October 18 that 
Kuwait would vote for the Costa Rican UNGA resolution calling 
for a total ban on all human cloning, and would urge other 
Arab states to do likewise.  When pressed, he said Kuwait 
would not co-sponsor.  He gave no explanation for that 
decision, other than to claim that the GOK's support would be 
just as helpful as co-sponsorship.
