SUBJECT: UAE OIL MINISTER SAYS OPEC QUOTAS WILL REMAIN 
UNCHANGED 
 
¶1.  (U) UAE PETROLEUM MINISTER OBEID BIN SAIF AL-NASIRI TOLD 
LOCAL REPORTERS ON JULY 27 THAT HE EXPECTS OPEC'S PRODUCTION 
QUOTAS TO REMAIN UNCHANGED AT THE CARTEL'S JULY 31 MEETING 
IN VIENNA.  HE SAID THAT OPEC COULD NOT JUSTIFY A PRODUCTION 
INCREASE AT THIS TIME BECAUSE OIL PRICES ARE WITHIN A RANGE 
OF $22 TO $28 PER BARREL. 
 
¶2.  (U) AL-NASIRI CONFIRMED THAT THE UAE CONTINUES TO 
PRODUCE AT ITS JUNE 1 QUOTA OF 2.2 MILLION BARRELS/DAY.  HE 
ALSO SAID THAT HE BELIEVES WORLD DEMAND FOR OIL WILL 
INCREASE FROM ABOUT 1 MILLION TO 1.5 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY 
DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003.  "OPEC WILL BE READY TO 
MEET ANY INCREASE IN DEMAND," SAID AL-NASIRI, AND WILL 
REVIEW PRODUCTION LEVELS AGAIN AT ITS REGULAR MEETING IN 
SEPTEMBER. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) AL-NASIRI'S TECHNICAL CONSULTANT DR. IBRAHIM 
ISMAEL PRIVATELY TOLD ECONOFF ON JULY 28 HE DID NOT EXPECT 
MUCH DEBATE AT THE JULY 31 MEETING.  THE CARTEL WAS SEEKING 
TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO -- LOWER OVERALL OPEC PRODUCTION 
IN JUNE AND CONTINUED DELAYS IN THE RESUMPTION OF IRAQI OIL 
EXPORTS HAD PUSHED OIL PRICES TO THE UPPER END OF THE OPEC 
PRICE RANGE.
