Jirga, earmarked for election of district reps, and public

¶3.    (C) Other News and an Info Request 
 
-- German Special Rep for Afghanistan Schmunck and EU Special 
Rep for Afghanistan Vendrell will be in the Hague on November 
10 for consultations with the GONL. 
-- On the question of an Afghan-led pledging conference for 
late winter, the Netherlands is unenthusiastic and believes 
the EU will share their view.  The Dutch feel there is little 
utility in holding a pledging conference before the Afghan 
budget is available, which could be March 2004.  In addition, 
the Dutch caution that EU member states will not have money 
approved or available by the proposed date. 
--  Ms. Van Zomeren and Special Rep Mollinger traveled to 
Afghanistan in October, visiting Kabul and the PRT at Konduz 
(Note:  the Germans have asked the Dutch to participate in 
the German-led Konduz PRT). 
--  Development Minister Van Ardenne recently added 
Afghanistan to the MFA's list of "partner countries", i.e., 
countries with which the Ministry has an official development 
relationship. 
-- The MFA requests USG position on Bonn II conference -- 
timing, process, etc.  Post would appreciate any recent 
talking points on Bonn II.
