SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  ROADMAP IRAQ 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  THE RECENT ATTACKS AGAINST U.S. SOLDIERS IN IRAQ 
AND THE ISRAELI CABINET'S RESERVATIONS ON THE ROADMAP DOMINATED 
COVERAGE IN UAE PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  AN "AL ITTIHAD" 
EDITORIAL COMMENTED ON THE SITUATION IN IRAQ AND RECOMMENDED 
MEANS TO ACHIEVE SECURITY AND STABILITY IN IRAQ.  A "GULF NEWS" 
ARTICLE BY UAE NATIONAL EDITOR-IN-CHIEF ABDUL HAMID AHMED 
CRITICIZED THE UNITED STATE'S HANDLING OF IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  COMMENTING ON RECENT ATTACKS AND DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST U.S. 
TROOPS IN IRAQ, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL ITTIHAD" 
EDITORIALIZED 5/28: 
 
"... IRAQ STILL REQUIRES A SERIOUS EFFORT TO ESTABLISH POLITICAL 
AND SOCIAL STABILITY AND PUBLIC SECURITY IN ORDER FOR 
RECONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES TO BEGIN.  THIS DEMANDS THE ESSENTIAL 
SOLIDARITY OF U.S., UK, ARAB, AND INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS IN 
ADDITION TO GIVING A VITAL AND EFFECTIVE ROLE TO IRAQI 
PEOPLE ..." 
 
¶3.  UNDER THE HEADLINE "PALESTINIAN CAUTION REQUESTED," SHARJAH- 
BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 5/27: 
 
"... THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY SHOULD BE VERY CAUTIOUS TOWARDS 
THE TEMPTATIONS THAT ARE SYMBOLIZED IN MEETINGS AND PRAISE 
WASHINGTON WANTS TO IMPOSE (ON THE PA), THAT IS BECAUSE THE 
DESTINY OF A WHOLE NATION IS AT STAKE, AND ANY NEGLIGENCE OF ITS 
RIGHTS TO ITS LAND, PALESTINE, WILL DRAG ON INFINITELY UNTIL THEY 
(PALESTINIAN RIGHTS) ARE ALL CROSSED OUT.  THIS IS WHAT SHARON 
SEEKS AND BUSH ASSISTS." 
 
¶4.  COMMENTING ON THE LIFTING OF SANCTIONS AND THE GENERAL 
SITUATION IN IRAQ, ABDUL HAMID AHMAD, UAE NATIONAL EDITOR-IN- 
CHIEF OF EXPATRIATE-ORIENTED ENGLISH DAILY "GULF NEWS" WROTE ON 
5/28: 
 
"... IT HAS BECOME EVIDENT THAT THE AMERICANS, BY BEING SO 
AMBIGUOUS AND BY PREVENTING THE IRAQIS FROM DECIDING THE FUTURE 
OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY, WANT CHAOS TO ROLE IRAQ... THE AMERICANS 
APPEAR TO BE RENEGING ON THEIR PROMISES TO LEAVE IRAQ AND HAND IT 
OVER TO THE IRAQIS ONCE THEIR MISSION IS OVER... " 
 
"... ACTUALLY WHAT THEY HAVE DONE SO FAR IS THAT THEY HAVE LOOKED 
AFTER THEIR OWN OCCUPATION FORCES IN IRAQ.  WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN 
ANY REAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY THE AMERICANS, WHETHER IN 
EDUCATION, HEALTH AND EVEN COMMUNICATION.  AS WE SEE IT, THE 
AIRPORT IN BAGHDAD IS STILL CLOSED ALTHOUGH IT SHOULD BE REOPENED 
SO THAT MORE AID WILL FLOW INTO THE COUNTRY... IT IS THEIR 
DELIBERATE POLICY TO EXCLUDE ALL IRAQI INTELLECTUALS AND EXPERTS 
IN MANY FIELDS INCLUDING POLITICS, ECONOMY, SCIENCE AND 
CULTURE ..." 
 
"... THE IRONY IS THAT A LITTLE-KNOWN U.S. EXPERT, NOAH FELDMAN, 
32, HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN TO HELP CHART IRAQ'S CONSTITUTION WHEN 
THE COUNTRY IS KNOWN TO POSSESS TOP LEGAL EXPERTS.  AND IRAQ IS 
CONSIDERED THE CRADLE OF THE FIRST MAN MADE LAWS IN HISTORY.  THE 
U.S. IS RUNNING IRAQ IN AN IGNORANT AND ARROGANT FASHION ... THE 
U.S. SUCCESS IN PUSHING A UN RESOLUTION TO LIFT THE SANCTIONS 
AGAINST IRAQ WAS INTERPRETED BY SOME AS A MOVE TO LEGALIZE THE 
OCCUPATION OF IRAQ.  BUT IT ALSO REMOVES ALL AMERICAN EXCUSES 
ABOUT LACK OF FUNDS TO REBUILD THE COUNTRY... "
