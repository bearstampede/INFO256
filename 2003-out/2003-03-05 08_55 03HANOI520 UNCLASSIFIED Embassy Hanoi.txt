field trip in Cambodia and use May 2 for a travel day. 
Proposed agenda in para 4.  ASEAN welcomed the working lunch 
with business representatives at the 16th US-ASEAN Dialogue

inviting ASEAN participants.  DDG An added that "the more, 
the merrier" in terms of the business participants at the 
lunch.
