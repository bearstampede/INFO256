¶1. This is an action request ) see para 3. 
 
¶2. (C) Poloffs delivered demarche (ref A) and non-paper 
August 26 to Ambassadors Francia Sencion and Roger Espaillat, 
Office Director and Sub-Director of the Americas Desk at the 
Foreign Ministry.  Sencion said that relevant Foreign 
Ministry offices are reviewing the non-paper and that she 
would give the Embassy a response, if any, in a follow-up 
meeting next week.  At first glance, neither Foreign Ministry 
official saw any potential problems (as with our previous 
UNGA demarche, ref B).  Post has not yet received the list of 
Dominican UNGA delegates (requested per ref C) and the 
Foreign Ministry Director of International Organizations has 
not been named.  A lot of decision-making has been put on 
hold until Foreign Minister Guerrero Prats returns from 
travel.  However, Sencion said that she would send the list 
of Dominican delegates within a few days. 
 
¶3. (C) Action Request: Ambassador Sencion inquired about the 
U.S. UNGA delegation.  Post requests a list of U.S. 
delegates, if available and appropriate, to share with the 
Foreign Ministry.
