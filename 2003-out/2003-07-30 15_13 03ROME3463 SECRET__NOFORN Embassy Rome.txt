¶1. (U) THIS IS AN URGENT ACTION REQUEST.  See para 6. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Italian officials are supportive of US assistance 
for stabilization efforts in Liberia.  As reported ref A, 
A/Pol Minister-Counselor met on July 24 with DG for Africa 
Cabras to secure Italy's lead in requesting EU funding for 
assistance to Liberia.  Officials in the MFA, MOD, and the 
PM's office have tracked with great interest the USG's July 
26 public announcement that the USG was activating a Joint 
Task Force (JTF) headquarters -- at a Southern European Task 
Force (SETAF) site near Vicenza, Italy -- to support an 
ECOWAS mission in Liberia.  These officials and senior 
Italian uniformed officers have expressed keen interest in 
further details about JTF activities. 
 
¶3. (S/NOFORN) We understand from discussions with US military 
personnel that the JTF HQ in Italy will have a maximum of 
about 400 US military personnel.  Additionally, a small, 
forward-deployed JTF cell will be established on a US 
military vessel off of Liberia's coast.  That cell would be 
comprised of 50-60 armed US military personnel who would flow 
from Italy via western Africa to the vessel.  We also 
understand that both the JTF HQ and the forward-deployed JTF 
cell are for support purposes only; neither would provide 
command and control for the ECOWAS mission. 
 
¶4. (S/NOFORN)  Late-breaking information indicates that a 
handful of US military personnel could begin to flow out of 
Italy to staff the forward-deployed cell as early as this 
evening (July 30).  The group would reportedly transfer (with 
personal arms) by bus from Vicenza to Aviano AFB, and then 
fly MILAIR to western Africa (NFI). 
 
¶5. (S/NOFORN) COMMENT.  As noted, the GOI is supportive of US 
efforts to stabilize Liberia.  While movements of armed US 
troops from Italy into areas of conflict are always 
potentially sensitive, this should be a relatively easy case, 
if/if managed properly.  GOI receptivity, already high 
because of the humanitarian nature of the mission, will be 
augmented by the fact that the US deployment from Italy is 
small, indirect (via a third country), and to a US vessel. 
Reported efforts to garner UNSC backing for the ECOWAS 
mission will also bolster GOI support.  Indeed, the only 
potential negative we foresee at this point is surprising our 
friends in the GOI.  Any perception that we failed to 
coordinate US military movements from Italy toward a zone of 
conflict could be used by the Berlusconi government's enemies 
to attack and weaken those most supportive of us.  Timely 
consultations will remove that potential problem.  END 
COMMENT. 
 
¶6. (S/NOFORN) ACTION REQUEST.  Post requests Department 
authorization soonest to approach appropriate GOI officials 
to provide details on the JTF and plans for the 
forward-deployed cell.  Instructions along the lines of the 
following should suffice: 
 
--  As you know, the USG is preparing support for an ECOWAS 
mission to stabilize Liberia. 
 
-- Central to this effort was the recent creation of a Joint 
Task Force HQ at Lungari, near Vicenza. 
 
-- We also plan to set up a small, forward-deployed JTF cell 
in the region.  Plans call for the cell to operate initially 
from a US military vessel off the coast of Liberia. 
 
-- In support of that cell, we foresee moving 50-60 US 
military personnel from Italy by MILAIR, via a third 
country(s). 
 
--  The situation in Liberia is dynamic and fluid.  Should 
events on the ground require a substantial change in our 
plans as they relate to US forces in Italy, we will inform 
you at the earliest opportunity. 
 
END ACTION REQUEST.
