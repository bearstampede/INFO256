REF: STATE 259322 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POL MINISTER COUNSELOR TOM COUNTRYMAN.  REASON: 1.5 (B)( 
D) 

¶1. (C) ON SEPTEMBER 16, MFA NIS DESK OFFICER LORENZO ORTONA 
CONFIRMED TO POLOFF THAT THE DRAFT US-EU STATEMENT ON BELARUS 
WE PROVIDED TO THE PRESIDENCY WAS DISCUSSED AT THE SEPTEMBER 
12 PSC IN BRUSSELS.  ORTONA SAID THAT WHILE ITALY AND THE 
OTHER MEMBER STATES AGREED WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE DRAFT, 
THEY DID NOT CONCUR ON US PROPOSED TIMING FOR RELEASING THE 
STATEMENT. 
 
¶2. (C) ORTONA SAID THAT CONSENSUS AT THE PSC FORMED AROUND A 
PLAN TO WAIT, IN ORDER TO GIVE A RECENT EU DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
IN MINSK (EXPRESSING CONCERN OVER THE LACK OF PROGRESS ON THE 
STEP-BY-STEP/BENCHMARK INITIATIVES) A CHANCE TO SINK IN WITH 
THE LUKASHENKO REGIME.  THE EU ALSO WANTS TO WAIT UNTIL THERE 
ARE CLEARER SIGNALS WHETHER LUKASHENKO WILL CALL A REFERENDUM 
ON HIS OWN POLITICAL FUTURE.  WHEN THE EU IS SATISFIED THE 
TIMING IS RIGHT, THE REF A TEXT CAN BE USED ALMOST AS 
DRAFTED, PREDICTED ORTONA.
