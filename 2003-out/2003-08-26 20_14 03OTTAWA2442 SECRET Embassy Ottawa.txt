Classified By: Classified by Economics Counselor Wendy Moore.  Reason 1 
.5 (b and d). 
 
 
¶1. (S) Action request:  The GOC has requested additional 
information on PVOE, the Palestinian Association in Austria, 
which may be provided through State or ORCA channels. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On August 26, the GOC held an interagency meeting 
to review ref B demarche on the U.S. decision to add HAMAS 
names to the asset freeze list. They do not have sufficient 
information on PVOE to reach the "reasonable grounds" 
threshold and have requested USG assistance in providing 
other information that might be available. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The GOC is still considering action on the 
remaining names and designation has not been ruled out.  The 
decision is being made by the geographical bureau.  Canada 
has already queried its EU mission, and will consider views 
of its missions in the region when making a decision.
