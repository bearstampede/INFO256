SUBJECT: NORTH KOREA TO OPEN EMBASSY IN KUWAIT 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reason 1.5 (d) 
 
(C) During a courtesy call with the Ambassador on July 14, 
ROK Ambassador In Kook Park stated that the GOK recently 
agreed to upgrade the status of North Korea's existing trade 
office to that of an Embassy.  This was in response to 
repeated requests from Pyong Yang that peaked during the 
fighting in Iraq.  Although he did not give a precise date, 
Ambassador Park said the government of North Korea would be 
opening its embassy in the near future.  Comment: Given the 
number of North Korean nationals working in the State of 
Kuwait (about 3,000, according to Ambassador Park), the 
government's desire to establish an embassy here is 
understandable from a practical point of view.  Our concern, 
however, is that the move not prove a harbinger of a return 
to the policy of active non-alignment practiced by Kuwait 
prior to the Gulf War.
