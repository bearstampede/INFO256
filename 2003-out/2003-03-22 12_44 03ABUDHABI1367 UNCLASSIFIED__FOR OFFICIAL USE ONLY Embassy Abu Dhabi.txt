SUBJECT: UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE UAE 
 
 
¶1. (U) Local Arabic language press reported on March 
15 that the official unemployment rate in the UAE was 
2.6%, the lowest in the Arab world.  The Ministry of 
Labor and Social Affairs supplied this information to 
the Arab Labor Force Conference held in Tunisia in 
early March.  The official rate reported by the 
Emiratis was only for nationals and did not include 
unemployment in the foreign labor force. The following 
day however, local Arabic language press reported that 
the unemployment rate among nationals in Dubai was 
10.43%, a statistic released by Dubai Municipality. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: If the unemployment rate among 
nationals is over 10% in Dubai, the second largest 
Emirate in the UAE, unemployment for the country is 
unlikely to be as low as 2.6%.  National government 
unemployment figures are probably unreliable -- UAE 
macroeconomic information in general is suspect -- 
reflecting political agendas more than detailed and 
accurate statistical analysis.  The Dubai figure is 
likely to be more credible as many nationals remain 
voluntarily unemployed due to unrealistic salary and 
work expectations even though the government has 
sought to convince Emiratis -- through training and 
work placement programs -- to consider a wider range 
of jobs, particularly in the private sector. 
Unfortunately, most Emiratis prefer the easier work 
environment and better benefits of the public sector, 
despite the fact that most of the jobs are in the 
private realm.
