SUBJECT: CANADA SUPPORTS IRAN NONCOMPLIANCE RESOLUTION AT 
SEPTEMBER IAEA BOG 
 
REF: STATE 245961 
 
Classified By: POLMIN COUNSELOR BRIAN FLORA.  REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (C) Canadian DFAIT Nuclear Non-Proliferation Deputy 
Director Terry Wood assured us that the GOC fully supports a 
finding of noncompliance at the September IAEA Board of 
Governors meeting and wants to assist in any way possible. 
Though Canada already was inclined to support a resolution, 
Wood said, the DG's report on Iran released August 26 makes 
such a finding imperative. 
 
¶2. (C) Canada is prepared to lobby other BoG members that 
remain unconvinced -- in capitals as deemed necessary.  Wood 
recommends the lobbying take place this week, and in 
coordinated manner, to assure maximum impact and 
effectiveness.  He added that DFAIT and the Canadian Mission 
at UNVIE discussed the matter at length yesterday and are in 
synch on this approach.
