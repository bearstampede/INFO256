 ¶1. (SBU)  CDA Tim Smith presented reftel talking points to 
Djiboutian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Secretary General 
Badri Ali Bogoreh October 2.  Bogoreh expressed interest in 
the program.  He promised to circulate the Interdiction 
Principles within the GoDj.  He wished to know how 
counter-terrorism measures being taken by Djibouti in 
connection with Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa 
(CJTF-HOA) might relate to the program. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Bogoreh suggested we contact him when we receive 
further information. He believes PSI  is particularly 
important to Djibouti because of the country's critical role 
as both a regional shipping center and a prominent meber of 
the anti-teror coalition.
