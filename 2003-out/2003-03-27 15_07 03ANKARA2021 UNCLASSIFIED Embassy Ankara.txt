Status of INL-funded Equipment 
 ------------------------------ 
 
 
Â¶1.  (U) There has been no change in the status of INL-funded 
vehicles provided to the Turkish Grain Board (TMO), dogs 
provided for Turkish Customs, computers for Turkish Customs 
and TMO, and intercept equipment for the Turkish National 
Police (TNP) since report made in reftel B.  Regarding the 
status of TNP communications and miscellaneous equipment, TNP 
officials have informed us that the equipment we provided in 
the mid-1990s is in good condition, but because it is now old 
technology it has been passed on to smaller provinces.  In 
the cities, TNP makes full use of its newer INL-funded 
equipment.  TNP and Customs officials tell us fiberscopes are 
still useful.  Customs officials are also happy with the ion 
scanners, claiming that they have helped them increase drug 
seizures.
