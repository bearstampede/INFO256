SUBJECT: DOMINICAN CONGRESSMAN APPEARS IN COURT ON ALIEN 
SMUGGLING CHARGES 
 
REF: SANTO DOMINGO 3256 (NOTAL) 
 
Classified By: CHARGE D'AFFAIRES LISA KUBISKE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B/D) 
 
¶1. (U) Trial proceedings began on October 22 against accused alien smuggler Congressman Guillermo Radhames "Ramos" Garcia.   After months of evading police arrest before Congress reconvened in August, Garcia surprised observers by appearing before the Supreme Court without his attorneys.  Garcia announced that he would not renounce his parliamentary immunity, even though he had previously told the press that he would.  The Supreme Court ordered Garcia to reappear October 30 with his attorneys, at which time the case will be sent to a criminal tribunal.  A criminal tribunal is scheduled to hold a second hearing on December 3 after all witnesses have been notified to appear. 
 
¶2. (U) The judges designated an interpreter for the two 
Chinese nationals accused as co-conspirators and refused to 
release them on bail.  At least three employees of the 
Directorate of Migration, including a fired supervisor, had 
also been implicated, but according to local press were not 
subpoenaed in time to appear for the October 22 hearing. 
Attorney General Victor Cespedes told Ecopol counselor and 
poloffs that these three suspects had in fact been subpoenaed but had refused to accept the court order, and that they would be subpoenaed two more times before being arrested. 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT: Garcia,s appearance before the Supreme Court was definitely a surprise move, made possible by the Attorney General,s submission, finally, of the documentation required for the Supreme Court to begin proceedings.  Cespedes, explanation regarding the missing additional defendants may have been too pat, since some of the accused have been imprisoned well over a year while the accused public officials remain free.
