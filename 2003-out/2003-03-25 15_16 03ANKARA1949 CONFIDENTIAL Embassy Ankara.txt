(C) Poloff March 25 delivered Reftel talking points to Serra 
Erarslan, head of the MFA Iraq and Gulf Countries Department. 
 Erarslan said the GOT opposes discussion of Iraq in the 
General Assembly.  She said the GOT will consider the USG 
position urging allies to support the Coalition effort in any 
open UNSC session on Iraq, but she did not know whether the 
GOT would instruct its Permrep to speak at such a session.
