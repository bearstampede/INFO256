Ref:  State 92117 
 
(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of 
Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
¶1. (C) Per Reftel, Mission has no information re 
European Union intervention against the bilateral 
U.S./Sri Lanka Article 98 agreement prior to the 
November 22, 2002, signing of the agreement.  There are 
indications, however, that the Germans and Dutch 
approached the GSL through the Sri Lankan ambassador in 
Brussels about the issue -- but to no avail. 
 
¶2. (C) In regards to the Maldives, Mission has no reason 
to believe that there has been any intervention by the 
EU.  Mission expects the non-surrender agreement with 
the Maldives to be finalized soon. 
 
¶3. (U) Minimize considered.
