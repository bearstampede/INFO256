SUBJECT: GOZ EXTENDS EMERGENCY ON HIV/AIDS 
 
 
¶1.  The Government of Zimbabwe declared, in a statutory 
instrument in the January 17 Government Gazette, an emergency 
on HIV/AIDS for a period of five years effective from 1 
January 2003.  The emergency declaration allows the State or 
persons authorized in writing by the Minister of Justice, 
Legal and Parliamentary Affairs under the Patents Act 
     (a) to make or use any patented drug, including any 
antiretroviral drug used in the treatment of persons 
suffering from HIV/AIDS; 
     (b) to import generic drugs used in the treatment of 
persons suffering from HIV/AIDS. 
With the extension of the declaration of emergency--Zimbabwe 
first declared a six-month emergency in May 2002--Zimbabwe 
can get around patent restrictions to more easily access 
patented HIV/AIDS drugs. 
 
¶2.  Comment: Even with this declaration of emergency, 
Zimbabwe, which has one of the highest adult HIV infection 
rates, will have a difficult time both producing and 
importing drugs.  The economic crisis has crippled the health 
care industry and the shortage of foreign exchange limits the 
GOZ's ability to import drugs, even generics produced under 
compulsory license from third countries.  End Comment.
