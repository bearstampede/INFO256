ASSEMBLY FOR YEMEN

     ¶B. STATE 123459 
 
¶1. (U) On May 17, Pol/econoff received a call from Acting 
Minister of Health Abdel Kader Munibari informing post that 
he would not/not be traveling to Geneva for the World Health 
Assembly Meeting.   Advisor to the Minister, Dr. Ghazi Ismael 
will lead the delegation. The reason for the personnel change 
became apparent May 18, as Dr. Munibari was not reappointed 
as Minister of Health in the new Cabinet announced that day. 
 
¶2. (U) For US Mission Geneva: if possible, please reissue 
invitation in the name of Dr. Ghazi Ismael as the 
representative for Yemen to the lunch hosted by Secretary 
Thompson for the board of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria. Post appreciates mission assistance 
in this matter.
