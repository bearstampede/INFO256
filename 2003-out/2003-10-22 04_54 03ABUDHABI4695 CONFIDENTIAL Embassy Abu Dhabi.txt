SUBJECT:  UAE: ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT UPDATE 
 
Ref: A) Abu Dhabi 4670, B) State 236863 
 
(U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶1. (C) The Ambassador briefed Deputy Prime Minister 
and MinState for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan Bin 
Zayed Al-Nahyan (HBZ) October 19 on the status of our 
Article 98 agreement with the Emiratis.  She said the 
UAE inter-agency panel appeared to be stuck on the 
"where it is appropriate" language in the preambular 
paragraph pertaining to investigation and 
persecution.  The Ambassador encouraged HBZ to have a 
diplomatic note exchange concluded prior to his visit 
to the United States (ref A). 
 
¶2. (C) HBZ asked his staff to call the Ministry of 
Justice to urge them to try to resolve the issue, 
which has not budged since the Article 98 text was 
delivered to the Emiratis in mid-August (ref B).  The 
Ambassador proposed another DVC if the deadlock could 
not be broken internally, and told HBZ that Under 
Secretary for Arms Control and International Security 
 
SIPDIS 
Assistance Bolton had personally called her to 
inquire on progress and was hoping the Article 98 
agreement would be concluded prior to HBZ's visit.
