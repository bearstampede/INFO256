SUBJECT: GUATEMALAN ELECTIONS: VERY PRELIMINARY RESULTS 
SHOW FRG TRAILING AT 8 PM ON ELECTION NIGHT 
 
 
¶1. Early election results from around the country (often 
representing only one or two tables) at 8 p.m. on election 
night have given the following results.  We note that the 
sample is too small to be considered statistically reliable, 
but does reflect the vote from the four corners of the 
country.  Berger appears to have an early lead in Guatemala 
City and eastern Guatemala, and Colom is ahead in the 
indigenous west.  Rios Montt is a distant third nationwide.

¶2. FRG leaders called a press conference late in the 
afternoon on November 9 to complain that leading daily 
"Prensa Libre" and anti-government cable TV Guatevision had 
violated the electoral law by issuing anti-FRG propaganda on 
election day. "Prensa Libre" printed a special edition at 
mid-day, which headlined "FRG JEERED-AT," referring to the 
fact that some individuals jeered at Rios Montt when he 
voted.  The special edition was sold throughout the country, 
including inside voting centers (an Embassy officer purchased 
one inside a voting center).  Guatevision has been showing a 
music video all day which talks about the importance of 
making the right choices and uses pictures of masked FRG 
protesters burning tires on July 24.  FRG leaders called on 
the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) to take legal action 
against "Prensa Libre" and Guatevision.  The FRG leaders also 
complained that large numbers of their supporters (like those 
of other parties) were disenfranchised by the problems with 
the voter registry and long delays voters suffered around the 
country at voting centers. 
 
¶3. Tensions remain high in several small towns where voting 
lines remained long at the time the polls were supposed to 
close.  The TSE has announced that, in areas where large 
numbers of intending voters were still waiting to have their 
documents validated, polls will remain open until midnight.
