(BWC) MEETINGS 
 
REF: STATE 89707 
 
(U) Canada agrees with us that there is plenty of work to be 
done within the scope of the 2003-2005 BWC agenda (reftel), 
and will encourage contributions by BWC member countries. 
Marina Laker, Foreign Affairs Deputy Director for 
Non-Proliferation, told us that Canada strongly promotes 
national measures, and expects to have three papers of its 
own for the August 18-29 Expert Group meeting.  Two of its 
papers will deal with CBRN controls and terrorism, and one 
will be an update on Canada's BTWC implementation 
legislation.  The latter is part of Omnibus Public Safety Act 
C-17, which is currently in Parliamentary Committee.  BTWC 
implementation is not controversial, but C-17 has been held 
up by debate on other aspects of the bill such as air 
passenger information.
