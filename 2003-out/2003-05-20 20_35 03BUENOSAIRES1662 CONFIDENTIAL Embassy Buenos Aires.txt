¶1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  PRESIDENT-ELECT NESTOR KIRCHNER ANNOUNCED 
THE COMPOSITION OF HIS CABINET ON MAY 20.  AS KIRCHNER HAD 
STATED DURING THE CAMPAIGN, ROBERTO LAVAGNA WILL CONTINUE ON 
AS ECONOMY MINISTER.  THE BIGGEST SURPRISES WERE HIS 
SELECTION OF JUDICIAL AFFAIRS EXPERT RAFAEL BIELSA AS FOREIGN 
MINISTER AND MEDICAL DOCTOR AND STAUNCH DUHALDISTA JOSE 
PAMPURO AS DEFENSE MINISTER, GIVEN THAT NEITHER HAS MUCH 
EXPERIENCE IN EITHER AREA.  CLOSE KIRCHNER ASSOCIATE ALBERTO 
FERNANDEZ, WHO WAS THE EMBASSY'S CLOSEST CONTACT IN THE 
KIRCHNER CAMPAIGN, WILL SERVE AS CHIEF OF CABINET.  OF THE 13 
CABINET-LEVEL APPOINTMENTS, FIVE ARE LOYAL KIRCHNER 
ASSOCIATES, FOUR ARE CARRYOVERS FROM THE DUHALDE 
ADMINISTRATION, AND THE REMAINING FOUR ARE MORE POLITICALLY 
INDEPENDENT - ORIENTED.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT KIRCHNER'S CABINET 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U)  PRESIDENT-ELECT NESTOR KIRCHNER ANNOUNCED THE MAKEUP 
OF HIS CABINET ON THE AFTERNOON OF MAY 20 FROM HIS HOME 
PROVINCE OF SANTA CRUZ, WHERE HE HAS SERVED AS GOVERNOR FOR 
THE PAST 12 YEARS. 
 
-- THE ONLY STRUCTURAL INNOVATION IN KIRCHNER'S CABINET WILL 
BE THE CREATION OF A MINISTRY OF FEDERAL PLANNING, PUBLIC 
INVESTMENT, AND SERVICES -- REFLECTING KIRCHNER'S PREFERENCE 
AS SANTA CRUZ GOVERNOR FOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS.  TO 
ACCOMMODATE THIS CHANGE, THE MINISTRY OF PRODUCTION WILL 
REVERT TO ITS PREVIOUS STATUS AS PART OF THE MINISTRY OF 
ECONOMY.  IN ADDITION, THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE 
AND TECHNOLOGY WILL BE CALLED THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND 
CULTURE.  (UNDER THE ARGENTINE CONSTITUTION, THE CHIEF OF 
CABINET PRESIDES OVER A CABINET OF TEN OTHER MINISTERS.  THE 
POSTS OF SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY AND SECRETARY OF 
STATE INTELLIGENCE ARE LOOSELY REFERRED TO AS CABINET-LEVEL 
POSTS, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT STRICTLY SPEAKING CABINET POSTS 
AS THE CONSTITUTION DEFINES IT.) 
 
-- AT LEAST FIVE OF THE APPOINTMENTS ARE CLOSE KIRCHNER 
ASSOCIATES.  ALBERTO FERNANDEZ, HIS CLOSEST ADVISOR (OTHER 
THAN PERHAPS HIS WIFE CHRISTINA FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER), WILL 
SERVE AS CHIEF OF CABINET.  THE OTHERS INCLUDE JULIO DE VIDO 
(FEDERAL PLANNING, PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND SERVICES), 
PRESIDENTIAL SISTER ALICIA KIRCHNER (SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT), 
OSCAR PARRILLI (SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY), AND 
SERGIO ACEVEDO (SECRETARY FOR STATE INTELLIGENCE). 
 
-- KIRCHNER RETAINED FOUR OF DUHALDE'S HIGH-RANKING 
OFFICIALS.  HOWEVER, ECONOMY MINISTER ROBERTO LAVAGNA AND 
HEALTH MINISTER GINES GONZALEZ GARCIA APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN 
CHOSEN MORE ON THEIR OWN MERITS THAN FOR ANY TIES THEY MIGHT 
HAVE HAD WITH DUHALDE.  THE TWO DIEHARD DUHALDE LOYALISTS IN 
KIRCHNER'S CABINET WILL BE JOSE PAMPURO (DEFENSE, FORMERLY 
SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY) AND ANIBAL FERNANDEZ 
(INTERIOR, FORMERLY MINISTER OF PRODUCTION). 
 
-- KIRCHNER SELECTED TWO CURRENT MAYORAL CANDIDATES FOR THE 
FEDERAL CAPITAL TO HIS CABINET, RAFAEL BIELSA (FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS) AND GUSTAVO BELIZ (JUSTICE).  CHOOSING BOTH OF THEM 
TO HIS CABINET GIVES KIRCHNER MORE FLEXIBILITY TO SUPPORT 
CURRENT MAYOR ANIBAL IBARRA IN THE AUGUST 24 ELECTIONS, WHERE 
IBARRA WILL COMPETE AGAINST THE FRONTRUNNER, BUSINESSMAN 
MAURICO MACRI.  A MEMBER OF IBARRA'S ADMINISTRATION IN THE 
FEDERAL CAPITAL, MINISTER OF EDUCATION DANIEL FILMUS, WILL 
SERVE IN KIRCHNER'S CABINET AS WELL. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
KIRCHNER'S CABINET: BIOGRAPHICAL COMMENTS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C)  CHIEF OF CABINET:  ALBERTO FERNANDEZ.  FERNANDEZ IS 
A 44-YEAR-OLD LOCAL PJ LEGISLATOR IN THE CITY OF BUENOS AIRES 
AND AN EXPERT IN CRIMINAL LAW WITH A PRIVATE LAW PRACTICE. 
HE HAS DIRECTED KIRCHNER'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN EFFORT FROM 
THE BEGINNING AND HAS EMERGED AS ONE OF KIRCHNER'S CLOSEST 
ADVISORS.  IN THE LATE 1980S, HE HELD MID-LEVEL POSTS IN THE 
MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, AND IN 1989, WAS NAMED NATIONAL 
SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE.  DURING 1996-2000, HE SERVED AS 
VICE PRESIDENT FOR BAPRO, ONE OF THE GOVERNING ENTITIES OF 
THE BANCO DE LA PROVINCIA DE BUENOS AIRES.  HE WAS FIRST 
ELECTED TO THE CITY LEGISLATURE FOR THE FEDERAL CAPITAL IN 
¶2000.  POLOFFS HAVE FOUND FERNANDEZ TO BE ARTICULATE AND 
FORTHCOMING INTERLOCUTOR, AND QUITE OPEN TO PRIVATE MEETINGS 
WITH THE EMBASSY -- IN STARK CONTRAST TO KIRCHNER. 
 
¶4.  (C)  MINISTER OF INTERIOR:  ANIBAL FERNANDEZ.  PRIOR TO 
BECOMING DUHALDE'S MINISTER OF PRODUCTION IN OCTOBER 2002, HE 
SERVED AS PRESIDENT DUHALDE'S FIRST SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE 
PRESIDENCY, A HIGH-PROFILE JOB (RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENTIAL SPENDING AND POLICY 
ARTICULATION WITH OTHER MINISTERS) DURING A TURBULENT PERIOD 
IN ARGENTINE HISTORY.  FERNANDEZ GAINED POLITICAL PROMINENCE 
IN THE BUENOS AIRES PJ MACHINE BY SERVING AS MAYOR OF THE 
WORKING CLASS BUENOS AIRES SUBURB OF QUILMES AND LATER, IN 
2001, AS THEN-GOVERNOR CARLOS RUCKAUF'S MINISTER OF LABOR. 
HE FACED DRAMATIC CONFRONTATIONS DURING HIS TENURE AS MAYOR 
AND PROVINCIAL LABOR MINISTER, INCLUDING HAVING FACED CHARGES 
OF CORRUPTION AND HAVING BEEN BRIEFLY HELD HOSTAGE IN THE 
MINISTRY BY PIQUETERO FAMILIES DEMANDING RENEWAL OF JOB 
SUBSIDIES.  IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH THE CHARGES WERE NEVER 
FULLY SUBSTANTIATED, EMBASSY CONTACTS ALLEGED THAT WHILE 
PROVINCIAL LABOR MINISTER, FERNANDEZ AND OTHER PJ PROVINCIAL 
LEADERS NOT ONLY REMAINED PASSIVE WHILE THE LOOTINGS AND 
VIOLENCE RAGED IN DECEMBER 2001 AND ULTIMATELY LED TO 
PRESIDENT FERNANDO DE LA RUA'S RESIGNATION, BUT ACTIVELY 
STIMULATED THE UNREST.  THE 46-YEAR-OLD FERNANDEZ IS A PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTANT AND LAWYER BY TRAINING.  IN THE ARGENTINE SYSTEM, 
THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR'S CHIEF RESPONSIBILITY IS MANAGING 
THE GOA'S CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PROVINCES.  (THIS 
AND ADDITIONAL BIO INFORMATION ON FERNANDEZ WAS PREVIOUSLY 
REPORTED IN REF A). 
 
¶5.  (U)  MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, FOREIGN TRADE, AND 
WORSHIP:  RAFAEL BIELSA.  A LAWYER BY TRAINING, BIELSA IS AN 
EXPERT IN JUDICIAL AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, AND A 
STRONG ADVOCATE FOR JUDICIAL TRANSPARENCY.  HIS PERONIST 
CREDENTIALS DATE BACK TO THE 1970S, BUT HE AFFILIATED WITH 
FREPASO, A PERONIST SPLINTER GROUP, IN THE 1990S.  DURING THE 
DE LA RUA ADMINISTRATION, BIELSA SERVED AS CHAIRMAN OF THE 
NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR JUDICIAL REFORM AND THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE NATIONAL COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE.  HIS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST 
DE LA RUA'S INTELLIGENCE SECRETARY FERNANDO DE SANTIBANEZ FOR 
MISUSING FUNDS LED TO THE LATTER'S RESIGNATION IN OCTOBER 
¶2000.  THE 50-YEAR-OLD BIELSA RECEIVED HIS LAW DEGREE FROM 
THE UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES AND ALSO STUDIED AT THE 
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.  HIS BROTHER MARCELO IS THE COACH OF 
THE ARGENTINE NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM.  BIELSA WAS A SURPRISE 
CHOICE FOR THIS POST, HAVING BEEN RUMORED INSTEAD AS 
KIRCHNER'S MINISTER OF JUSTICE.  HE DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE 
ANY FOREIGN AFFAIRS EXPERIENCE.  A SENIOR FOREIGN MINISTRY 
OFFICIAL ANTICIPATES HE WILL KEEP MARTIN REDRADO ON AS DEPUTY 
FOREIGN MINISTER. 
 
¶6.  (U)  MINISTER OF DEFENSE:  JOSE PAMPURO.  AS REPORTED IN 
REF B, PAMPURO SERVED AS DUHALDE'S PRIVATE SECRETARY IN 2002, 
BECOMING SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY IN OCTOBER OF 
THAT YEAR.  A MEDICAL SURGEON BY TRAINING, HE WAS MINISTER OF 
HEALTH OF THE PROVINCE OF BUENOS AIRES DURING DUHALDE'S 
TENURE AS GOVERNOR IN THE 1990S.  HE ALSO SERVED PREVIOUSLY 
AS A NATIONAL DEPUTY IN THE LATE 1980S.  HE AND DUHALDE HAVE 
KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR 20 YEARS, AND HE ENJOYS THE CONFIDENCE 
OF THE CURRENT PRESIDENT TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HE ONCE 
DECLARED, "I AM DUHALDE."  THE 53-YEAR-OLD PAMPURO SPEAKS 
ENGLISH AND ONCE TOOK A SIX-MONTH SPECIALIZATION COURSE AT 
MT. SINAI HOSPITAL IN NEW YORK. 
 
¶7.  (U)  MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND PRODUCTION:  ROBERTO 
LAVAGNA.  DUHALDE'S CURRENT MINISTER OF ECONOMY WAS THE ONLY 
NAME EXPLICITLY ANNOUNCED IN ADVANCE BY THEN-CANDIDATE 
KIRCHNER PRIOR TO THE ELECTION.  ONE INFLUENTIAL MEMBER OF 
KIRCHNER'S CAMPAIGN TOLD EMBASSY OFFICERS THAT KIRCHNER HAS 
MET WITH LAVAGNA FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR PER DAY SINCE KIRCHNER 
ANNOUNCED THAT LAVAGNA WOULD BE HIS CHOICE FOR ECONOMY 
MINISTER. 
 
¶8.  (C)  MINISTER OF FEDERAL PLANNING, PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND 
SERVICES:  JULIO DE VIDO.  WHILE SERVING AS KIRCHNER'S 
MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT OF SANTA CRUZ, DE VIDO COORDINATED THE 
TECHNICAL TEAM THAT PREPARED THE CANDIDATE'S PLAN OF 
GOVERNMENT (SEPTEL).  DE VIDO WAS BORN IN SANTA CRUZ AND IS 
CONSIDERED CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT.  HE FORMERLY SERVED 
AS THE PROVINCIAL MINISTER OF ECONOMY UNDER KIRCHNER.  DURING 
A MAY 14 MEETING WITH ECONCOUNS, DE VIDO STRESSED THE 
IMPORTANCE THAT THE KIRCHNER ADMINISTRATION WOULD PAY TO 
RUNNING A PRIMARY FISCAL SURPLUS "FROM DAY ONE." 
 
¶9.  (U)  MINISTER OF JUSTICE, SECURITY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS: 
GUSTAVO BELIZ.  ONCE VIEWED AS FORMER PRESIDENT CARLOS 
MENEM'S PROTEGE BEFORE THEIR FALLING OUT, BELIZ WAS NAMED 
MENEM'S INTERIOR MINISTER IN 1992 WHILE ONLY 30 YEARS OLD. 
HE RESIGNED THE POST A YEAR LATER, ALLEGING THAT HIS EFFORTS 
TO CLEAN UP THE MINISTRY'S ADMINISTRATION WERE BEING THWARTED 
BY OTHERS IN THE GOVERNMENT.  A PERSISTENT CRITIC OF 
CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL MANIPULATION OF THE JUDICIARY, HE 
RESIGNED HIS PJ PARTY MEMBERSHIP IN EARLY 1996.  UNDER HIS 
OWN "NEW LEADERSHIP PARTY" BANNER, HE RAN A SURPRISINGLY 
STRONG BUT UNSUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN FOR MAYOR OF THE FEDERAL 
CAPITAL THAT YEAR.  IN 2000, HE RAN AS DOMINGO CAVALLO'S 
RUNNING MATE IN THE MAYORAL RACE FOR THE FEDERAL CAPITAL, BUT 
CAVALLO WAS DEFEATED BY CURRENT MAYOR ANIBAL IBARRA.  BELIZ'S 
ATTEMPT TO WIN A NATIONAL SENATE SEAT FOR THE FEDERAL CAPITAL 
IN 2001 ENDED UP IN A STILL-UNRESOLVED COURT DISPUTE WITH 
SOCIALIST CANDIDATE ALFREDO BRAVO.  THE 40-YEAR-OLD BELIZ HAS 
A LAW DEGREE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES.  IN THE 
PRESS, BELIZ'S AUSTERE LIFESTYLE AND DEVOUT CATHOLICISM ARE 
HIS TWO MOST FREQUENTLY CITED PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES. 
 
¶10.  (U)  MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE:  DANIEL FILMUS. 
THE 47-YEAR-OLD FILMUS IS CURRENTLY SECRETARY OF EDUCATION 
FOR THE FEDERAL CAPITAL, WHERE HIS WORK WAS PRAISED BY 
THEN-CANDIDATE KIRCHNER.  FILMUS RECEIVED HIS UNDERGRADUATE 
DEGREE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES IN 1977 AND HIS 
MASTERS DEGREE FROM THE FEDERAL UNIVERSITY FLUMINENSE 
(BRAZIL) IN 1989. 
 
¶11.  (U)  MINISTER OF LABOR, EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY: 
CARLOS TOMADA.  THE LAWYER TOMADA HAS SERVED IN VARIOUS 
POSITIONS IN THE LABOR MINISTRY OVER THE YEARS, INCLUDING 
HAVING HEADED THE SECTION CHARGED WITH RESOLVING LABOR - 
MANAGEMENT DISPUTES.  MOST RECENTLY, HE WAS THE SECRETARY OF 
LABOR -- ESSENTIALLY, DEPUTY MINISTER -- IN THE FIRST FEW 
MONTHS OF THE DUHALDE GOVERNMENT UNDER THEN-MINISTER ALFREDO 
ATANASOF.  TOMADA RESIGNED THAT POSITION WHEN ATANASOF LEFT 
THE MINISTRY TO BECOME CHIEF OF STAFF AND GRACIELA CAMANO 
BECAME MINISTER.  TOMADA HAS HIS OWN LAW OFFICE AND, AS A 
PROFESSOR, HAS HEADED THE LABOR RELATIONS PROGRAM OF THE 
SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES. 
IN 1990, THE EMBASSY SENT TOMADA ON AN INDIVIDUAL 
INTERNATIONAL VISITOR PROGRAM, AND HE HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH 
EMBASSY LABOR ATTACHES SINCE THEN, PARTICULARLY IN PROMOTING 
ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION, SUCH AS MEDIATION AND 
CONCILIATION.  IN THE ARGENTINE SYSTEM, THE POST OF LABOR 
MINISTER IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE MINISTRY HAS 
ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY OVER THE MANAGEMENT OF MANY OF THE 
EMPLOYMENT SUBSIDY PROGRAMS, INCLUDING OVER 2 MILLION 
BENEFICIARIES IN THE HEADS OF HOUSEHOLD SUBSIDY ALONE. 
 
¶12.  (U)  MINISTER OF HEALTH:  GINES GONZALEZ GARCIA. 
PRESIDENT DUHALDE APPOINTED GONZALEZ GARCIA AS HIS MINISTER 
OF HEALTH IN OCTOBER 2002.  DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, 
KIRCHNER HAD GIVEN SIGNALS THAT GONZALEZ GARCIA WOULD STAY IN 
THAT POST WERE HE TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY, LARGELY BECAUSE OF 
THE WIDESPREAD PUBLIC ACCLAIM HE ENJOYED AS A RESULT OF HIS 
POLICIES TO LOWER DRUG PRICES.  PRESS REPORTS INDICATE THAT 
THE 57-YEAR-OLD MINISTER-DESIGNATE HAS A LONG-STANDING 
ACQUAINTANCE WITH KIRCHNER.  GONAZALEZ GARCIA RECEIVED HIS 
MEDICAL DEGREE FROM THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF CORDOBA IN 
1968 AND IS A MEMBER OF NUMEROUS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN 
ARGENTINA AND ABROAD, INCLUDING THE AMERICAN MEDICAL 
ASSOCIATION. 
 
¶13.  (U)  MINISTER OF SOCIAL ACTION:  ALICIA KIRCHNER. 
KIRCHNER'S OLDER SISTER CURRENTLY SERVES IN THIS CAPACITY IN 
KIRCHNER'S GUBERNATORIAL ADMINISTRATION IN SANTA CRUZ. 
ALICIA KIRCHNER HAD BEEN RUMORED FOR THIS POSITION FOR THE 
PAST SEVERAL DAYS; THE PRESIDENT-ELECT'S ONLY DOUBTS 
REPORTEDLY CONCERNED THE ADVISABILITY OF NAMING A RELATIVE TO 
A CABINET POST. 
 
¶14.  (U)  SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY:  OSCAR 
PARRILLI.  KIRCHNER'S TOP CAMPAIGN ADVISOR IN THE PROVINCE OF 
NEUQUEN, PARRILLI IS AN EX-NATIONAL DEPUTY AND PROVINCIAL 
LAWMAKER.  ALONG WITH KIRCHNER'S WIFE, SENATOR CHRISTINA 
FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER, HE STRONGLY CRITICIZED THE VIOLENCE 
FOMENTED BY PJ SENATOR LUIS BARRIONUEVO IN CATAMARCA IN EARLY 
MARCH 2002 THAT LED TO THE POSTPONEMENT OF PROVINCIAL 
ELECTIONS THERE.  OF ALL THE PERSONNEL ANNOUNCEMENTS MADE BY 
KIRCHNER, PARRILLI IS PERHAPS THE LEAST KNOWN. 
 
¶15.  (C)  SECRETARY FOR STATE INTELLIGENCE (SIDE):  SERGIO 
ACEVEDO.  ACEVEDO IS A 47-YEAR-OLD NATIONAL DEPUTY FROM 
KIRCHNER'S HOME PROVINCE OF SANTA CRUZ AND HAS SERVED IN 
RECENT YEARS AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE IMPEACHMENT COMMITTEE IN 
THE LOWER HOUSE.  IN THAT CAPACITY, HE SPEARHEADED EFFORTS IN 
2002 TO IMPEACH ALL NINE MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT, AN 
EFFORT THAT ULTIMATELY FELL SHORT OF THE TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY 
NEEDED IN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AFTER THE DUHALDE 
ADMINISTRATION ABANDONED ITS INITIAL SUPPORT FOR THE 
IMPEACHMENT EFFORT.  ACEVEDO FIRST SERVED IN THE CHAMBER OF 
DEPUTIES DURING THE PERIOD 1995-1999, THEN SERVED AS 
KIRCHNER'S VICE GOVERNOR IN SANTA CRUZ DURING 1999-2001, 
BEFORE RETURNING TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES IN 2001.  ACEVEDO 
IS A LAWYER BY TRAINING, HAVING RECEIVED HIS DEGREE FROM THE 
UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES IN 1979.  AS HEAD OF ARGENTINA'S 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, ACEVEDO WILL BE IN CHARGE OF BOTH 
FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC ESPIONAGE; SIDE ALSO IS AN IMPORTANT 
ELEMENT IN GOA COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS.  SIDE HAS A LONG 
HISTORY OF INVOLVEMENT IN DOMESTIC POLITICS FOR WHICH IT 
UTILIZES A LARGE NON-TRANSPARENT BUDGET PROCESS TO SUPPORT 
THE PRESIDENT'S POLITICAL OBJECTIVES.  HIS APPOINTMENT IS 
CLEARLY BASED MORE ON THE FACT THAT HE IS A CLOSE CONFIDANT 
OF KIRCHNER THAN ON ANY BACKGROUND IN INTELLIGENCE MATTERS. 
HIS ASSOCIATION WITH THE LEFT WING OF THE PERONIST PARTY AND 
HIS RUMORED HISTORY AS A FORMER MONTENERO GUERRILLA IN THE 
1970S, RAISE SOME DOUBTS ABOUT HIS INCLINATIONS ON FOREIGN 
INTELLIGENCE COOPERATION.
