(S) Ref (A) requested Embassy's recommendation on whether 
OPIC should provide a loan to the Turkish firm Diomed Tibbi 
Gerecler San. Ve Tic. A.S. and its manufacturing affiliate 
Plasset Ltd.  Embassy cannot endorse granting the loan, based 
on information that these companies have undertaken sales in 
violation of sanctions against Iraq (see ref B, which is 
classified at the Secret level).  We strongly recommend that 
OPIC obtain NP's approval before proceeding with this loan. 
We will send further, unclassified information on 
Diomed/Plasset septel.
