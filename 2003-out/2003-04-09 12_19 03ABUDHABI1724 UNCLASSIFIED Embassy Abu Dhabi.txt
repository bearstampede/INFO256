SUBJECT:  WHILE ROME BURNS, UAE CAMPUS FIDDLES, CALMLY 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  THE ABU DHABI CAMPUS AT THE UAE'S ZAYED UNIVERSITY 
(ZU) FOR WOMEN RECENTLY HELD A STUDENT BAZAAR TO EXHIBIT STUDENT 
PROJECTS AND ARTWORKS AND TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE UAE RED CRESCENT 
SOCIETY'S HUMANITARIAN AID DRIVE FOR IRAQI CHILDREN.  DURING THE 
BAZAAR, APAO DISCUSSED LOCAL EVENTS AND THE WAR IN IRAQ WITH ZU 
STUDENTS, STAFF, FACULTY, AND ADMINISTRATORS.  WHILE FRUSTRATION 
WITH THE WAR IN IRAQ AND DISMAY AT IMAGES OF IRAQI CIVILIAN 
CASUALTIES SIMMER BELOW THE SURFACE, LIFE AT ZU IS BUSINESS AS 
USUAL FOR EMIRATI STUDENTS, ARAB EXPATRIATE STAFF, AND WESTERN 
FACULTY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  ZU'S FEMALE STUDENTS, INCLUDING DAUGHTERS OF UAE ELITE, 
AVOIDED DISCUSSION OF THE WAR IN IRAQ WITH APAO.  INSTEAD, 
SEVERAL STUDENTS, INCLUDING THOSE WHO KNEW PAS STAFF PERSONALLY, 
TALKED WITH APAO ABOUT THE YOUNG AMBASSADORS AND OTHER 
INTERNATIONAL VISITORS EXCHANGE PROGRAMS.  ZU STUDENTS SEEMED 
MORE CONCERNED WITH INVITING US TO LOOK AT THEIR ARTWORK, TELLING 
US ABOUT THEIR POETRY, OR URGING US TO VOTE IN A CONTEST TO 
CHOOSE A BEST DRAWING RATHER THAN ENGAGING ON IRAQI CIVILIAN 
CASUALTIES, THE WAR IN IRAQ, AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY. 
 
¶3.  NEVERTHELESS, ZU STUDENTS REMAIN VERY CONCERNED WITH THE 
PLIGHT OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND, IN PARTICULAR, IRAQI CHILDREN. 
ONE OF ZU'S AMERICAN ADMINISTRATORS INFORMED APAO THAT "LOUDER, 
MORE RAUCOUS, AND PARTICIPATORY EVENTS" HAD BEEN PLANNED BY THE 
ZU STUDENT COUNCIL FOR THE BAZAAR.  HOWEVER, THE CAMPUS 
ADMINISTRATOR PUT A HALT TO THESE EVENTS AFTER RECEIVING A CALL 
FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS.  WHILE THE RESULT WAS A STUDENT BAZAAR 
ONE WOULD EXPECT AT ANY UNIVERSITY, THE ZU STUDENT COUNCIL VICE 
PRESIDENT RESIGNED AS COORDINATOR OF THE EVENT TO PROTEST THE 
ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO BAR THE PLANNED ACTIVITIES.   THE 
OFFICIAL ALSO EXPLAINED THAT STUDENTS HAD PLANNED A PEACE VIGIL 
LATER IN THE WEEK, BUT THIS WAS ALSO DENIED PERMISSION. 
 
¶4.  THE ADMINISTRATOR FURTHER NOTED THAT THE AMERICAN FACULTY 
WERE NOT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH LOCAL POLITICAL CONDITIONS.  WHILE 
NOTING TAXI DRIVERS SEEMED "MORE DISTANT" THAN USUAL, THE 
OFFICIAL REPORTED THAT NO AMERICAN FACULTY HAD RETURNED TO THE 
U.S. AS A RESULT OF THE WAR.  ONE CANADIAN FACULTY MEMBER 
RECENTLY RESIGNED BUT THIS WAS DUE TO PERSONAL AND FAMILY 
REASONS.   SEVERAL AMERICAN FACULTY MEMBERS REQUESTED 
CLARIFICATION OF THEIR CONTRACT STATUS IF AN EVACUATION OF ABU 
DHABI WAS NECESSARY, BUT LOCAL CONDITIONS DID NOT WARRANT A 
RESPONSE AT THIS TIME, THE OFFICIAL NOTED.  TO HEAD OFF ANY 
ADDITIONAL CONCERNS, THE ZU ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY MET WITH ZU'S 
DUBAI AND ABU DHABI STAFFS TO PROVIDE REASSURANCE AND TO 
ENCOURAGE THE FACULTY TO AVOID ANY CLASSROOM OR INFORMAL 
DISCUSSIONS WITH STUDENTS ON REGIONAL EVENTS UNLESS NECESSARY FOR 
COURSE PURPOSES.  AN INFORMAL CHAT WITH TWO AMERICAN FACULTY 
MEMBERS LENT SUPPORT TO THIS VIEW, AS THEY INDICATED THEY HAD NO 
INTENTION OR DESIRE TO LEAVE ABU DHABI IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 
 
¶5.  DURING THE BAZAAR, AN IRAQI STAFF MEMBER AND VENDOR EXPRESSED 
THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAR WITH THE APAO.  BOTH HAVE FAMILY 
MEMBERS IN IRAQ WITH WHOM THEY HAVE NOT COMMUNICATED FOR TWO 
WEEKS.  THE IRAQI STAFF MEMBER RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM HER FAMILY 
URGING HER TO GET HER FAMILY OUT OF BAGHDAD.  SHE LOST CONTACT 
WITH THEM BEFORE THE MESSAGE ARRIVED.  SIMILARLY, AN IRAQI VENDOR 
SELLING IRAQI ARTWORKS AND HANDICRAFTS CRIED AS SHE EXPLAINED THE 
HISTORY OF HER ARTWORKS.  SHE ALSO LOST CONTACT WITH FAMILY 
MEMBERS STILL IN IRAQ.  BOTH WERE FRUSTRATED BUT ONLY EXPRESSED 
THEIR CONCERNS FOR THEIR FAMILY'S WELFARE AND DID NOT COMMENT ON 
THEIR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO THE WAR.
