SUBJECT: FRENCH DENY NEGOTIATING WITH FARC FOR RELEASE OF 
INGRID BETANCOURT 
 
REF: A. PARIS 5356 
     ¶B. BRASILIA 2243 

CLASSIFIED BY: CHARGE D'AFFAIRES ALEX WOLFF FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
¶1.  (C) DURING AN AUGUST 7 MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER 
VILLEPIN'S CABINET DIRECTOR PIERRE VIMONT ON A RANGE OF 
ISSUES, CHARGE ASKED DIRECTLY WHETHER FRANCE HAD NEGOTIATED 
WITH THE FARC IN AN EFFORT TO SECURE THE RELEASE OF 
FRENCH-COLOMBIAN CITIZEN INGRID BETANCOURT.  VIMONT 
EXPLICITLY DENIED THAT THERE HAD BEEN ANY GOF CONTACT WITH 
THE FARC.  HE SAID THE FRENCH DISPATCH OF A C-130 AIRCRAFT TO 
MANAUS, BRAZIL HAD BEEN A PURELY HUMANITARIAN MISSION CARRIED 
OUT AT THE REQUEST OF BETANCOURT'S FAMILY, WHO HAD HAD 
INDICATIONS THAT THE FARC WAS ON THE POINT OF RELEASING 
INGRID. 
 
¶2.  (C) VIMONT DESCRIBED A SUCCESSION OF EVENTS THAT HAD 
CAUSED THE GOF TO TAKE A DECISION TO ATTEMPT TO BE HELPFUL TO 
THE BETANCOURT FAMILY, IF POSSIBLE.  ACCORDING TO VIMONT, AT 
SOME POINT BEFORE THE EARLY JULY DISPATCH OF THE FRENCH C-130 
TO MANAUS, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE BETANCOURT FAMILY 
RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT INGRID BETANCOURT WOULD BE RELEASED 
BY THE FARC DUE TO HEALTH CONCERNS.  COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT 
URIBE, WHO, WITH HIS MILITARY STAFF, REPORTEDLY CONSIDERED AN 
ASSAULT TO FREE BETANCOURT, WAS URGED BY THE BETANCOURT 
FAMILY TO AVOID AN ATTACK AND TO LET THEM TRY ANOTHER OPTION 
TO RETRIEVE INGRID.  THE FAMILY THEN CAME TO THE GOF WITH A 
REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE, HOPING TO FLY INGRID OUT OF BRAZIL 
AFTER THE FARC HAD RELEASED HER TO THEM.  VIMONT SAID THAT 
VILLEPIN HAD NOTIFIED THE URIBE GOVERNMENT OF THIS AS THE 
OPERATION WAS UNDER WAY, AND THAT THE GOC HAD SUBSEQUENTLY 
MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE REASONS FOR THE FRENCH 
INITIATIVE AND ITS HUMANITARIAN NATURE ("WE ALSO HAVE OUR 
PROBLEMS FROM THE BETANCOURT FAMILY"). 
 
¶3.  (C) VIMONT SAID THAT THE BRAZILIAN PRESS HAD MADE THREE 
ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING THE AFFAIR: A) THAT FRANCE HAD BEEN 
PREPARED TO PAY A RANSOM FOR BETANCOURT'S RELEASE; B) THAT 
THERE HAD BEEN ARMS ABOARD THE PLANE; AND, C) THAT FRANCE HAD 
TAKEN OUT A FARC COMMANDER ON THE PLANE FOR MEDICAL 
TREATMENT.  VIMONT SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY INVOLVED 
IN THE PLANNING OF THE MISSION AND HE CATEGORICALLY DENIED 
ALL THREE ALLEGATIONS.  HE SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN FOUR 
EMPTY SEATS ON THE PLANE, BUT THESE HAD BEEN INTENDED FOR 
INGRID, HER SISTER, A PRIEST WHO ACTED AS INTERMEDIARY FOR 
THE FAMILY, AND INGRID BETANCOURT'S FORMER PRESIDENTIAL 
CAMPAIGN MANAGER.
