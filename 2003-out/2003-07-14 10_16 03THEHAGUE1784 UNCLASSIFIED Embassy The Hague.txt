¶1. PER REF 02275, THE BUREAU OF INDUSTRY AND SECURITY 
REQUESTED POST THE HAGUE TO CONDUCT A POST-SHIPMENT 
VERIFICATION (PSV) ON ENERGIE EN MILIEUTECHNISCHE 
ADVIESBUREAU DAM (ABBREVIATED: EMAC). EMAC IS THE END- 
USER OF A THERMAL IMAGING CAMERA. SUBJECT ITEM IS 
SOLD BY LICENSE APPLICANT MIKRON INFRARED, INC., 
OAKLAND, NEW JERSEY. 
 
¶2. WITH AUTHORIZATION VIA E-MAIL FROM MR TOM ANDRUKONIS, 
DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT ANALYSIS, FSN NATASHA 
KEYLARD PERFORMED THE PSV ON EMAC.  FSN KEYLARD VISITED EMAC 
ON JULY 8, 2003, AND MET WITH THE COMPANY DIRECTOR, MR. 
FRANS VAN DAM. FSN KEYLARD PREVIOUSLY MET MR. FRANS VAN DAM 
WITH CO WARD IN DURING A PRE-SHIPMENT VERIFICATION IN 
OCTOBER, 2002.  MR. FRANS VAN DAM IS AN ENERGY SPECIALIST 
CONSULTANT AND WORKS OUT OF HIS HOME.  MR. FRANS VAN DAM IS 
A CONSULTANT AND INSPECTOR IN THE AREA OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY. 
HE ADVISES COMPANIES, PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS AND PARTS OF THE 
DUTCH GOVERNMENT ON HOW TO MAKE HOMES MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT. 
 
¶3. FSN KEYLARD VIEWED A THERMAL IMAGER WITH THE FOLLOWING 
IDENTIFYING MARKS: 
  -    BRAND: NEC THERMO TRACER 
-    TYPE; TH7102WX 
-    SERIAL NO. 2060675 
-    NEC SAN-EI INSTRUMENTS LTD STICKER ON THE SIDE OF THE 
IMAGER STATING MADE IN USA 
 
¶4. THE THERMAL IMAGER WILL BE USED FOR: PREVENTIVE 
MAINTENANCE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE MEDICAL AREA, 
AND TRAINING PURPOSES TO PROMOTE THE SALE AND USE OF THERMAL 
IMAGERS. MR. VAN DAM HAS TAKEN FLIR'S LEVEL I THERMAL IMAGER 
TRAINING IN BOSTON.  ALTHOUGH HE INITIALLY PLANNED TO TAKE 
THE FLIR LEVEL II TRAINING, HE HAS SWITCHED TO TRAININGS 
PROVIDED BY ACADEMY, ANOTHER US FIRM PROVIDING TRAINING ON 
THIS SYSTEM.  HE HAS JUST COMPLETED A TRAINER COURSE WITH 
ACADEMY, WHICH ALLOWS HIM TO TRAIN PROSPECTIVE TRAINERS. IN 
THE NEAR FUTURE, MR. VAN DAM INTENDS TO TAKE THE ACADEMY 
EQUIVALENT OF THE FLIR LEVEL II TRAINING. 
 
¶5. IN REFERENCE TO HIS TRAINING ACTIVITIES, MR. VAN DAM 
MIGHT BE CONDUCTING SESSIONS ABROAD. DEMONSTRATING HIS 
EAGERNESS TO COMPLY WITH THE LICENSE CONDITIONS, MR. VAN DAM 
INQUIRED WHETHER HE IS PERMITTED TO TAKE THE THERMAL IMAGER 
ABROAD WITH HIM FOR TRAINING AND DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES. 
THIS MATTER IS UNDER REVIEW AT BIS. 
 
¶6. ON THE MATTER OF A DISCREPANCY IN SUBJECT PRODUCT'S 
DOLLAR VALUE, MR. VAN DAM WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE AN INVOICE, 
WHICH SHOWED THAT THE CAMERA COST 29,850 EUROS (DATED: 
SEPTEMBER 2002), EXCLUDING ACCESSORIES. 
 
¶7. TO ENSURE MR. VAN DAM IS AWARE OF THE CONDITIONS UNDER 
WHICH THE EXPORT LICENSE WAS GRANTED, WE REVIEWED THE 
CONDITIONS ONCE AGAIN.  MR. VAN DAM UNDERSTANDS HIS 
OBLIGATIONS. 
 
¶8. REGARDING THE SECURITY OF THE THERMAL IMAGER, FSN KEYLARD 
FOUND THAT THE UNIT IS STORED IN A LARGE UNLOCKED CASE AND 
STORED IN AN AREA OF THE ATTIC (WHERE HIS OFFICE IS 
LOCATED), TO KEEP IT OUT OF SIGHT. HIS HOME IS LOCKED AND 
SECURE WHEN HIS IS NOT THERE.  HE WILL BE MOVING TO A NEW 
RESIDENCE TOWARD THE END OF THIS YEAR, WHICH WILL HAVE A 
LOCKED VAULT LARGE ENOUGH TO STORE THE THERMAL IMAGER AND 
ITS ACCESSORIES. HIS NEW RESIDENCE WILL BE IN CLOSE 
PROXIMITY TO HIS CURRENT ONE. WHEN THE TIME COMES, HE WILL 
BE PROVIDING POST WITH A CHANGE OF ADDRESS NOTIFICATION. 
 
¶9. IN ADDITION, MR. VAN DAM WILL BE RETURNING THE THERMAL 
IMAGER TO NEC SAN-EI INSTRUMENTS LTD. IN A FEW WEEKS TO HAVE 
THE INFRARED SENSOR REPLACED BECAUSE IT IS NOT PROJECTING 
IMAGES OF A SATISFACTORY QUALITY. 
 
¶10. CONCLUSION: POST CONDUCTED THIS POST-SHIPMENT 
VERIFICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED. POST 
CONFIRMS THAT SUBJECT PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN RE-EXPORTED OR 
RESOLD AND IT APPEARS TO BE USED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUTLINED 
CONDITIONS.  MR. VAN DAM WAS AGAIN EAGER TO MEET WITH AN 
EMBASSY OFFICIAL, VERY FORTHCOMING IN HIS PROVISION OF 
INFORMATION AND METICULOUS IN RECORD-KEEPING. HE AND HIS 
SURROUNDINGS LEFT A VERY FAVORABLE IMPRESSION.
