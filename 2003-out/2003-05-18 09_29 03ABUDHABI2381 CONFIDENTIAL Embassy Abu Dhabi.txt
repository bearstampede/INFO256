¶1.  (U) Classified by Charge D'Affaires Richard A. 
Albright, for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (C) Post delivered ref A talking points to the 
Office of MFA Assistant Undersecretary Abdullah Rashid 
Al-Nuami, who is heading a delegation to Washington 
this week to discuss Iraq reconstruction opportunities 
for the UAE.  The Consulate General also delivered the 
talking points to the Offices of Executive Chairman of 
Dubai Ports Authority, Customs, and Jebel Ali Free 
Zone Authority Sultan bin Sulayem, and Chairman of the 
Dubai Chamber of Commerce Obaid Al-Tayer -- both of 
whom are accompanying Al-Nuami to Washington. 
 
¶3.  (C) Comment:  The UAEG offered to the informal 
working group on Iraq reconstruction 5/6 to send UAE 
oil sector and banking experts to assist in the 
rebuilding of Iraq's ministries (ref B).  We will 
follow-up with Al-Nuami, Sulayem, and Al-Tayer upon 
their return from Washington, but suggest that the 
Department and ORHA engage directly with the UAE 
delegation on staffing gaps in Iraqi ministries this 
week.  End comment.
