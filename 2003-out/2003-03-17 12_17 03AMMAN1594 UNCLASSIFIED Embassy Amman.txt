EMBASSY AMMAN RECEIVED FOLLOWING LETTER ADDRESSED TO 
AMBASSADOR EDWARD GNEHM FROM DR. SALAH EDDIN AL-BASHIR, 
MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND TRADE QUOTE: I REFER TO YOUR 
LETTER JANUARY 21, 2003 REGARDING THE LATEST PROPOSAL 
CONCERNING AGRICULTURAL EXPORT CREDITS SUBMITTED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA DURING THE 
MEETINGS OF THE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE WITHIN THE 
FRAMEWORK OF THE WTO. 
 
IN THIS CONTEXT, WE BELIEVE EXPORT CREDIT PROGRAMS HAVE 
BEEN USEFUL TO MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND JORDAN IS ONE 
OF THEM.  HOWEVER, JORDAN NOW IS NOT MAKING FULL ADVANTAGE 
OF SUCH PROGRAMS DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY PRICES. 
IN THIS REGARD, I SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CONGRATULATE 
YOUR GOVERNMENT ON THE WELL BALANCED PROPOSAL REGARDING 
THIS MATTER.  UNQUOTE.  GNEHM
