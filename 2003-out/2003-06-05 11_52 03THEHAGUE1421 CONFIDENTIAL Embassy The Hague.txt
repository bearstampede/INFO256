¶1.  (U) The Dutch newspaper Trouw reported today that Al Aqsa 
Foundation has continued its operations under the auspices of 
the Israa Foundation.  Israa is an acronym for 
"internationale steun rechtstreeks aan armen" or 
"International Direct Support for the Poor."

¶3.  (C) Meanwhile one of our non-governmental contacts has 
flagged the Al Maktabah Foundation as a possible front 
organization for the Al Aqsa Foundation in the Netherlands. 
Although our contact had no firm evidence linking the two 
groups, he said that the behavior of Al Maktabah and Al Aqsa 
are similar.  For example, Al Aqsa Foundation often raised 
funds at Palestinian rallies for which it was neither the 
organizer nor the speaker.  On 5/31-6/1  Al Maktabah was 
fundraising at a Rotterdam festival at which The Dutch 
Palestine Committee was the only political organization 
authorized (in terms of actually having a permit) to 
participate.  We have no additional information linking Al 
Aqsa Foundation with Al Maktabah Foundation.  However, we 
wanted to provide Washington agencies with the particulars on 
this foundation should evidence of a link later emerge.
