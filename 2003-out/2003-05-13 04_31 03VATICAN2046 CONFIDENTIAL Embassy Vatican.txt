¶3. (C)  COMMENT:  THE TAIWAN EMBASSY WAS CLEARLY WORKING THIS 
COMMUNICATION ACTIVELY, HAVING PHONED EMBASSY POLOFF TO ALERT 
HIM BEFORE THE VATICAN CALLED.  THEY CITED THE SARS EPIDEMIC 
AS A REASON TO MOVE QUICKLY TO BRING TAIWAN INTO THE WHO. THE 
HUMANITARIAN FOCUS, TOGETHER WITH THE POTENTIAL SUPPORT OF 
THE USG AND OTHER PLAYERS, ALLOWED THE HOLY SEE IN THIS CASE 
TO VOICE ITS SUPPORT WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING FUTURE DIALOG WITH 
THE PRC ABOUT THE CHURCH'S STATUS IN CHINA. END COMMENT.
