E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/30/2013 
TAGS: PREL EAID MOPS IZ IT UNSC UN
SUBJECT: ITALIANS SURPRISED BY EXCLUSION FROM UN IRAQ GROUP 
OF FRIENDS 
 
    CLASSIFIED BY: DCM EMIL SKODON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE MFA HAS EXPRESSED ITALY'S INDIGNATION AT 
ITS EXCLUSION FROM THE RECENTLY CREATED UN IRAQ GROUP OF 
FRIENDS AND REQUESTED US ASSISTANCE IN GETTING ITALY INCLUDED 
IN THE GROUP. WE UNDERSTAND DEFENSE MINISTER MARTINO HAS MADE 
THE SAME POINT TO SECRETARY RUMSFELD AND THAT FM FRATTINI 
WILL DO THE SAME TO SECRETARY POWELL. WE HAVE ADVISED THE 
ITALIANS TO APPROACH SYG ANNAN DIRECTLY. SHOULD THE SYG 
SUPPLANT THE CURRENT SEVEN-PLUS-FIVE-PLUS-FIVE GROUP WITH A 
LARGER "FRIENDS OF IRAQ", HOWEVER, WE RECOMMEND THE USG 
SUPPORT INCLUSION OF ITALY, WHICH CAN BE COUNTED ON TO 
SUPPORT OUR APPROACH IN IRAQ. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (C) LUCA FERRARI, MFA OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR THE EASTERN 
MEDITERRANEAN, AND LUIGI MACCOTTA, MFA OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR 
THE MIDDLE EAST, BROUGHT UP THE RECENT CREATION OF THE UN 
IRAQ GROUP OF FRIENDS CONSISTING OF THE P-5, NEIGHBORING 
COUNTRIES, SELECTED UNSC MEMBERS AND OTHERS. THEY STATED THAT 
THE GROUP WAS A POSITIVE INITIATIVE BUT WERE SURPRISED AND 
OFFENDED THAT ITALY HAD NOT BEEN INCLUDED. ITALY IS THE THIRD 
LARGEST PRESENCE ON THE GROUND AND BOTH THE PEOPLE AND THE 
GOVERNMENT OF ITALY HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO THE US-LED 
EFFORT IN IRAQ. DUE TO THIS LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT AND ITS 
COMMITMENT IN IRAQ, THEY FELT ITALY SHOULD BE A MEMBER OF THE 
GROUP. 
 
¶3. (C) POL M/C TOLD FERRARI THAT THE GROUP WAS CREATED BY 
UNSYG ANNAN AND URGED ITALY TO APPROACH ANNAN DIRECTLY. 
FERRARI SAID ITALY WOULD APPROACH ANNAN, BUT BELIEVES THAT 
THE US WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN ESTABLISHING THIS INITIATIVE AND 
    SURPRISED THAT WE HAD NOT ENSURED ITALY'S INCLUSION. 
 
¶4. (C) COMMENT: WE HAVE HEARD SIMILAR PLEAS BEFORE FROM THE 
ITALIANS ABOUT THE NEED FOR THEIR SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS 
TO IRAQ TO BE DULY AND PUBLICLY RECOGNIZED. THERE IS SOME 
CREDENCE IN THE ARGUMENT THAT NOT DOING SO WILL MAKE IT 
HARDER FOR THE GOI TO JUSTIFY ITS ROLE IN IRAQ TO THE ITALIAN 
PUBLIC. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, THE PROBLEM IS EXACERBATED 
BY ITALY'S TENDENCY TO FEEL PUNCHED IN THE GUT WHENEVER IT'S 
EXCLUDED FROM A GROUP THAT INCLUDES GERMANY. WE UNDERSTAND 
THAT THE SYG'S SEVEN-PLUS-FIVE-PLUS-FIVE GROUP MAY BE 
SUPPLANTED BY A LARGER "FRIENDS OF IRAQ." SHOULD THAT HAPPEN, 
WE URGE USG SUPPORT FOR INCLUSION OF THE ITALIANS, WHO COULD 
BE COUNTED ON TO SUPPORT US PRIORITIES WITHIN THE GROUP. END 
COMMENT.
