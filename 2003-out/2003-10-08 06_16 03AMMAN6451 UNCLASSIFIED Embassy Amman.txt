FOR PM/DTCC BLUE LANTERN COORDINATOR PETER MAXWELL 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: KOMC ETTC JO
SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 2: PRE-LICENSE END USE CHECK ON 
APPLICATION 05-893416 
 
REF: SECSTATE 213213 
 
 ¶1. (U) Post Military Assistance Program office (MAP) 
personnel have inquired discreetly about the end use of the 
commando rifles for which PM/DTCC has received the subject 
license application.  We can confirm that the rifles are 
destined to Jordan's counter-terrorism (CT) forces.  Given 
that CT forces are highly trained and specialized, with each 
individual operator potentially having 5-10 weapons assigned 
to him, we do not believe that the quantity of rifles in the 
three consignments is incommensurate with the needs of the CT 
team. 
 
¶2. (U) The Special Forces counter-terrorism team comprises 
approximately 500 personnel, within an overall Special Forces 
Command of about 5,000 personnel.  In addition, Royal Guard 
forces are a separate specialized security force that 
includes approximately 2,000 soldiers.  Captain Daghistani is 
responsible for research, development, and testing of new 
weapons.  Weapons procured by the King's military office go 
to either the Royal Guard or the appropriate unit of the 
Special Forces Command.
