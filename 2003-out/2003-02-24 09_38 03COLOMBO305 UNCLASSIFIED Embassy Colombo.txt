SUBJECT: YEAR 2003 SPECIAL 301 REVIEW - INPUT FROM SRI LANKA 
 
Ref: Colombo 257 
 
Based on the government of Sri Lanka's (GSL) recent progress 
in improving IPR protection (reviewed in reftel), post 
believes that Sri Lanka should remain off the Special 301 
watch list.  While IPR protection here remains weak - as 
detailed in the International Intellectual Property 
Alliance's public comment submission - we sense a newfound 
commitment on the part of GSL to change this.  Post 
recommends that we continue use the Trade and Investment 
Framework Agreement (TIFA) process to push GSL to improve 
IPR protection and enforcement.  The TIFA is responsible for 
the recent progress here, and the TIFA remains the most 
effective tool for getting Sri Lanka where it needs to be on 
IPR.
