SUBJECT:  IRAQ GC PRESIDENT AL HAKIM DECEMBER 21 
VISIT TO ABU DHABI 
 
Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, 
Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
Ref: (A) Abu Dhabi 5132, (B) Abu Dhabi 4704, (C) 
Abu Dhabi 4010 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: Iraq Governing Council President 
Abdulaziz Al Hakim paid a brief visit to the UAE 
December 21, meeting with UAE President Shaykh 
Zayed, Deputy Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and UAE 
Armed Forces Chief, Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) and 
with Deputy Prime Minister and MinState for 
Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayed (HbZ). 
The discussions covered the situation in Iraq 
and efforts to restore security and stability 
there.  As with earlier such visits by IGC 
delegations (refs A and B), the UAEG rolled out 
the red carpet and issued a strong public 
statement in support of the interim Iraqi 
leadership.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Abu Dhabi Deputy Crown Prince and UAE 
Armed Forces Chief of Staff, LTG Shaykh Mohammed 
bin Zayed, told the Ambassador and visiting U.S. 
Air Force Chief of Staff General Jumper that 
President Zayed and Al Hakim met in an open 
majlis for 20 minutes, then held a private 
discussion.  "It was a very good meeting," he 
added.  President Zayed had emphasized to Al 
Hakim the need for good governance and pledged 
UAE's ongoing support of Iraq.  In the second, 
smaller meeting Al Hakim raised three issues: a) 
concern over transit of Al Qaida through the 
UAE; b) presence of former Baathists in the UAE; 
and c) UAE support for Iraq's reconstruction. 
MbZ told Al Hakim that the UAE actively looks 
out for Al Qaida operatives given its many 
borders and has a close cooperation with the 
USG.  On former Baathists traveling to the UAE, 
he told Al Hakim that many Iraqis along with all 
other nationalities enter the UAE freely, but if 
the CPA or GC have any serious concerns and 
evidence regarding former Baathists, the UAE 
would gladly put them on a plane for Baghdad. 
 
¶3.  (C) Deputy PM and MinState for Foreign 
Affairs Hamdan bin Zayed HbZ held meetings with 
Al Hakim both before and after Shaykh Zayed's 
meeting.  According to HbZ's staff, the 
discussions focused on the UAE's role in the 
reconstruction of Iraq and humanitarian support 
for the Iraqi people through the UAE's Red 
Crescent Society. 
 
¶4. (U) In an official statement released to the 
press, Shaykh Zayed called for the restoration 
of tranquility and stability in Iraq.  His 
statement was generally consistent with earlier 
public statements of support for the IGC by the 
UAEG (ref C), with promises that Emiratis and 
the Arab world would stand by their Iraqi 
brothers.  President Zayed underscored the 
importance of Iraqi sovereignty, and called on 
the U.S.-led coalition to hand over power to the 
Iraqis as soon as their mission is accomplished 
and security is restored.  Non-Iraqi opinion on 
the issues of stability and sovereignty are 
unacceptable, the President added.  "On these 
issues, it is only the opinion of the Iraqis 
that should reign supreme." 
 
¶5. (U) Due to the brief length of Al Hakim's 
visit, there was no time to meet with Abu 
Dhabi's Iraqi expatriate community, a fact 
confirmed by two of the Embassy's regular Iraqi 
contacts active in the expat community.
