SUBJECT:  STRENGTHENING GLOBAL SECURITY: 
          RIGHTSIZING THE IAEA SAFEGUARDS BUDGET 
 
REF: a) STATE 13752 b) 02 Abu Dhabi 6747 
 
Â¶1. The Ambassador presented ref A letter from the 
Deputy Secretary to MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan Bin 
Zayid Al-Nahyan during a 1/21 meeting with MFA 
Assistant U/S for Political Affairs Abdullah Rashid 
Al-Nuaimi.  The Ambassador laid out the reasons for 
our recommendation to upgrade the IAEA safeguards 
budget and requested that the UAEG seriously 
consider increasing their slice of the budget, 
particularly in light of the fact that the UAE 
recently signed a safeguards agreement with the 
IAEA.  Al-Nuaimi indicated that the matter would 
likely be referred to the Ministry of Electricity 
and Power, which has responsibility for IAEA-related 
issues.
