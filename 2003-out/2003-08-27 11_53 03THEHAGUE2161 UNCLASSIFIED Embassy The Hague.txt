Dear Mr. Johnson, 
 
     The United States Government has made a contribution on 
USD$ 175,000 in support of the continuation of the Rules of 
the Road project of the Tribunal.  Please be informed that 
this amount shall be subject to the thirteen (13) per cent 
programme support costs, in accordance with the United 
Nations regulations. 
 
     On behalf of the Tribunal, I would like to take this 
opportunity to express my gratitude for the continuous 
support the United States had given to the Tribunal. 
 
Yours Sincerely, 
/S/ 
Hans Holthuis 
Registrar

¶3.  Comment.  As indicated in reftel, the Rules of the Road 
program was in dire financial straits until the USG 
contribution.  Earlier in the summer the ICTY Deputy 
Prosecutor and other senior officials in the Office of the 
Prosecutor (OTP) extended their personal thanks for the USG's 
donation, without which this important program would have 
died.  The OTP is currently formulating with OHR a joint plan 
that would transition the Rules of the Road program to 
Sarajevo in order to ensure that the tremendous expertise it 
has developed will be available to the new State Court and 
contribute to the Tribunal's completion strategy.  End 
comment.
