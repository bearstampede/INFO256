¶1. (C)  EMBASSY DELIVERED REFPOINTS TO ATTILIO IANNUCCI, THE 
MFA'S DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE. 
IANNUCCI SHARED THAT THE GOI WAS "THINKING ALONG THE SAME 
LINES" AS THE USG ON PLANNING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IN THE 
EVENT OF A WAR WITH IRAQ.  IANNUCCI SAID THAT ITALY IS 
ALREADY WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE IOM, ICRC AND WFP. 
FURTHERMORE, THE GOI IS PREPARED "TO TAKE DECISIONS WITHIN 
HOURS" AS TO WHAT SPECIFIC CONTINGENCIES WOULD REQUIRE 
ITALIAN EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE AND THROUGH WHICH INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS SUCH ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE DELIVERED.  IANNUCCI 
WAS NOT ABLE TO QUANTIFY THE GOI'S COMMITMENT, BUT DREW A 
PARALLEL TO AFGHANISTAN, WHERE ITALY, AFTER INITIALLY 
STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE AT THE TOKYO DONOR'S CONFERENCE, 
WOUND UP EXCEEDING ITS PLEDGE OF EUROS 47.3 MILLION FOR THE 
YEAR (REF B).
