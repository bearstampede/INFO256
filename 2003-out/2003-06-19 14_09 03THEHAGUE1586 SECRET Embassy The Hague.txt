Classified By: A/DCM JESS BAILY FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1.     (S)  EconOff delivered demarche ref A to Jan Peter 
Kleiweg and Wouter Juergens of the Netherlands Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs on June 19.  The MFA was already aware of the 
U.S. intent to postpone the designation of the Hamas leaders 
and linked NGOs prior to the demarche being delivered. 
 
¶2.     (S) Kleiweg commented that the Netherlands hopes the 
European Council meeting in Thessaloniki will produce a 
political decision, which in turn will enable the EU to move 
forward on designation.  The Dutch Prime Minister is carrying 
talking points to the meeting that reflect a firm position on 
Hamas and include elements of the recent U.S. demarche (ref 
B).  The MFA noted their support for the fact that the 
subject of Hamas will be discussed at the June 20 meeting of 
the EU clearinghouse in Brussels.
