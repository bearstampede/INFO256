SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. WFP'S EXECUTIVE BOARD APPROVED ON FEBRUARY 7 THE 
AFGHANISTAN PROTRACTED RELIEF AND RECOVERY OPERATION (PRRO) 
ENTITLED FOOD ASSISTANCE TO RE-ESTABLISH LIVELIHOODS AND 
HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY IN AFGHANISTAN. THE PRRO WILL BE 
OPERATIONAL FOR TWO YEARS (APRIL 1, 2003-END MARCH 2005), 
COVERING 6.0 MILLION BENEFICIARIES IN YEAR ONE AND 5.27 
MILLION IN YEAR TWO. THE TOTAL COST TO WFP IS U.S. DOLLARS 
337.5 MILLION, WITH A TOTAL FOOD REQUIREMENT OF 618,989 
METRIC TONS. THE CHALLENGE FOR THE NEW PRRO IS SECURITY. 
WITHOUT CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE SECURITY SITUATION 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WFP WILL BE CONFINED TO ASSISTING 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

U.S. INTERVENTION 
----------------- 
 
¶2. USAID/DAA/DCHA GARRETT GRIGSBY DELIVERED THE U.S. 
INTERVENTION TO THE WFP EXECUTIVE BOARD ON FEBRUARY 6 AND 
HIGHLIGHTED THE FOLLOWING: 
 
-THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN, THE UNITED NATIONS, NON- 
GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND AFGHAN COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN 
IMMENSELY INVOLVED IN RESPONDING TO THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, 
ADDRESSING CRITICAL NEEDS. THE FOCUS HAS NOW SHIFTED TO A 
MULTIFACETED RESPONSE TO REBUILDING COMMUNITIES, RESPONDING 
TO THE MANY COMPONENTS OF FOOD INSECURITY, CREATING JOBS, 
IMPROVING EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE AND EXPANDING SOCIAL 
SERVICES; 
 
-SINCE OCTOBER 2001, THE UNITED STATES HAS MADE AVAILABLE 
CLOSE TO U.S. DOLLARS 600 MILLION IN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 
TO AFGHANISTAN, MUCH OF WHICH HAS BEEN TARGETED TO WOMEN AND 
CHILDREN. AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO STANDING SHOULDER TO 
SHOULDER WITH THE AFGHAN PEOPLE AS THEY REBUILD THEIR 
COUNTRY AND GET BACK ON THEIR FEET AGAIN; 
 
-THE UNITED STATES SUPPORTS THE FULL PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN 
IN THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE OF AFGHANISTAN 
AND SEES WFP'S FOOD-FOR-EDUCATION INTERVENTION AS A VITAL 
PART OF THE LONG-TERM EFFORT TO ACHIEVE THIS. ON THE ISSUE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  00644  01 OF 02  181040Z 
OF FOOD ASSISTANCE FOR TEACHER SALARY SUPPLEMENTS, ARE OTHER 
INTERVENTIONS ENVISIONED TO IMPROVE TEACHERS' SALARIES AND 
THUS OBVIATE THE NEED FOR FOOD RATIONS AT SOME POINT IN THE 
FUTURE? 
 
-THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT BENEFICIARY GROUPS ARE BEING 
CONSULTED ON THE FOOD AID ACTIVITIES IMPACTING THEM.  THIS 
IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN FOOD-FOR-WORK OR FOOD-FOR-ASSET 
CREATION. THE ROLE OF BENEFICIARIES IN PLANNING AND 
IMPLEMENTING FOOD AID SHOULD BE A PROGRAM FIXTURE; 
 
-THE PROPOSED LTSH (LANDSIDE TRANSPORT, STORAGE AND 
HANDLING) RATE NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED AGAINST ACTUALS AND 
ADJUSTED AS APPROPRIATE. AS GIVEN, THE FIGURE OF U.S. 
DOLLARS 126.82/METRIC TON SEEMS DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH. WE 
WOULD ALSO LIKE ASSURANCES THAT THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED 
WITH TRUCKING CHARGES IN HERAT IN LATE 2001-EARLY 2002 HAVE 
BEEN SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED;

SUBJECT:  APPROVAL OF AFGHANISTAN PROTRACTED RELIEF AND

-THE U.S. APPRECIATES THE JOINT EFFORTS OF BOTH WFP AND FAO 
TO ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE FOOD SECURITY AND INFORMATION 
SYSTEM IN AFGHANISTAN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MINISTRY OF 
AGRICULTURE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND THE MINISTRY OF 
RECONSTRUCTION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT. THE AVAILABILITY OF 
TIMELY PREDICTIONS OF FOOD SHORTAGES AND INFORMATION ABOUT 
AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES AND THE FOOD SECURITY SITUATION OF 
RURAL HOUSEHOLDS WILL GREATLY ASSIST IN IMPROVING FOOD 
SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY; 
 
-A RECENT USAID-FUNDED ASSESSMENT RECOMMENDS AGAINST SUCH 
LOCAL PURCHASES OF WHEAT WITHIN AFGHANISTAN AT THE PRESENT 
TIME, ARGUING THAT PURCHASES WOULD NOT PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE 
BENEFIT TO PRODUCERS AND SERVES TO DISRUPT MARKETS; 
 
-ULTIMATELY THE RETURN OF REFUGEES AND ENDING THE

THE EMPLACEMENT OF A UNIFIED AND EFFECTIVE SECURITY 
STRUCTURE. THIS WILL REQUIRE CONTINUOUS MONITORING. 
 
¶3. ON THE MARGINS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, USDEL HIGHLIGHTED 
THE IMPORTANCE OF WFP AREA OFFICES OPPORTUNELY TRANSMITTING 
MONTHLY FOOD ALLOTMENTS TO THEIR NGO PARTNERS FOR PLANNING 
PURPOSES AND COMMUNICATING ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE 
BENEFICIARIES. USDEL ALSO STRESSED IMPROVED REPORTING 
RELATED TO ACTUAL DISTRIBUTIONS (TONNAGE AND BENEFICIARY 
NUMBERS) AS COMPARED WITH PLANNED DISTRIBUTION ALLOCATIONS.

OTHER INTERVENTIONS 
------------------- 
 
¶4. GERMANY COMMENTED THAT THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT HAS TO DO A 
BETTER JOB IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF TEACHER WAGES AND 
PAYMENT OF ADEQUATE SALARIES IN CASH IN LIEU OF KIND. IRAN 
WAS MOST SUPPORTIVE OF WFP'S EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN AND 
ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOI WAS GRANTING 1,700 SCHOLARSHIPS FOR 
AFGHAN YOUTHS TO STUDY IN IRAN. BOTH THE AFGHAN DELEGATE AND 
THE NETHERLANDS WARNED OF THE DANGER THAT FOOD AID (IN MORE 
THAN MODEST QUANTITIES) CAN DEPRESS PRICES AND LOWER 
EARNINGS FOR LOCAL FARMERS. 
 
¶5. THE NETHERLANDS COMMENTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF 
AFGHANISTAN IS ENCOURAGING CASH-FOR-WORK, BASED ON THE 
PREMISE THAT AFGHANISTAN HAS REACHED A SITUATION WHERE CASH 
CAN BUY WHAT PEOPLE NEED AND THAT CASH WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR 
CASH-FOR-WORK PROGRAMS. THE WFP SECRETARIAT RESPONDED THAT 
BOTH FOOD-FOR-WORK AND CASH-FOR-WORK HAVE PROVEN EFFECTIVE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  00644  02 OF 02  181040Z 
IN ENDING POVERTY AND HELPING COMMUNITIES TO REBUILD LOST 
ASSETS - AND THAT PERHAPS THE BEST APPROACH IS A MIX OF CASH 
AND FOOD ADAPTED TO LOCAL NEEDS.

COMMENT

¶6. WFP'S CURRENT EMERGENCY OPERATION (EMOP), DUE TO END 
MARCH 31, 2003, IS 83 PERCENT FUNDED (U.S. DOLLARS 240.3 
MILLION). TWENTY-THREE DONORS HAVE RESPONDED TO DATE. THIS 
STRONG MANIFESTATION OF MULTI-DONOR SUPPORT IS, IN THE 
BOARD'S VIEW, A TELLING ENDORSEMENT THAT WFP HAS PERFORMED 
EFFECTIVELY. THE CHALLENGE FOR THE NEW PRRO IS SECURITY. 
WITHOUT CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE SECURITY SITUATION 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WFP WILL BE CONFINED TO ASSISTING 
PRIMARILY BY SAVING LIVES WHEN THE NEEDS NOW ARE FOR 
RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION. HALL
