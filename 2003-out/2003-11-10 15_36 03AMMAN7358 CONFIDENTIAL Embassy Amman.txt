SUBJECT: JORDANIAN MFA AGAIN ASKS FOR ACCOUNTING OF 
JORDANIAN DETAINEES IN IRAQ 
 
REF: AMMAN 5663 
 
Classified By: DCM David M. Hale for reasons 1.5 (b) (d) 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request for the Department. 
Please see para 4 below. 
 
¶2.  (C)  During a conversation November 9 on other topics 
(septel, notal), Ali al-Ayed, Director of Foreign Minister 
Marwan Muasher's Private Office, asked PolCouns for the 
status of the USG response to the formal Jordanian request 
for an accounting of Jordanian detainees in coalition custody 
in Iraq (ref).  Ayed pointed out that the request had been 
sent in late August but, 10 weeks later, there had been no 
response.  Ayed noted that the Jordanian government has been 
contacted by 37 Jordanian families who believe that they have 
Jordanian citizen relatives in coalition detention in Iraq. 
The MFA has been referring the families to the ICRC, which, 
according to Ayed, has been unable to provide the families 
information on any of the cases.  (Subsequently, the MFA 
informed Jordan's official press agency that it had presented 
the Embassy a list of the missing.  Embassy has received no 
such list.) 
 
¶3.  (C)  ACTION REQUEST:  Please advise how the Embassy 
should respond to this MFA second request. 
 
¶4.  (U)  CPA Baghdad minimize considered.
