SUBJECT: REFUGEE SITUATION IN NEPAL: CANADA SHARES CONCERN 
 
REF: STATE 36386 
 
¶1. (SBU) We presented reftel demarche February 10 to Elissa 
Golberg, Policy Advisor for Humanitarian Affairs in DFAIT's 
Human Rights, Humanitarian Affairs and International Women's 
Equality Division. She stated that Canada shares our concern 
over the lack of progress in solving the refugee situation in 
eastern Nepal. Ms. Golberg said Canada's ambassador at its 
U.N. mission in Geneva will be meeting soon with the 
Bhutanese ambassador, and in that meeting he will stress the 
same points set out in our demarche. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ms. Golberg indicated that some Bhutanese refugees 
have been resettled in Canada, under the private  sponsorship 
of Canadian NGOs and local community groups.  She said the 
GOC has not yet considered new offers of resettlement to 
others, nor has it discussed providing financial assistance 
for those refugees who return to Bhutan.
