Â¶1.  (C)  PolCouns and Italian DCM Nicola Lener (representing 
the EU presidency) jointly delivered ref points on the EU 
draft UNGA resolution on human rights in Turkmenistan to 
Ayman Aamiri, Acting Director of the International 
Organizations Directorate of the MFA on November 20.  Lener 
and PolCouns asked that Jordan support the draft resolution. 
Aamiri, who was familiar with the resolution, commented that 
Jordan usually followed the Islamic Conference bloc vote in 
matters pertaining to OIC members, but sometimes made 
exceptions.  He noted that the government of Turkmenistan had 
communicated with Jordan's non-resident Embassy in Tashkent 
that it had felt "surprised and taken aback" by the draft and 
had been "trying to cooperate" with the UN and EU on human 
rights issues.  Aamiri said he would bring the U.S.-EU 
demarche to the attention of Foreign Minister Muasher and 
Jordan's UN Mission in New York.
