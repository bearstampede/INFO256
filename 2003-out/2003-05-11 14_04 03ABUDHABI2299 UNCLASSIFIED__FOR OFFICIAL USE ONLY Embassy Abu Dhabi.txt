SUBJECT: ABU DHABI'S EXPORTS REMAIN A ONE-TRICK PONY 
(OIL) 
 
(SBU) According to official figures, Abu Dhabi exports 
in the first quarter of 2003 totaled approximately 2 
billion USD, less than 10% of which was non oil- 
related. The Customs Department report shows that Abu 
Dhabi's oil exports continue to be the main engine of 
the economy, in sharp contrast to better diversified 
Dubai, where non-oil exports heavily exceed petroleum 
sector revenues. Total Abu Dhabi non-oil exports for 
the quarter were 96 million USD and re-exports 107 
million USD.  [Although we would hope that these 
figures are accurate, there is a tendency here to 
assign exaggerated valuations to the latter.] High oil 
prices in the first quarter of 2003 also resulted in 
greater income for Abu Dhabi, which no doubt inflated 
the difference in comparison to the non-oil sector, 
but the difference with regard to Dubai still remains 
stark.
