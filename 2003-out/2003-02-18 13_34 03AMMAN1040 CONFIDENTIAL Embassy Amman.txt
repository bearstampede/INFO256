Â¶1.  (C)  PolCouns February 16 presented Ali al-Ayed, personal 
assistant to Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher, with a copy of 
the Secretary's February 14 address before the UNSC on Iraq. 
Ayed said he had called up a text of the Secretary's speech 
from the Department web site and had already read it.  Ayed 
commented that Jordanian UN PermRep Prince Zaid bin Raad 
would address the February 18 debate on Iraq, although he did 
not know precisely what Prince Zaid would say.  PolCouns 
suggested that Prince Zaid's remarks should focus on Iraq's 
failure to implement numerous UNSCRs over the past 12 years.
