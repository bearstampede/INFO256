SUBJECT: NIGERIA: UWECHUE SAYS GON WILL CONSIDER 
INVOLVEMENT IN CDI FORCE AFTER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 
 
 
 CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER FOR REASONS 1.5 
(B) AND (D). 
 
 
¶1.  (C) During a January 9 meeting with Ambassador Jeter, 
Nigerian Special Presidential Envoy on Conflict Resolution 
Ambassador Raph Uwechue discussed the evolving crisis in 
Cote d'Ivoire and the possibility of Nigerian involvement 
in the ECOWAS peacekeeping force deploying to the country. 
 
 
¶2.  (C) Uwechue said the GON was unlikely to consider 
participation in the ECOWAS force until after Nigeria's 
April presidential elections.  Uwechue added that President 
Obasanjo would have more time to focus on Cote d'Ivoire now 
that he has won the PDP nomination and feels comfortable 
about winning the general election. 
 
 
¶3.  (C) Noting that Nigeria had been noticeably "missing in 
action" during much of the Ivoirien crisis and peace 
negotiations, Ambassador said that even if Nigeria could 
not participate in the ECOWAS peacekeeping force, it should 
lend its weight to find a diplomatic and political solution 
to the crisis.  Uwechue agreed whole-heartedly and asked 
the Ambassador to carry this message to President Obasanjo. 
 
 
¶4.  (C) COMMENT: Subsequent to the meeting with Uwechue, 
who is a seasoned and sophisticated diplomat, Ambassador 
has discussed with President Obasanjo the need for greater 
Nigerian diplomatic engagement on Cote d'Ivoire.  From what 
we have seen of Nigerian efforts in the past few weeks, our 
entreaty seems to be paying off.  END COMMENT.
