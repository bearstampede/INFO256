SUBJECT: MESSAGE FROM SECRETARY POWELL 
 
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH HAS ARRIVED, AND MILITARY OPERATIONS 
TO DISARM IRAQ HAVE BEGUN. MORE THAN 30 NATIONS HAVE 
JOINED WITH THE UNITED STATES TO FREE THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND 
DEFEND THE WORLD FROM THE GRAVE DANGER POSED BY IRAQ'S 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. 
 
AT THIS TIME OF TRIAL AND DANGER, I WANT TO COMMEND AND 
THANK EVERY MEMBER OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT FAMILY. EACH 
DAY, YOU SERVE OUR COUNTRY WITH PRIDE, COURAGE, AND 
SACRIFICE. IN THE DAYS AHEAD, I KNOW I CAN COUNT ON YOUR 
CONTINUED DEDICATION AND DEVOTION TO COUNTRY. 
 
FOR THOSE OF OUR STATE DEPARTMENT FAMILY WHO HAVE BEEN 
CALLED UP TO SERVE WITH THE MILITARY, WE HOPE AND PRAY 
THAT YOU WILL RETURN SAFELY TO YOUR LOVED ONES AND TO YOUR 
COLLEAGUES IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT. 
 
Â¶2. MINIMIZED CONSIDERED. 
 
 
POWELL
