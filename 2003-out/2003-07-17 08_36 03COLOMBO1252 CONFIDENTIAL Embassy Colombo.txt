SIPDIS 
issue MFA had raised before (reftels) of status of Iraqi 
Embassy in Colombo.   He had heard from Sri Lankan Ambassador 
in Baghdad that Iraqi Ambassador in Colombo was part of the 
problem, and that Iraqi Embassy operations here would be 
suspended.  He said he hoped that, pending reopening, there 
could either be a protective power here to represent Iraqi 
interests, or that the Iraqi Ambassador in Delhi would be 
accredited to Colombo as well.  He again cited the 
significant economic interest the GSL has in its tea trade 
with Iraq (at the pre-war high point, Iraq took 61 percent of 
Sri Lanka,s tea exports). 
 
¶2.  (C) Charge said we were inquiring of Washington about 
the longer-term status of the Iraqi mission in Colombo and 
would get back to him on that.   He assured Rodrigo that we 
had no objection to issuance of visas to the two Iraqi 
diplomats in New Delhi seeking entry to Colombo 
 
¶3.  (C) Request Department clarify status of Iraqi 
Embassy closure/suspension here, and comment, if possible, on 
FonSec,s alternative options.
