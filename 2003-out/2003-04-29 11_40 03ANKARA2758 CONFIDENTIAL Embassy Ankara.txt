SUBJECT: IRAQ/STABILIZATION: TURKS PRESS FOR GOT 
CONTRIBUTION TO UK MULTINATIONAL DIVISION 
 
REF: ANKARA 2553 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  Classified by Ambassador Robert Pearson.  Reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
¶2.  (C)  During an informal breakfast meeting on April 27 
with visiting Congressman Robert Wexler (D-FL), MFA D/US 
Ilkin raised the GOT's wish to play a role in any 
stabilization force in Iraq.  Ilkin told the Congressman that 
the US may have "misunderstood" Turkey's request to 
contribute to the stabilization force, thinking that Turkey's 
decision was contingent on external funding.  Ilkin 
emphasized that Turkey wants to contribute even if it has to 
pay its own way.  He went on to say that Turkish troops did 
not have to be situated in the north and that the GOT would 
be happy if they were assigned to Baghdad. 
 
 
¶3.    (C)  In a separate earlier conversation, Ilkin had 
telephoned Ambassador on April 25 to say that the GOT had 
again heard that the UK was holding a conference April 30 - 
May 1 to form two multinational divisions.  Indicating 
Turkey's interest in participating, Ilkin said the GOT had 
already approached the British on this matter.  Ilkin said 
Ankara was holding up its phase IV offer (including the 
stabilization force) until it heard back from Washington with 
regard to questions Ankara had raised about the March 26 list 
of competencies that was distributed to coalition members in 
Washington.  Ambassador reminded Ilkin that no neighboring 
states had been invited to the UK-led multinational division 
meeting and that the USG March 26 stabilization list of 
competencies is a separate matter.  Ilkin then asserted that 
the British could not have organized the London multinational 
division meeting without US help, implying that Washington 
should exert influence in attaining a Turkish role under 
British command. 
 
 
¶4.  (C)  Following his conversation with Ilkin, Ambassador 
spoke with UK Ambassador Westmacott and agreed that the 
British would deal with the Turkish request on their own and 
determine any appropriate Turkish participation. 
 
 
¶5.  (U)  Congressman Wexler has not cleared this cable.
