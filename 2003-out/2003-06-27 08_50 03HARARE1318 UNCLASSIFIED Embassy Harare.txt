SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION POWELL ON ZIM CRISIS; HARARE 
 
  ¶1.   Under headline "Ball in your court" the independent 
      daily "The Daily News" dedicated its June 26 
      editorial to encouraging Robert Mugabe's government 
      to embrace Secretary Colin Powell's recommendations, 
      carried in an op-ed published in the New York Times, 
      in support of a recovery program for the country's 
      ragged economy.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .Zimbabweans. . .must not allow Mugabe and 
      ZANU PF to sacrifice on the alter of ego the latest 
      opportunity offered by America to pull Zimbabwe out 
      of crisis.  United States Secretary of State Colin 
      Powell, writing in the `New York Times' newspaper 
      this week, vouched generous economic aid for 
      Zimbabwe if ZANU PF and the MDC seriously engaged in 
      dialogue that would lead to peaceful, transparent 
      and democratic elections to choose a new government. 
      Powell promised that aid would even start flowing to 
      Zimbabwe even before fresh elections were held, as 
      long as the transition to democracy was irreversibly 
      set in motion. . .It would be a terrible betrayal to 
      posterity if Zimbabweans allowed a government, whose 
      time has - as Powell correctly puts it - come and 
      long gone, to once more sabotage the future of this 
      country by letting the offer of help being extended 
      by the U. S. with the backing of the rest of the 
      international community, slip away.  The ball is in 
      your court, Zimbabweans."
