REF: A. ROME 1754 
     ¶B. ROME 1618 
     ¶C. ROME 1731 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL-MINISTER COUNSELOR TOM COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  EMBASSY ROME WANTS TO EXPRESS ITS APPRECIATION TO 
ALL THOSE IN THE FIELD-- ESPECIALLY AT CENTCOM--WHO ARE 
ASSISTING THE GOI DEPLOY ITS RED CROSS HOSPITAL TO IRAQ.  WE 
UNDERSTAND ALL TOO WELL THAT UNTIL APRIL 24 THE TWO-WAY 
COMMUNICATION FLOW IN TAMPA DID NOT WORK AS IT SHOULD HAVE, 
BUT ARE PLEASED THAT THE DEPLOYMENT IS NOW IN TRAIN. 
SENSITIVITY TO OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE LINKAGE BETWEEN GIVING 
THE GREEN LIGHT TO THE HOSPITAL AND THE GOI'S ABILITY TO PUSH 
FORWARD ITS PHASE IV CONTRIBUTIONS WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED 
HERE. 
 
¶2.  (C) WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE FIRST ELEMENTS OF THE 100-BED 
HOSPITAL (REF A)--INCLUDING FIRST AID AND SURGERY 
UNITS--ARRIVED IN KUWAIT CITY ON APRIL 29 AND WILL EVENTUALLY 
BE TRANSPORTED OVERLAND TO BAGHDAD.  THE HOSPITAL, WHICH WILL 
BE ABLE TO HANDLE AN ADDITIONAL 400 OUTPATIENT VISITORS 
DAILY, WILL BE SUPPORTED INITIALLY BY FIFTEEN MEDICAL 
PERSONNEL AND FIFTEEN CARABINIERI TO PROVIDE SECURITY.  WE 
EXPECT ANOTHER FIFTEEN CARBS TO FOLLOW ONCE THE FACILITY IS 
FULLY OPERATIONAL.  THE BULK OF THE HOSPITAL WILL BE 
TRANSPORTED VIA SEA WITH A SHIP SCHEDULED TO DEPART THE PORT 
OF LA SPEZIA ON MAY 3 AND ARRIVE IN AQABA, JORDAN ON OR ABOUT 
MAY 9.  THE GOI PLANS TO TRANSPORT THESE ELEMENTS FROM AQABA 
    TO BAGHDAD OVERLAND. COUNSELOR GIAN LUDOVICO DE MARTINO 
OPENED AN ITALY INTERESTS SECTION IN BAGHDAD ON APRIL 24, 
PAVING THE WAY FOR THE APRIL 27 ARRIVAL OF THE FULL-TIME 
ORHA-LIAISON, ANTONIO ARMELLINI, WHO HAS ALREADY MET WITH 
GEN. GARNER.  NEVERTHELESS, WE WILL URGE THE GOI TO KEEP UP 
THE GOOD WORK THROUGH THE LNO (GEN. SANTINI) TO ENSURE THAT 
ALL THE OPERATIONAL DETAILS OF MOVING THE FACILITY'S PIECES 
FALL INTO PLACE.  ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT, FINALLY, THEY 
WILL DO SO. 
 
¶3. (SBU) WE NOTED IN REF B THAT SITING A FIELD HOSPITAL IN 
BETWEEN THE AL NOUMAN GENERAL HOSPITAL AND THE KHEDIMIA 
PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL (NEAR SADDAM CITY) OPENS THE WAY FOR ITALY 
TO REESTABLISH A LONG-TERM "SPONSORING" RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 
TWO PERMANENT FACILITIES.   FM FRATTINI HAS NOW SIGNED AN 
AGREEMENT WITH ITALY'S RED CROSS COMMISSIONER THAT COMMITS 
THE GOI TO WORK TOWARDS A RAPID RETURN TO FULL FUNCTIONALITY 
OF THE TWO HOSPITALS.  THIS INCLUDES DISTRIBUTING MEDICINE, 
ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSIONER. 
 
¶4.  (C) OUR UK CONTACTS REPORT THAT THEIR PHASE IV 
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ITALIAN MILITARY STAFF ARE GOING WELL. 
ITALY IS COMMITTED TO STANDING UP A FORCE OF UP TO 2000 ARMY 
TROOPS PLUS 400-500 CARABINIERI IN THE BRITISH SECTOR.  THE 
DEPLOYMENT PROBABLY WILL NOT TAKE PLACE BEFORE LATE JUNE, 
ACCORDING TO THE BRITS, WITH THE EXACT LOCATION STILL TO BE 
DETERMINED. 
 
¶5.  (C) UNDERSECRETARY TO THE PM GIANNI LETTA REPORTEDLY TOLD 
DEPARTING UK AMBASSADOR SHEPERD THAT NO FURTHER AUTHORIZATION 
FOR THE DEPLOYMENT WOULD BE REQUIRED.  LETTA HAD SENT A 
    LETTER TO THE PRESIDENTS OF THE HOUSE OF DEPUTIES AND THE 
SENATE NOTIFYING THEM OF THE INITIAL CARABINIERI DETACHMENT 
SLATED TO PROVIDE FORCE PROTECTION FOR THE FIELD HOSPITAL. 
HE RECEIVED AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE FROM THE TWO PRESIDENTS 
INDICATING THAT THE PARLIAMENT HAD GRANTED ALL NECESSARY 
AUTHORIZATION FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF MILITARY PERSONNEL "TO 
HELP CREATE CONDITIONS FOR HUMANITARIAN AID" WHEN IT APPROVED 
THE GOI'S MOTION ON APRIL 15 (REF C). PER REF C, THE GOI MAY 
STILL NEED TO SEEK FUNDING FOR THE DEPLOYMENT, BUT WE DO NOT 
FORESEE ANY PROBLEMS ON THAT FRONT.   WE EXPECT BERLUSONI 
WILL BE DISCUSSING UK-ITALY PHASE IV COOPERATION DURING HIS 
DINNER WITH PM BLAIR ON APRIL 30.
