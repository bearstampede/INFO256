--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶3. ON AUGUST 24, THE MAOISTS ISSUED AN ULTIMATUM GIVING 
THE GON UNTIL AUGUST 26 TO AGREE TO THE FORMATION OF A 
CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY TO REDRAFT NEPAL'S CONSTITUTION.  THE 
ULTIMATUM FOLLOWED LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER THE CONCLUSION 
ON AUGUST 19 OF THE THIRD ROUND OF PEACE TALKS AND A DAY 
AFTER GON NEGOTIATOR AND FINANCE MINISTER, PRAKASH CHANDRA 
LOHANI, CALLED THE MAOIST DEMAND FOR A CONSTITUENT 
ASSEMBLY "A STRATEGY TO CONSOLIDATE MILITANT POWER" THAT 
COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED UNLESS THE MAOISTS AGREED TO GIVE 
UP THEIR ARMS. 
 
¶4. MAOIST STATEMENTS MADE PRIOR TO THE AUGUST 24 ULTIMATUM 
SENT MIXED MESSAGES ABOUT THE INSURGENTS' COMMITMENT TO 
THE CEASE-FIRE.  ON AUGUST 23, MAOIST SUPREME LEADER 
PUSHPA KAMAL DAHAL, ALIAS PRACHANDA, REPORTEDLY SAID THAT 
THE MAOISTS WOULD NOT "BACK AWAY" FROM THE CEASE-FIRE, 
WHILE ON AUGUST 24, MAOIST POLITICAL LEADER BABURAM 
BHATTARAI WARNED THAT ANOTHER ROUND OF TALKS WOULD BE 
"FUTILE IF THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ACCEPT UNCONDITIONALLY 
A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY."  MEANWHILE, GON NEGOTIATORS SAID 
THEY WERE READY TO RESUME PEACE TALKS "ANYTIME AFTER 
MONDAY, ANYWHERE IN NEPAL." 
 
¶5. LEADERS IN BOTH THE NEPALI CONGRESS AND COMMUNIST PARTY 
OF NEPAL - UNITED MARXIST LENINIST (CPN-UML) ALSO REJECTED 
THE MAOIST DEMAND FOR A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, ALTHOUGH 
THEY REMAINED IN FAVOR OF AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION.  CPN- 
UML LEADER K.P. OLI SAID, "THE GOVERNMENT OFFER ON THIS IS 
A GOOD ONE AND SOMETHING WHICH THE REBELS SHOULD AGREE 
TO."

DEATH OF 17 MAOISTS RAISES INTERNATIONAL CONCERN 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶6. ON AUGUST 23, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL ALLEGED THAT "17 
MAOISTS WERE DELIBERATELY KILLED BY THE ARMY AFTER BEING 
TAKEN INTO CUSTODY" AND DEMANDED A PROBE INTO THE 
INCIDENT, WHICH TOOK PLACE ON AUGUST 17 IN DORAMBA IN 
RAMECHHAP DISTRICT IN CENTRAL-EASTERN NEPAL.  THE ROYAL 
NEPAL ARMY REPORT, HOWEVER, STATED THAT THE SECURITY 
FORCES WERE ATTACKED FIRST AND ONLY RESPONDED IN SELF- 
DEFENSE. 
 
¶7. IN REACTION TO THE DORAMBA INCIDENT, THE MAOISTS 
DECLARED A BANDH, OR GENERAL STRIKE, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT

POLITICAL PARTY PROGRAM (REF E).  NO ONE WAS HURT, 
ALTHOUGH HIS VEHICLE REPORTEDLY WAS HIT TWICE BY BULLETS, 
PUNCTURING ONE TIRE.  A POLICE ESCORT VEHICLE WAS ALSO 
HIT.  PRIME MINISTER SURYA BAHADUR THAPA STRONGLY 
CONDEMNED THE ATTACK ON THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER AND SAID 
IT "RAISED SERIOUS DOUBTS OVER THE MAOISTS' COMMITMENT TO 
THE PEACE PROCESS."  ALL OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES ALSO 
MADE STATEMENTS DEPLORING THE MAOIST ATTACK.  ON AUGUST 
26, THE MAOISTS EXPRESSED "SORROW" OVER THE ATTACK ON 
DEUBA AND SUGGESTED THAT THE INSURGENTS WERE NOT AWARE 
THAT THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER WAS IN THE CONVOY.

¶11. THE GON RESPONDED TO THE INCIDENTS BY RE-DECLARING THE 
MAOISTS AS TERRORISTS -- A DESIGNATION THE GOVERNMENT 
WITHDREW AS A PRE-CONDITION TO PEACE TALKS DURING THE 
CEASE-FIRE.  SECURITY FORCES WENT ON HIGH ALERT WITH 
NIGHTTIME CURFEWS IMPOSED IN TEN DISTRICTS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY AS OF AUGUST 29. 
 
¶12. THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
WIDELY CONDEMNED THE MAOIST DECISION TO BREAK THE CEASE- 
FIRE.  NEPALI CONGRESS PRESIDENT G.P. KOIRALA URGED BOTH 
SIDES TO SEEK A PEACEFUL SOLUTION THROUGH TALKS WHILE 
NEPALI CONGRESS (DEMOCRATIC) LEADER SHER BAHADUR DEUBA 
CHARACTERIZED THE MAOIST WITHDRAWAL AS A "BETRAYAL." 
 
¶13. ON AUGUST 29, THE MAOISTS ISSUED A PRESS STATEMENT 
DECLARING THAT THE INSURGENTS WOULD RESUME GUERILLA 
WARFARE AND CONDEMNING THE "ARROGANT HINDU MONARCHY" FOR 
"SUBJUGATING" THE PEOPLE OF NEPAL.  "THAT IS WHY THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF A REPUBLIC AND A NEW NATIONAL ARMY HAS 
BECOME NECESSARY," IT ASSERTED.  THE MAOISTS AGAIN 
CRITICIZED THE U.S. - NEPAL ANTI-TERRORIST AGREEMENT AND 
THE "ARRIVAL OF HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN MILITARY ADVISORS AND 
SUPPLY OF WEAPONS WORTH BILLIONS OF RUPEES."  THE 
INSURGENTS ALSO CALLED FOR A NATION-WIDE BANDH TO CLOSE 
SCHOOLS, BUSINESSES AND TRANSPORTATION FROM SEPTEMBER 18-
