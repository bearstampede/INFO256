REF: AMMAN 1622 
 
¶1.  According to UNHCR Emergency Coordinator Carlos 
Maldonado, UNHCR today began erecting tents at the refugee 
camp at Ruweished (also identified on USG maps as Ruwayshid 
or H-4).  Poor weather conditions (rain & sandstorms) are 
hindering UNHCR's efforts, but Maldonado reports that the 
camp is ready to receive limited population flows.  All 
necessary water/sanitation infrastructure is now in place. 
UNHCR will be ready to receive its anticipated initial influx 
of 5,000 refugees within the next 72 hours. 
 
¶2.  UNHCR has a team of monitors at the Jordan-Iraq border. 
The monitors report that no Iraqi refugees have approached 
the border, but that two carloads of Sudanese nationals 
entered Jordan today. The Sudanese nationals reportedly had 
arranged their evacuation from Iraq with the Sudanese embassy 
in Jordan, and were given authorization by the GOJ to pass 
directly to Amman.  No other TCN movements were reported.
