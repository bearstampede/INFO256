SUBJECT:  UAE WOMEN'S GROUP COLLECTS MONEY FOR PALESTINAINS 
 
 
Classified by DCM Richard Albright for reasons 1.5 (b & d). 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econchief attended a charity Iftar "take 
away" hosted by an Abu Dhabi women's group in his 
neighborhood.  Members of the group cooked 
traditional Iftar foods and sweets and sold them at 
a member's house.  Customers could buy the homemade 
delicacies, reheat them and have them for Iftar 
(the breaking of the fast during Ramadan).  The 
international women's group (including Iraqis, 
Emiriatis, Palestinians, and Americans) also hosts 
a Christmas bake sale.  The purpose of the sales is 
to raise money to provide aid to the Palestinians. 
In the words of one member, "the need there is so 
great," that the group wants to help. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The group collects the money but then 
turns it over to the UAE Red Crescent Authority 
(RCA) to administer.  Using the RCA has two 
advantages.  One, it allows the women to contribute 
to a defined project - currently a dental clinic. 
The group doesn't need to "adopt" a complete 
project, but can take a share of it.  Two, it 
provides assurances that the money is going to help 
the needy.  The RCA provides feedback to the group, 
including giving them receipts and providing them 
pictures of "their project." 
 
¶3. (C) Comment:  In the post-September 11 world, 
the UAEG has acted to control the international 
activities of charities.  There is an 
"understanding" that all charitable organizations 
in the UAE must channel their international 
assistance through one of two semi-governmental 
organizations: the RCA, headquartered in Abu Dhabi, 
and the Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum 
Charitable and Humanitarian Foundation in Dubai. 
For their part, the ladies were very happy to work 
with the RCA.  One stressed that, with the RCA, 
they knew that the money was going to help the 
needy and not to line the pockets of someone in the 
Palestinian Authority.  The group also worked to 
provide food to Iraqis in the aftermath of the Gulf 
War, but has returned to its efforts on behalf of 
the Palestinian people.  End Comment
