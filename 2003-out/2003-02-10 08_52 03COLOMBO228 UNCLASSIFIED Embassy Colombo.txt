E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: KIRC OIIP
SUBJECT: UPGRADING POSITION, IRC DIRECTOR, COLOMBO (N721- 
01), FROM FSN10 TO FSN11 
 
 
¶1. IN NOVEMBER 2002, COLOMBO'S IRC DIRECTOR, MS. MANORANI 
"MANO" KARUNANAYAKE, RETIRED AFTER 34 YEARS OF OUTSTANDING 
SERVICE TO THE MISSION.  THE DIFFICULT SEARCH FOR A 
SUCCESSOR BROUGHT FORCIBLY TO OUR ATTENTION SOMETHING ON 
WHICH, FRANKLY, WE SHOULD HAVE FOCUSED EARLIER:  THE 
POSITION IS GRADED AT FSN10.  THIS IS A BIG MISTAKE.  WE 
NEED TO CORRECT IT.  GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS POSITION 
TO OUR OBJECTIVES HERE, THE NEED TO ATTRACT THE HIGHEST 
QUALITY EMPLOYEE, THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITIES AND RESOURCES 
FOR WHICH THE DIRECTOR IS RESPONSIBLE, AND THE LEVEL OF 
CONTACTS WITH WHOM HE/SHE REGULARLY INTERACTS, THE IRC 
DIRECTOR POSITION SHOULD CARRY THE GRADE OF FSN11. 
 
¶2.  COLOMBO'S IRC IS THE INSTITUTIONAL PUBLIC FACE OF OUR 
MISSION.  IT IS OFTEN FIRST PORTAL FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE 
OPINION-MAKING SRI LANKANS, AND JUST AS OFTEN WHERE THEY 
RETURN FOR INFORMATION ON AMERICAN SOCIETY AND USG POLICY. 
THAT IS WHY THE IRC DIRECTOR INTERACTS DAILY -- AND 
FREQUENTLY SOLO -- WITH CULTURAL, COMMERCIAL, DIPLOMATIC, 
GOVERNMENT, AND MEDIA CONTACTS, OFTEN AT THE HIGHEST 
LEVEL.  HE/SHE ALSO PLANS, DEVELOPS, AND EXECUTES IRC 
ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ITS ACQUISITION PROCEDURES, AND ITS 
PROGRAMS OF OUTREACH TO THE MISSION'S CONTACTS AND OF 
INREACH TO THE MISSION'S OFFICERS.  THE DIRECTOR IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR IRC'S RESEARCH FACILITIES, AMONG THE MOST 
SOPHISTICATED IN SRI LANKA, SUPERVISES THE IRC STAFF, AND 
MANAGES ITS BUDGET.  THROUGH THE PAO, THE DIRECTOR ADVISES 
THE COUNTRY TEAM ON HOW TO USE IRC ASSETS TO FURTHER KEY 
MPP GOALS. 
 
¶3. MANO REMINDED US ABOUT THE IMPACT OF VALUED EMPLOYEES 
ON THE JOBS THAT THEY OCCUPY; ABOUT HOW THE BEST FSNS NOT 
ONLY GROW IN THE JOB BUT GROW THE JOB ITSELF.  IN FINDING 
HER REPLACEMENT, WE HAVE BECOME SADLY AWARE THAT FSN10 
REMUNERATION LEVELS WILL NEITHER ATTRACT NOR RETAIN SRI 
LANKANS WITH THE EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE, AND SKILLS 
REQUIRED OF THIS IMPORTANT POSITION.  SIMPLY PUT, WE 
CANNOT COMPETE FOR THE TOP INDIVIDUALS WE WANT AND NEED. 
WE, THEREFORE, STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THE POSITION CARRY 
THE GRADE IT DESERVES, TO WIT, THAT OF FSN11.
