SUBJECT:  SHIKHMURADOV DEPORTATION 
 
REF:  STATE 98760 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) Upon notification Polchief engaged with 
multiple layers of the UAEG on the Boris 
Shikhmuradov case.  The Ambassador followed-up with 
MFA Assistant U/S for Political Affairs Abdullah 
Rashid.  We are pleased to report that as a result 
of our efforts, the Emiratis have made the 
following assurances: 
 
-- The Shikhmuradov family will not/not be deported 
to Turkmenistan or Russia under any circumstances; 
 
-- They are free to go wherever they want; 
 
-- The family can remain in the UAE until April 24. 
 
¶3. (C) Abdullah Rashid, in providing the above 
assurances, explained to the Ambassador that when 
Mr. Shikhmuradov's residency visa was cancelled in 
March, the UAE immigration authorities explained 
that he would need to leave the country and advised 
him not to seek reentry.  (Note:  The Shikhmuradovs 
flew to Cyprus in late March where they obtained 
visit visas to reenter the UAE.  End Note.)   Thus 
the UAEG believes Shikhmuradov wilfully ignored 
their instructions by obtaining a visit visa. 
 
¶4. (C) In our various conversations with Mr. 
Shikhmuradov, he noted that he does not have visas 
to any European countries.  However, he obtained an 
airport visa when he entered Cyprus in March. 
 
¶5. (C) On April 19. we contacted UNHCR liaison 
office representative May Kadkoy who explained that 
it would be preferable for the Shikhmuradovs to 
apply for refugee status in a country other than 
the UAE, because the UAEG is not a party to the 
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.  She 
noted that Cyprus is a signatory to the convention 
and that it would be preferable for him to file 
there. 
 
¶6. (C) Comment:  We see little chance that the UAEG 
will permit Shikhmurdov to remain in the UAE beyond 
April 24.  We suggest that he find a country, such 
as Cyprus, which is signatory to the refugee 
convention, and file his claim there.  We would 
strongly advise against him remaining in the UAE 
where filing a refugee claim is difficult and 
lengthy even in the best of circumstances.  End 
Comment.
