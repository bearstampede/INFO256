SUBJECT: TURKISH GENERAL STAFF TEMPORARILY SUSPENDS OEF 
BLANKET CLEARANCE 
 
(u) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: 
1.5 (B and D) 
 
 
¶1. (S) The Embassy learned late March 18 from AMCC Incirlik 
that the Turkish General Staff (TGS) has temporarily 
suspended the blanket clearance that the GOT had provided the 
US for aircraft in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 
(OEF).  TGS Deputy J3 for Command and Control Maj. Gen. Ozer 
reportedly took the decision to suspend the clearance after 
learning that three USAF-contracted 747 aircraft had used the 
blanket clearance to bring into Incirlik Air Base cargo in 
support of site preparations.  Ozer shares the widely-held 
view among GOT civilian and military officials that the OEF 
blanket clearance does not/not apply to aircraft delivering 
site preparation-related material. 
 
 
¶2. (S) The DATT has requested a meeting with Maj. Gen. Ozer 
to discuss the issue in an effort to clarify any 
misunderstanding that may have occurred and attempt to have 
the OEF blanket clearance reinstated. 
 
 
¶3. (S) Comment:  In the Turks' minds, activities related to 
Operation Enduring Freedom and those related to contingency 
operations against Iraq (including site preparations) are 
distinct and unrelated.  MFA and TGS officials have cautioned 
us against using OEF-related arrangements and procedures for 
site preparation or other Iraq-related activities.  In turn, 
the Embassy, EUCOM Forward and the Office of Defense 
Cooperation (ODC) have taken a number of steps to ensure 
that, in the case of Iraq-related activities, the USG 
continues to operate in Turkey within the strict confines of 
the terms of the site preparation MOU.  The recent incident 
involving the USAF-contracted 747's that resulted in a 
suspension of our OEF blanket clearance is an important 
reminder of the GOT sensitivities on Iraq-related activity in 
Turkey and highlights the importance of making sure that we 
continue to operate according to the agreed upon arrangements 
with the Turks.
