DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 106632 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) On April 29, poloff delivered reftel points and 
non-paper to Ayman Aamiri, Deputy Director of the MFA's IO 
department, asking for Jordan's support in the deletion of 
article 30 of the FCTC as a limited amendment before final 
adoption at the upcoming World Health Assembly.  On the same 
day, econoff delivered the same material to Jordan's Ministry 
of Health.  As of May 8, the MFA told us that Jordan was 
still studying the materials and had not made a decision. 
Dr. Khalid Takhaineh of the MFA's IO Department commented 
that Jordan "would try to support the U.S. position" but 
noted that "what you are requesting is very difficult as it 
goes against the whole trend of international agreements 
since 1995."  Poloff reiterated the importance of this issue 
to the USG, and again pointed to the precedent found in other 
framework conventions where the approach taken on 
reservations is silence.  Dr. Takheineh promised to contact 
us again when the GOJ makes a decision.
