SUBJECT: MISSION SEEKS BILATERALS WITH US OFFICIALS ON THE 
MARGINS OF IMF/WB MEETINGS IN DUBAI 
 
¶1.  (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST; PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 3. 
 
¶2.  (U) AS A MAJOR DONOR TO THE RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS IN 
BOTH AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ AND A STEADFAST PARTNER IN OUR 
EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORIST FINANCING, THE UAEG HAS 
DEMONSTRATED IT IS WILLING TO GO THE DISTANCE TO SUPPORT 
U.S. POLICIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  WE POSIT THAT UAE 
OFFICIALS WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET HIGH-LEVEL 
U.S. DELEGATES ON THE MARGINS OF THE IMF/WORLD BANK MEETINGS 
IN DUBAI AND NOTE THAT SUCH A HIGH-PROFILE EVENT WOULD SERVE 
TO HIGHLIGHT U.S. RECOGNITION OF OUR STRONG FINANCIAL AND 
COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UAE. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: EMBASSY ABU DHABI AND CONGEN DUBAI 
RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING BILATERAL MEETINGS WITH UAE 
OFFICIALS IF THE PRINCIPAL U.S. DELEGATES' SCHEDULES PERMIT: 
 
-- TREASURY SECRETARY SNOW AND/OR FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN 
GREENSPAN MEETING WITH UAE DEFENSE MINISTER AND DUBAI CROWN 
PRINCE MOHAMMED BIN RASHID AL-MAKTOUM AND TITULAR UAE 
FINANCE MINISTER HAMDAN BIN RASHID AL-MAKTOUM (ONE JOINT 
MEETING WITH THE TWO MINISTERS). 
 
-- TREASURY SECRETARY SNOW MEETING WITH DE FACTO FINANCE 
MINISTER MOHAMMED KHALFAN KHIRBASH, WHO MANAGES A VAST 
PORTFOLIO WHICH INCLUDES UAE AID TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN. 
 
-- TREASURY SECRETARY SNOW AND/OR FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN 
GREENSPAN WITH UAE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR SULTAN NASSER AL- 
SUWEIDI, WHO HAS CHAMPIONED OUR BILATERAL EFFORTS TO COMBAT 
TERRORIST FINANCING IN THE REGION. 
 
-- WE ALSO SUGGEST A MEETING BETWEEN TREASURY GENERAL 
COUNSEL DAVID AUFHAUSER, UNDERSECRETARY FOR INTERNATIONAL 
AFFAIRS JOHN TAYLOR, AND DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR 
ENFORCEMENT JUAN ZARATE WITH FINANCE MINISTER KHIRBASH AND 
THE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR TO DISCUSS CONTINUED COOPERATION 
IN THE IDENTIFICATION, FREEZING AND INVESTIGATION OF CERTAIN 
ACCOUNTS IN THE UAE.  (NOTE: WE CAUTION, HOWEVER, THAT THE 
UAE INTERLOCUTORS ARE LIKELY TO RAISE THE ISSUE OF ARBIFT 
WITH TREASURY OFFICIALS AND REQUEST A CLEAR TIMELINE FOR 
RESOLVING THE MATTER.  ALTHOUGH TREASURY OFFICIALS ARE VERY 
FAMILIAR WITH THE ARBIFT CASE, POST IS AVAILABLE TO BRIEF 
USG OFFICIALS, IF REQUESTED.  END NOTE.)  END ACTION 
REQUEST.
