SUBJECT: GUATEMALA NOT FOCUSED ON REINFORCING THE NPT TREATY 
 
REF: STATE 42535 
 
Â¶1.  PolOff conveyed reftel points to Sylvia Corado, Acting 
Director General for Multilateral Affairs at the Foreign 
Ministry, on February 19.  Corado agreed that the DPRK's 
announced intention to withdraw from the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was worrisome but 
had no official response.  PolOff followed up with Corado on 
February 24 and again on February 28, when Corado candidly 
said that the NPT is not a priority for the GOG.  However, 
Corado said the MFA would look for appropriate opportunities 
to make public statements underlining the importance of the 
NPT, as requested reftel.  Corado was not able to speculate 
about the timing or venue for such statements.
