¶1. (U)  This is an action request.  See para 3. 
 
¶2.  (S/NF)  Post looks forward to moving ahead with 
assessment of Zindani and Sabaa Bank and possible decision on 
designation.  Contrary to statement in ref A, however, 
Ambassador has not/not received a copy of the targeting 
report as stated in reftel A.  ORCA advises that said report 
has not been received at post. 
 
¶3.  (S/NF)  Action Requested:  Post requests that the 
Department forward a copy of the targeting report to post as 
soon as possible, and take no decision on designation or 
other action until post is able to review and comment. 
 
¶4.  (S/NF)  Again, post looks forward to moving forward on 
this issue based on available evidence and with due 
consideration of local factors.  In particular, any steps 
toward designation should be keyed to prior consultation with 
ROYG and timed appropriately.
