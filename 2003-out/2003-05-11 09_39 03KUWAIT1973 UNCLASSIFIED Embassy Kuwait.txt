visit to the Ambassador on May 4, and asked him to help 
recover property he and his family had stolen from them 
during the occupation of Kuwait.   Shaykh Ahmed said he had

28 April 2003 
 
Your Excellency Richard H. Jones 
Ambassador of the United States of America 
To the State of Kuwait 
 
Among my invaluable fortune looted by Iraqi soldiers 
during the Iraqi invasion of the State of Kuwait in 1990, 
there's a unique antique "Rolls Royce ) Silver Cloud  64" 
that had been shown on TV's and other media when displaying 
cars in the Palace of Odai, Saddam Husein's elder son.  This 
Rolls Royce is so important that several foreign heads of 
state and top officials who visited Kuwait in the past used 
it.  I enclose the car's traffic documents.  Among my 
belongings, there's also an official coffee china-set had 
been shown in newspapers April 16.  It goes back to 1960's 
and served many heads of state I hosted.  I enclose photos 
verifying that the china-set belongs to me.  You'll find my 
name on each piece.  Photos of the rest of the set, that I 
still have, are also enclosed.  Please kindly let me know the 
proper procedures to restore the above-mentioned Rolls Royce 
and other belongings from Iraq?  Thank you in advance for 
your kind help in this regard. 
With best regards. 
 
Yours Sincerely, 
 
Sheikh Jaber Al-Abdullah Al-Jaber Al-Sabah
