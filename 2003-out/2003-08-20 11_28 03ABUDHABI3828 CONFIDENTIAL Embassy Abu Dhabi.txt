SUBJECT: ZAYED CENTER WEB SITE CLOSED 
 
Refs: A) Abu Dhabi 3817, B) Malenas-Albright 8/20/03 e-mail 
 
C) Abu Dhabi 3801 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Charge d'Affaires, a.i., 
Richard Albright, for Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) The Zayed Center for Coordination and Follow-up 
(ZCCF) Web site has been closed, the first tangible, public 
action by the UAEG against the Center.  "This Site has been 
Stopped," reads the message at www.zccf.org.ae, the 
Center's Web address.  However, Center employees say the 
Center remains open and is receiving letters from Arab 
journalists and intellectuals expressing support and 
solidarity against what they perceive to be an "Zionist 
campaign" against Abu Dhabi-based and funded think tank, 
affiliated with the Arab League. 
 
¶3. (C) Earlier this week, Minister of State for Foreign 
Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan and Information 
Minister Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan had reacted 
with surprise when they learned from Charge that the Web 
site was still open (see refs A, C).  They said they would 
look into the matter.  Apparently, the order to shut down 
the Web site was carried out some time Tuesday night or 
Wednesday morning. 
 
¶4. (U) At the ZCCF, meanwhile, a defiant unnamed ZCCF 
official told the local English language daily "Gulf News" 
that the Center is "being subjected to an unjustified smear 
campaign."  The local press also has published statements 
by GCC and Arab League spokesmen supporting the Center's 
activities.  Today's Arabic language "Al Khaleej" described 
efforts to shut down the Center as a "Zionist campaign." It 
referred to a letter from Syrian Information Minister Adnan 
Omran in which he sees the "disinformation campaign" by 
"Western Zionist elements" as a kind of badge of honor for 
the Center.  The same article cited a letter from Yemeni 
Foreign Minister Dr. Abubakr Al-Qurbi's condemning the 
"Zionist attack" against the ZCCF. 
 
¶5. (C) Concerning the two UAEG emissaries who were supposed 
to go to the U.S. this week to meet with Harvard officials, 
hoping to persuade the university not to return Sheikh 
Zayed's endowment (see ref C), the Department has learned 
from UAE Ambassador Al-Asri that they are meeting 
university representatives in London on August 21 (see ref 
B).  It is unclear if they will go to the U.S. after this. 
A Harvard participant in those meetings who called for 
information on the UAE participants, informed us that 
Harvard plans to take a public position by the time the 
semester starts in early September.  One option involves a 
statement that it is continuing to study the matter. 
 
¶6. (C) COMMENT: There seems to be little doubt about who 
pulled the plug on the Web site.  Sheikh Zayed had ordered 
the Center closed.  The Beni Fatima are following through 
with their father's wishes.  Now that the Web site has been 
disabled, we expect the UAEG to focus on how and when to 
close the Center altogether.  Closing the Web site removes 
the controversial content at the heart of this conflict, 
but the decision provides ammunition for the Center's Arab 
nationalist supporters who are shouting conspiracy.  The 
Emiratis appear determined to pursue their interests in 
avoiding a public slap from Harvard and seem prepared to 
take the flak from the Arab world.  Because of Arab League 
involvement, we expect there could be some action at that 
level.
