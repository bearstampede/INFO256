¶1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA 
FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶2.  (S) The Ambassador told MFA Minstate Hamdan 
bin Zayid June 10 that the authorities in Dubai 
had confirmed that the 43.5 million USD in illicit 
Iraqi missile money had been released by the Dubai 
court several months previously and returned to 
the majority Emirati owned Wasl and Babel company. 
We now needed the assistance of the UAEG to 
examine the financial records of Wasl and Babel to 
determine whether these funds were still in the 
UAE banking system.  If so, the monies should be 
frozen since they represent illicit assets of the 
previous Iraqi regime.  If the funds have been 
transferred elsewhere, we would appreciate access 
to account records and other information which 
might assist us in identifying the destination of 
the 43.5 million usd, and possibly other illicit 
transactions by the former Iraqi regime. 
 
¶3.  (S/NF) Shaykh Hamdan indicated that he fully 
understood the importance of following up on this 
matter and said he would request the information 
from the Central Bank and pass it to us through 
liaison to ORCA.
