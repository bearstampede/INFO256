Central Statistics Organization No (28) of 1995 
Law No. 3 of 1997 regarding Government Tendering, Auctions 
and Purchases. 
Central Bank of Yemen Law No. (14) of 2000

independent of the executive provide reports for the

¶K. Are privatization processes transparent and published? 
Answer: 2. Moderately transparent. 
 
¶L. How would the reliability of budget revenue and 
expenditure estimates best be described? Answer: 2. 
Moderately reliable. 
 
¶M. Short description of host government committment to fiscal 
transparency and accountability. 
 
Answer: The Central Bank and Ministry of Finance are 
committed to fiscal transparency and publish their statistics 
on the internet, in bulletins and in local media.  Local NGOs 
have been active in anti-corruption issues, and the World 
Bank began a program in 2001 working on judicial reform and 
corruption issues. 
 
While Yemen has fundamentally sound investment laws, labor 
laws, customs tariff regulations and tax laws, transparency 
of implementation and enforcement is elusive.  The next steps 
required in Yemen's civil service and administrative reform 
process are to clarify procedures, create implementing 
regulations and build a mechanism to enforce these standards. 
 The formal judicial system is widely regarded as inefficient 
and corrupt.  Parliament has not passed a pending financial 
disclosure law, and Central Bank oversight of government 
accounting practices is considered weak.  End Answer. 
 
 
¶N.  Please list U.S. goernments-sponsored programs and 
activities that promote accurate disclosure of revenue and 
expenditure in the national budgests of your host country. 
 
While post has no specific programs that promote accurate 
disclosure of revenues and expenditures in the national 
budget, post works to promote transparency and accountability 
of budgets and expenditures in all the assistance programs 
provided by the USG.
