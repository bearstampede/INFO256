told poloff on December 8 that Turkey would provide 
humanitarian aid to Georgia in the form of food.  According 
to Adali, Georgian Finance Minister Nogaideli had been in 
contact with the GOT and indicated that Georgia's most urgent 
need was food for the military and other state institutions, 
including schools and jails. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Adali said the Turkish military and Red Crescent 
were collecting food; Adali said the GOT was working from a 
list of 26 food items requested by the GOG.  Turkey will also 
transport the food to Georgia.  The GOG said it needed one 
month's supply of food, which it estimated would cost 
approximately USD 1 million.  Adali speculated that the GOT 
would supply the entire month's amount requested by the GOG.
