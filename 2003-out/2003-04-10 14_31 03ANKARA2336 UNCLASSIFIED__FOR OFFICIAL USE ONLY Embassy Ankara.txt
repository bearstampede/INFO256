(SBU) Econ Counselor and Mission Disaster Relief Officer 
delivered ref A points on the UN Flash Appeal for Iraq to 
Feza Ozturk, MFA Department Head for International 
Political Organizations, on April 8 following a discussion 
of the Turkish Red Crescent's (TRC's) plans to deliver 
humanitarian supplies and provide medical treatment for 
Iraq (ref B).  On April 9, Ozturk confirmed press reports 
that Turkey planned to allocate USD 5 million for 
humanitarian assistance to Iraq.  However, he said that 
the GOT had not yet decided who would deliver this 
assistance:  TRC, Turkish NGOs, UN agencies and Turkish 
government bodies, such as the Ministry of Health, are 
possible vehicles.  A new Humanitarian Aid Coordination 
Board led by Prime Ministry Undersecretary Uccan will 
discuss this question in the near future.
