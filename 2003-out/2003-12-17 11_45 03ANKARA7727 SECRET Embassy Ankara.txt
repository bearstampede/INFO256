(S/NF) From the U.S. point of view, we have no difficulty 
designating IBDA-C, based on activities several years old 
with the leadership still in Turkish jails but with a loose 
group of supporters with questionable capabilities at large. 
If we proceed to designate IBDA-C, there may also be grounds 
to consider designating Turkish Hizbullah. However,we also 
note the following: First, Post does not have, and considers 
it unlikely that it can obtain, any documentary information 
establishing that IBDA-C was responsible for the Istanbul 
bombings of 20 November. Second, IBDA-C's claimed 
responsibility for the bombings is simply not credible at 
this point in the investigation. Third, the GOT may find a 
great deal of irony in the EU's designation of IBDA-C, given 
the EU's failure to designate KADEK and the various other 
aliases of PKK, which GOT (rightfully) considers a far more 
dangerous organization.
