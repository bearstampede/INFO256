START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
As the head of the Communications Unit for the Peace 
Secretariat of Sri Lanka, Miss Jayasuriya holds an 
 
SIPDIS 
important position that will be critical to the 
Secretariat's ability to gain and maintain public 
 
SIPDIS 
confidence.  She would be charged with the preparation 
of a coherent communication strategy for the Sri Lankan 
Government in relation to the peace process.  An IV 
program that will give her wider exposure to U.S. 
organizations working on public information campaigns 
would strengthen her public communication skills and 
further Sri Lanka's peace efforts.  This would enable 
her to work out an effective strategy to educate and 
inform the people of Sri Lanka and other stakeholders 
on the complexity and problems likely to be faced 
during the peace process.
