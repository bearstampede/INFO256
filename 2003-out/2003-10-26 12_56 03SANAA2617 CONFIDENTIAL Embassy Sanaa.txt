SUBJECT: PASSING SECRETARY POWELL'S LETTER ON ARTICLE 98 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edmund J.Hull, Reasons 1.5(b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) On October 25, I met one-on-one with Foreign Minister 
Qirbi and passed a signed copy of the Secretary's letter 
urging quick conclusion of an Article 98 agreement (pouched 
original not yet received).  I also gave Qirbi the exchange 
of diplomatic notes agreed with Egypt redacted to eliminate 
mention of that country.  I then reiterated Bill Burns' 
argument that Yemen should quickly conclude a similar 
agreement before attention grew in either Washington or Sanaa. 
 
¶2. (C) Qirbi carefully read the Secretary's letter and said 
he would raise the issue with President Saleh.  In response 
to Qirbi's request for clarification on various forms which 
agreement might take, I noted that the example I had 
presented had been accepted by a major Arab country and met 
Yemeni concerns for formal reciprocity.  I urged him to focus 
on this model as most appropriate for Yemeni purposes. 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT:  I will continue to track this issue 
personally.
