¶1.  (C)     ON JULY 23, MFA CFSP COORDINATOR AND EUROPEAN 
CORRESPONDENT SANDRO DEBERNARDIN BRIEFED POLOFF ON 
PREPARATIONS FOR THE AUGUST 29 ESDP MEETING DISCUSSED 
REFTELS.  THERE HAD BEEN SOME THOUGHT TO HOLDING THE MEETING 
AT MINISTERS, LEVEL, AND THAT IS STILL A POSSIBILITY, BUT IT 
IS MORE LIKELY THAT POLDIRS FROM THE 25 EXISTING AND NEW EU 
MEMBER STATES WILL BE INVITED TO ROME TO DISCUSS EUROPEAN 
SECURITY ISSUES, INCLUDING PROGRESS ON THE EUROPEAN SECURITY 
STRATEGY. 
 
¶2.  (C)  ACCORDING TO DEBERNARDIN, THE IDEA FOR THE MEETING 
WAS GENERATED AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITHIN THE MFA, INCLUDING 
WITH FM FRATTINI, ON THE BEST METHOD FOR DEALING WITH THE 
PROPOSALS FROM THE FOUR-NATION APRIL 29 MINI-SUMMIT.  THE 
ITALIAN PRESIDENCY WANTS TO "BUILD A BRIDGE" BETWEEN THE FOUR 
AND THE REST OF THE EU AND "TAKE THE POISON OUT OF" THE 
BRUSSELS DOCUMENT.  THE PRESIDENCY WANTS TO MAKE USE OF THE 
POSITIVE ASPECTS OF THE MINI-SUMMIT CONCLUSIONS, SUCH AS THE 
NEED FOR EUROPE TO DEVELOP CAPABILITIES AND A RAPID REACTION 
FORCE, AND TO ELIMINATE SUPPORT FOR HARMFUL INITIATIVES IN 
THE DOCUMENT SUCH AS ESTABLISHING A SEPARATE HEADQUARTERS FOR 
ESDP. 

¶3.  (C)  THE GOI FULLY AGREES WITH U.S. VIEWS THAT 
BERLIN-PLUS MUST REMAIN THE FOUNDATION OF THE DISCUSSIONS. 
ACCORDING TO DEBERNARDIN, THE BRUSSELS-FOUR SUPPORT THE 
ITALIAN INITIATIVE FOR THE AUGUST MEETING, AND HE IS 
OPTIMISTIC THAT A WAY CAN BE FOUND TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS 
WITHOUT ESTABLISHING A SEPARATE HEADQUARTERS.  DEBERNARDIN 
WOULD LIKE THE U.S. TO HELP, QUIETLY, IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS 
GOAL, AND ASKED FOR OUR POINTS/INPUT AS ITALY PLANS FOR THE 
MEETING DURING THE AUGUST BREAK. 
 
¶4.  (S/NOFORN)  REQUESTING NOT TO BE QUOTED, DEBERNARDIN 
(STRICTLY PROTECT) OPINED THAT FURTHER PUBLIC CRITICISM BY 
THE US ON THE MINI-SUMMIT DOCUMENT COULD BE HARMFUL AND 
JEOPARDIZE THESE ATTEMPTS AT COMPROMISE; IT COULD CAUSE THE 
LEADERSHIP OF THE FOUR TO DIG IN THEIR HEELS ON THE HQ ISSUE. 
POLOFF POINTED OUT THAT THE PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE 
ESDP HQ FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE BERLIN-PLUS AGREEMENTS ON 
NON-DUPLICATION, AND THE U.S. WOULD CONTINUE TO CRITICIZE 
SUCH PROPOSALS WHENEVER THEY ARE RAISED. 
 
¶5.  (C)  COMMENT AND GUIDANCE REQUEST.  THE GOI IS MAKING A 
GOOD FAITH ATTEMPT TO KEEP THE DEBATE ON ESDP AT 15(25), 
WHERE IT BELONGS, AND WHERE US VIEWS HOLD GREATER SWAY.  POST 
STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT WE TAKE DEBERNARDIN UP ON HIS OFFER 
TO CONTRIBUTE (QUIETLY, IN ROME) TO THE PROCESS, WITH IDEAS 
FOR THE AUGUST 29 MEETING'S CONCLUDING DOCUMENT THAT ADDRESS 
THE  PERCEIVED NEED FOR A SEPARATE ESDP HQ.  COUNCIL 
SECRETARIAT DG ROBERT COOPER ALLUDED TO THE PROBLEM DURING 
 
SIPDIS 
THE JULY 18 POLDIRS' TROIKA (REF A)  WHEN HE SAID THAT SHAPE 
DOES NOT YET FUNCTION AS A PLATFORM FOR BERLIN PLUS AND 
PLANNING FOR EU OPERATIONS.
