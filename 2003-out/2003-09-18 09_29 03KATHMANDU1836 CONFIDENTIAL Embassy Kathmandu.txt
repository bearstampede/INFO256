SUBJECT: NEPAL:  ARMY ATTACK ON MAOISTS DEADLIEST SINCE THE 
END OF THE CEASEFIRE 
 
 
Classified By: POL/ECON PMAHONEY.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Fighting between the Royal Nepal Army (RNA) and 
Maoist insurgents continued Sept. 18 for the second day in 
the mid-western district of Rolpa.  To date, at least 35 
Maoists and 4 RNA soldiers have been killed in the deadliest 
clash since the Maoists broke a seven-month ceasefire on 
August 27.  The fighting coincides with the beginning of a 
three-day nationwide strike called by the Maoists. 
 
¶2.  (C)  According to Brig. Gen. Kul Bahadur Khadga, the 
RNA's Director of Military Operations, the RNA attacked the 
Maoists at a base in their Rolpa stronghold.  About 17-18 
company-sized units of the 4th Brigade (based in Surkhet) are 
involved in the operation, assisted by 2-3 companies from the 
10th Brigade.  So far the RNA has recovered a total of 8 
weapons (4 self-loading rifles and 4. 303s).  The DMO said he 
expects the fighting to continue for another three days. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Embassy will continue to monitor reports on the 
situation in Rolpa and provide more information as it becomes 
available.
