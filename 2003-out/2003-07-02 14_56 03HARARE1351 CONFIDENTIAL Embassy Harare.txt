SUBJECT: MDC REQUESTS MEETINGS WITH POTUS DELEGATION IN RSA 
 
 
Classified By: Political Officer Audu Besmer for reasons 1.5 b/d 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request; please see paragraph two. 
 
Summary and Action Request: 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) MDC Presidential Advisor, Gandi Mudzingwa, requested 
meetings with member(s) of the POTUS delegation at whatever 
level would be appropriate for an MDC delegation that will be 
traveling to South Africa soon.  Mudzingwa said the main 
message the MDC would like to convey is that the MDC is open 
to restarting dialogue with Mugabe, but Mugabe has scuttled 
all initiatives in this vein.  We provisionally recommend a 
meeting with AS Kansteiner.  End Summary and Action Request. 
 
Meetings in RSA Requested 
------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) On July 1 MDC Presidential Advisor, Gandi Mudzingwa, 
requested meetings at whatever level would be appropriate for 
an MDC delegation that will be traveling to South Africa for 
the POTUS visit.  MDC Deputy Secretary General, Gift 
Chimanikire is heading a political delegation that will also 
include Shadow Minister of Justice, David Coltart, and 
Secretary for Economic Affairs, Tendai Biti.  Paul 
 
SIPDIS 
Themba-Nyathi, MDC spokesperson, is also heading a separate 
public affairs delegation. 
 
Roadmap to Peace? 
------------------ 
 
¶4. (C) Although a June 27 Reuters article reported that the 
party's President Morgan Tsvangirai said the MDC was 
developing a "roadmap to peace" to present to the Bush 
delegation, the following is all that has evolved of this 
initiative thus far: 
 
¶5. (C) The two sides in Zimbabwe are not talking (this is in 
response to news reports of Mbeki's comments that ZANU-PF and 
MDC are talking).  The MDC believes that ZANU-PF would like 
to manage the crisis and buy time and ensure ZANU-PF 
succession, rather than solve the crisis.  Rather than 
opening up to talks, Mugabe has in fact scuttled various 
initiatives at restarting dialogue, or played one off the 
other.  The MDC, in contrast, is open to dialogue. 
Tsvangirai has requested a meeting with the Ambassador for 
 
SIPDIS 
July 4 in which Mudzingwa said Tsvangirai plans to deliver 
the MDC message to us in greater detail. 
 
¶6. (C) Mudzingwa said that domestically, the MDC is looking 
for a formula to restart negotiations with Mugabe.  In 
response to conflicting reports that the MDC would both 
support and not support a unity government with the ruling 
party, Mudzingwa did not clarify adequately.  (Note: It is 
possible the MDC is still working out language / policy on 
this.  End Note.) 
 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
¶7. (C) It is not yet clear whether the MDC really plans to 
put forward a roadmap to peace with any reasonable level of 
detail.  So far, their planned pitch to the POTUS delegation 
remains uncertain.  However, we anticipate they will flesh 
out the plan by July 4, and we would recommend consideration 
of a meeting with AS Kansteiner.  We will report back on the 
July 4 meeting, including any roadmap specifics that come up. 
 We did not find out from the MDC if they have informed South 
Africans of their desire to meet with members of the POTUS 
delegation, and this should be clarified.  End Comment.
