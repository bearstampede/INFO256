 ¶1.  (C) Press reports (cited in reftels) have pointed to 
preparations for September 20-21 exploratory peace talks 
between the New People's Army and Government of the 
Philippines in Oslo.  The Dutch government told us that NPA 
leader Sison has applied for permission to leave the 
Netherlands to attend the talks with a guarantee that he be 
allowed to return.  The Dutch have indicated they will 
probably comply with Sison's request but only after receiving 
an official request from the Phillippine government to allow 
Sison to travel and presumably to engage in limited financial 
transactions to support his journey.  Both Sison and the NPA 
are on the EU list of designated terrorist entities whose 
accounts must be frozen and financial transactions blocked.
