(SBU) A/DCM passed Ref A answers regarding the $1 billion 
financial assistance package to Treasury Deputy U/S Aydin 
Karaoz May 12.  Karaoz said that, based on the May 9 
Babacan-Taylor phone conversation, he understood the USG 
would prepare and present a draft financial agreement, after 
which the GOT would send a technical team to Washington to 
discuss it.  A/DCM said his understanding was that U/S Taylor 
had undertaken to get back to Minister Babacan early this 
week about next steps, and that all concerned seemed to agree 
that technical discussions would take place in Washington.
