SUMMARY/ACTION REQUEST 
---------------------- 
 
 
¶1. (C) The Turkish MFA has responded positively to requests 
from the Iraqi MFA and the Iraqi Tribal Coalition to provide 
these organizations office supplies.  The MFA is prepared to 
send these goods (via the Habur Gate) as soon as 
authorization from OCPA is received.  The MFA requests that 
US authorities in Iraq take appropriate security measures to 
help ensure safe passage for two Turkish drivers/trucks that 
will transport the supplies.  The Embassy would appreciate 
notification from OCPA once authorization for the shipment of 
the supplies is granted.  End summary/action request.

TURKS RESPOND POSITIVELY TO REQUEST FROM IRAQI MFA 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
¶2. (C) The MFA sent the Embasy a diplomatic note late June 16 
(see para 4 for text) notifying us that the MFA intended to 
send office furniture and other supplies to the Iraqi MFA and 
the Iraqi Tribal Coalition in Baghdad.  MFA Iraq Department 
Head Kerim Uras told us that the two Iraqi organizations had 
asked that Turkey provide the supplies during the Turkish MFA 
delegation's mid-May visit to Iraq (reftel).  Uras said the 
MFA had recommended that the two Iraqi organizations apply to 
the OCPA to obtain the necessary permission for the MFA to 
send the supplies to Iraq.  Uras said he was uncertain 
whether the two Iraqi organizations had applied for 
permission, or whether OCPA had granted the permission.  Uras 
said that, in the meantime, the MFA wanted to send the office 
supplies to Baghdad at the end of the week (June 19 or 20) in 
anticipation of eventual permission. 
 
 
¶3. (C) Pol-Mil officer stressed to Uras the importance of 
coordinating all shipments into Iraq with OCPA and advised 
that the MFA hold off on sending the shipments across the 
Habur Gate until authorized by OCPA (MFA had wanted to store 
the supplies at the Turkish Embassy pending OCPA approval). 
Uras said the MFA recognized the importance of coordinating 
fully with the USG on all matters related to Iraq, and agreed 
to not send the supplies until authorization is granted.
