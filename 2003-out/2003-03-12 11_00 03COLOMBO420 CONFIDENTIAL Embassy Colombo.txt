SUBJECT:  Iraq:  Mission conveys demarche on UNSC open 
session to Sri Lankan and Maldivian governments 
 
Ref:  State 63629 
 
(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of 
Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d) 
 
¶1.  (C) Per Reftel, Mission has urged the Sri Lankan and 
Maldivian MFA's to express support for the joint 
US/UK/Spanish Iraq resolution. 
 
¶2.  (C) Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Nihal Rodrigo told 
us that Sri Lanka's UN representative had instructions 
to speak if there is "a cast of thousands" participating 
in the open session.  Sri Lanka does not want to be on 
the forefront of this issue, but it also does not want 
to be completely on the sidelines.  If the Sri Lankan 
representative speaks, Rodrigo indicated that the 
message would be that Iraq must comply with all UN 
resolutions, but that inspections should be given enough 
time. 
 
¶3.  (C) We have not yet received any reaction from the 
Maldivian MFA to our demarche. 
 
¶4.  (U) Minimize considered.
