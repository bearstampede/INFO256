¶1.  (U)  This is an action request.  Please see para 3. 
 
 
¶2.  (C)  Polmiloff on April 25 spoke with MFA/Disarmament 
Second Secretary Aykut Kumbaroglu to inquire if there had 
been any further movement on Turkey's objection to three 
articles of our proposed Export Control and Related Border 
Security Assistance (EXBS) Program agreement (ref a). 
Kumbaroglu informed us that Turkey's position was firm in 
that the articles are not in conformity with Turkish 
legislation. Polmiloff then asked if the GOT could suggest 
acceptable alternative language. He replied that such an 
exercise was futile as the entirety of the three articles 
were problematic and could not be fixed by wordsmithing the 
language.  He then went on to say the MFA assumed the 
Agreement was a "template" one presented by the USG to 
several governments with no negotiating process or 
country-specific considerations.  Thus, no regard had been 
given to Turkey's specific legislative obstacles.  He 
proposed once again that Turkey and the US continue to 
cooperate with "purpose-oriented projects" without an 
extensive, overarching agreement.  Polmiloff informed 
Kumbaroglu that the Department's position is that further 
equipment installation and other EXBS program projects cannot 
go forward absent the GOT's signing the proposed agreement. 
Polmiloff asked Kumbaroglu to convey this information to his 
Department Head. 
 
 
¶3.  (C)  Action Request:  Post requests the Department's 
guidance on next steps.  It would seem that we need either 
bilateral negotiations with the GOT to overcome Turkey's 
specific legislative obstacles or we need to consider the GOT 
recommendation to proceed on a project-by-project basis, 
short of an overarching EXBS agreement.  Please advise.
