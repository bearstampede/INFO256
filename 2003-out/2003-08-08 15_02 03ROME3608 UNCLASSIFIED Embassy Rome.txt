¶1.   SUMMARY: MAD COW DISEASE RETURNED TO 
ITALIAN NEWSPAPERS WITH THE DEATH OF A 
YOUNG SICILIAN WOMAN WHO SUCCUMBED TO 
VARIANT CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE (VCJD) 
AUGUST 6.  THIS IS ITALY'S FIRST CONFIRMED 
DEATH FROM THE DISEASE. STATEMENTS FROM 
CONFIRMED DEATH FROM THE DISEASE. 
STATEMENTS FROM THE ITALIAN MINISTER 
OF HEALTH GIROLAMO SIRCHIA WERE 
MEANT TO CONVEY CONDOLENCES TO THE 
FAMILY, TO CALM FEARS ABOUT ITALIAN 
MEAT CONSUMPTION, AND TO DEFEND THE 
MINISTRY OF HEALTH'S ROLE IN 
SAFEQUARDINQ THE ITALIAN MEAT SUPPLY 
FROM POSSIBLE CRITICISM. 

¶2.  THE HUMAN DISEASE VCJD IS LINKED 
TO THE CONSUMPTION OF BEEF FROM A 
BSE-POSITIVE ANIMAL.  ALL NEWSPAPER 
ACCOUNTS REPORTED ON A GOI MINHEALTH 
STATEMENT LINKINQ THE CASE TO 
IMPORTED MEAT OR MEAT FROM AN 
INFECTED COUNTRY. HOWEVER, THE 
MINISTRY OF HEALTH DISAVOWS THAT 
MINISTER SIRCHIA MADE THIS STATEMENT. 
PENDING THE RESULTS OF AN AUTOPSY, 
THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS NO 
OFFICIAL STATEMENT. COMMENT:  ITALY 
IS A NET IMPORTER OF BEEF. ANYONE WHO 
EATS BEEF IN ITALY IS LIKELY TO EAT 
IMPORTED BEEF. PRESS REPORTS ALSO 
CONTAINED VARIOUS SPECULATIVE

THE DISEASE, INCLUDING TRAVEL TO 
FRANCE. NO ONE CAN KNOW PRECISELY AT

¶3.  THE FIRST CONFIRMED CASE OF THE 
ANIMAL DISEASE BOVINE SPONQIFORM 
ENCEPHALOPATHY, BSE, WAS IDENTIFIED 
IN THE UK IN NOVEMBER 1986. PRIOR TO 
A BAN ON EXPORT OF ENQLISH BEEF 
ENACTED IN MARCH 1996, ITALY AND MANY 
OTHER COUNTRIES PURCHASED CATTLE AND 
BEEF FROM THE UK. ITALY'S MAIN BEEF 
    CATTLE SOURCES ARE CURRENTLY FRANCE, 
GERMANY, AND DENMARK. LITTLE IS KNOWN 
ABOUT THE INCUBATION PERIOD BETWEEN 
EXPOSURE TO THE INFECTIVE AQENT AND 
THE EMERQENCE OF SYMPTOMS IN HUMANS. 
THERE ARE MANY INFORMATIVE WEBSITES 
ON BSE AND VCJO INCLUDINQ THE U.S. 
HTTP://WWW.CDC.QOV, THE U.S. 
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 
HTTP://WWW.FSIS.USDA.QOV/OA/TOPICS/BS 
E AND THE UNITED KINQDOM'S DEPARTMENT 
FOR ENVIRONMENT FOOD AND RURAL 
AFFAIRS HTTP://WWW.DEFRA.UK . THE 
UNITED KINDOM CJD SURVEILLANCE UNIT 
HAS CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH ONE 
HUNDRED HUMAN CASES AND REPORTS ON 
THESE AT HTTP://WWW.CJD.ED.AC.UK 
 
¶4.  IN ITALY TESTS FOR BSE ARE NOW 
ROUTINELY DONE ON BEEF CATTLE FOR 
SLAUQHTER FOR ALL ANIMALS OVER THE 
AQE OF 30 MONTHS. THIS REQUIREMENT 
BEQAN IN JANUARY 2001. THE GOI 
MINHEALTH PRESENTS THESE TESTS AS 
EVIDENCE THAT ANIMAL CASES HAVE 
PEAKED AND ARE NOW IN DECLINE. IN 
 
ROME 00003608  002 OF 002 
 
AND REMOVED FROM 
THE FOOD AND FEED CHAIN. THE 
INCIDENCE OF HUMAN CASES DOES NOT 
TRACK ON THE SAME TIMELINE AS ANIMAL 
CASES BECAUSE THE INCUBATION PERIOD 
OF VCJD CAN EXCEED A DECADE. IN 
ADDITION, IN ITALY SLAUQHTER 
OCCURRINQ OUTSIDE LEQAL PROCEDURES IS 
UNTESTED. CONSEQUENTLY, TESTINQ AND 
THE RESULTS OF TESTS ARE AN 
INCOMPLETE PICTURE OF ALL BEEF IN 
COMMERCIAL CHANNELS IN ITALY. SEMBLER
