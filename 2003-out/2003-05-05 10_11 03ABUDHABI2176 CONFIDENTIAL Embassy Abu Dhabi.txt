SUBJECT: UAE FORMALLY ANNOUNCES INTENTION TO ASSUME 
CHAIRMANSHIP OF ARBIFT 
 
REF:  A) 02 ABU DHABI 5714 (NOTAL) 
 
      B) 02 ABU DHABI 3406 
 
¶1. (U)  CLASSIFIED BY DCM RICHARD A. ALBRIGHT FOR 
REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶2. (C)  The UAE last week moved one step closer to 
its goal of assuming total managerial control of 
the Arab Bank for Investment and Foreign Trade 
(ARBIFT) by announcing at the annual general 
meeting (AGM) in Abu Dhabi its formal intention to 
assume the chairmanship of the Board of the bank. 
A new Board of Directors was selected at the AGM; 
that body will meet shortly to choose the chairman 
-- who will be an Emirati.  UAE Finance Ministry 
Undersecretary Khalid Al-Bustani told Econchief May 
5 that he expects the Board will meet within the 
next few weeks. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Comment:  Day-to-day management of ARBIFT 
is completely controlled by Emirati nationals. 
However, the chairmanship of the Board of 
Directors, while largely symbolic, has until now 
been held by a Libyan.  The bank, which is owned 
42.5 percent by Libya, 42.5 percent by the UAE and 
15 percent by Algeria, has since the 1990s been 
designated by OFAC as a Libyan entity.  Currently, 
more than 120 million USD of ARBIFT money (none of 
it payable to or from Libyan entities) is frozen in 
the USA.  The UAEG is eager to seek the 
release/licensing of these funds and hopes that 
replacing the chairman of the board will initiate 
meaningful discussions on a long-term solution to 
the ARBIFT issue which would see the SDN status 
removed and, eventually, Libyan equity 
participation in the bank diluted significantly.
