E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL PHUM HR IZ
SUBJECT: TFIZ01: CROATIAN CABINET ORDERS HUMANITARIAN 
CONTRIBUTION FOR IRAQ 
 
 
¶1.  (U) ON APRIL 3, THE CROATIAN CABINET PASSED A DECISION 
(SEE TEXT AT PARA 4) TO SEND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE WITH A 
VALUE OF JUST UNDER USD 3 MILLION TO IRAQ.  THE ASSISTANCE 
SHOULD INCLUDE BLANKETS, SLEEPING BAGS, BED LINENS, FLOUR, 
SUGAR, AND WATER PURIFICATION AGENTS.  THE CABINET ALSO 
DIRECTED THE GOC TO CONSIDER SENDING "EXPERT ASSISTANCE" TO 
SUPPORT HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS IN IRAQ. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) ON APRIL 4 WE MET WITH ANDREA BEKIC OF THE MFA'S 
NORTH AMERICAN DESK TO SEEK FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE 
CROATIAN CONTRIBUTION.  BEKIC INSISTED THAT CROATIA WANTS TO 
BE SEEN -- PARTICULARLY BY THE U.S. -- AS DOING ITS PART FOR 
POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION.  THE MFA HAD BEEN TASKED BY THE 
SENIOR-LEVEL "CRISIS COMMITTEE" TO FIND WAYS TO TRANSPORT THE 
CARGO.  GIVEN PAST DIFFICULTIES, WE MADE SURE SHE UNDERSTOOD 
THAT ORGANIZING AIRLIFT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT; THE GOC 
SHOULD NOT/NOT COUNT ON A POSITIVE RESPONSE IF IT APPROACHES 
THE USG WITH A REQUEST FOR AIRLIFT. 
 
¶3.   (SBU) BEKIC SAID THAT CROATIA'S MISSION TO NATO WAS 
MAKING ARRANGEMENTS WITH COLLEAGUES IN BRUSSELS FOR DELIVERY 
OF PART OF THE DONATION TO TURKEY.  THE REST OF THE DONATION 
IS DESIGNATED FOR USE IN IRAQ.  WE SUGGESTED THAT OTHER 
COUNTRIES INTERESTED IN MAKING AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON THE 
HUMANITARIAN SITUATION ARE MAKING MONETARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
    NGO'S ALREADY ACTIVE IN THE REGION.  CROATIA'S EMBASSY IN 
WASHINGTON SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED AT THE WEEKLY 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE MEETINGS. 
 
¶4.  (U) BEGIN TEXT OF THE GOC APRIL 5 DECISION (NOTE INTERNAL 
NUMBERING): 
 
(I)  ABOUT 20 MILLION KUNA (USD 2.85 MILLION) WORTH OF 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE SHALL BE SENT TO THE WAR-AFFECTED 
POPULATION IN IRAQ. 
 
(II)  THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE SHALL BE SENT AS NEEDED AND 
POSSIBLE TO DISTRIBUTE. 
 
(III)  THE ASSISTANCE SHALL CONSIST OF BLANKETS, TENTS, 
SLEEPING BAGS, FLOUR, SUGAR, FIELD BEDS, BED LINEN, AND 
WATER-PURIFICATION AGENTS. 
 
(IV)  THE CRISIS COMMITTEE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF CROATIA SHALL 
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS DECISION. 
 
(V)  THE CRISIS COMMITTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA IS 
INSTRUCTED TO CONSIDER SENDING EXPERT ASSISTANCE AIMED AT 
ALLEVIATING THE CONSEQUENCES OF WAR IN IRAQ.
