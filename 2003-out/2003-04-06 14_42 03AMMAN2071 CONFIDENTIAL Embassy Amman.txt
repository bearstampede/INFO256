SUBJECT: UNESCO EXECUTIVE BOARD: DEMARCHE ON IRAQ DELIVERED 
TO JORDAN 
 
REF: A. STATE 84179 
 
     ¶B. STATE 88308 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  On April 3 and again on April 6, PolCouns raised 
with Ali al-Ayed, Personal Assistant to Foreign Minister 
Marwan Muasher, points from reftels on the possibility of a 
Cuban proposal to discuss Iraq in the UNESCO Executive Board. 
PolCouns stressed the inappropriateness of a politicized 
discussion of Iraq at UNESCO.  Discussion of this matter 
belongs more appropriately in the Security Council.  Al-Ayed 
took the points and promised to convey them to the Minister 
and others dealing with UN affairs.
