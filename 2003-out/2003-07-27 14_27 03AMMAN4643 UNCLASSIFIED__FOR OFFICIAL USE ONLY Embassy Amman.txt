Assistant Secretary of State

United States Department of State 
Washington, D.C. 
 
Your Excellency, 
 
I refer to Your Excellency's letter regarding Jordan's 
Education Reform Initiative. 
 
The gracious and stately support that the United States has 
demonstrated, over the years, to Jordan has been and will 
remain to hold a considerable impact on our realization of 
unsurpassed accomplishments and ability to continue in our 
steadfast mission of achieving diverse social and economic 
initiatives for the advancement and progress of our people. 
 
In this context, allow me Your Excellency, to extend my 
gratitude for your continuous support and for Mrs. Elizabeth 
Cheney's commitment to helping Jordan in the field of 
education reforms, which will hopefully be presented through 
the Middle East Partnership Initiative.  This initiative 
represents an additional model of the United States' 
commitment to supporting developing countries in their 
efforts toward the development and the prosperity of their 
people. 
 
In the meantime, please accept my highest esteem and 
consideration. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Bassem I. Awadallah 
Minister of Planning
