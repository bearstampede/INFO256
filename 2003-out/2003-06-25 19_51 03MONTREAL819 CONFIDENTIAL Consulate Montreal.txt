SUBJECT: FRAUDULENT CANADIAN ACADEMIC DOCUMENTATION 
 
Classified By: Richard Kanter, Principal Officer for reasons 1.5(B) and 
 
1.5(D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  Summary:  An active Canadian Public Security 
Anti-terrorism Unit investigation has revealed that an 
organized group of Pakistani males in Canada and Pakistan are 
presenting academic documentation purporting to be issued by 
the Ottawa Business College.  This school exists in name only 
with the sole intent of enabling foreign nationals to obtain 
study permits for applications for Permanent Residence in 
Canada. 
 
¶2.  (C)  The Pakistani males have generally been in the 20-30 
year old age group.  They list the Ottawa Business College 
with an address of 1825 Markham Road, Scarborough, Ontario 
M1B 4Z9.  It should also be noted that this school has used 
the name Kingston College.  There is a legitimate school that 
is also named Kingston College Inc. located at 2286 Holdom, 
Burnaby, British Columbia V5B 4Y5. 
 
¶3.  (C)  A trend has emerged that individuals associated with 
the Ottawa Business College in Ontario will obtain study 
permits and then make Convention Refugee claims by making 
slight variations to their names and dates of birth. 
Consequently, these individuals will maintain two identities 
in Canada allowing them to travel internationally while their 
refugee claims are processed.
