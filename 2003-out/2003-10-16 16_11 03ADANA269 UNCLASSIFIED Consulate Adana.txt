¶2. HURRIYET/MILLIYET/ZAMAN/EKSPRES/TURKIYE: During 
his visit to the Cukurova Journalists 
Association, Adana's governor Kemal Onal told 
reporters that their main challenges were in 
education, health and housing for the poor 
people. Governor Onal said they needed six 
thousand classrooms, that is 300 schools with 
20 classrooms in each, to solve the education 
problem in Adana. He added that they were 
building fourteen schools this year. Governor 
Onal attributed Adana's population growth to 
its being the attraction center of the region, 
and added that this position would continue 
until the disparity between the regions was 
solved. He emphasized that the First Cukurova 
Industry and Trade Fair held in Adana last week 
would contribute greatly to the volume of 
industry and trade in the region. 
 
 
¶3. HURRIYET: Justice and Development Party's (AKP)

stated at a press conference that the method 
for determining candidates and the calendar for

¶4. YENI SAFAK: "Freedom for Developing Local 
Languages" bill which the government passed 
with the Sixth Harmonization Laws for 
integration with EU is not being applied. No 
classes have been opened anywhere in Turkey for 
developing Kurdish or other languages. Private 
school owners in Diyarbakir, Van, Sanliurfa, 
Mardin, and Kiziltepe who applied to the 
provincial governors to open Kurdish classes 
were denied on the grounds that the buildings 
in which Kurdish would be taught lacked fire 
escape stairs and technical equipment for 
heating. Kurdish names containing "q, x, and w" 
are still not registered on the grounds that 
those letters do not exist in the Turkish 
alphabet.
