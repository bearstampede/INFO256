TAGS: PREF PREL KPAL JO UNRWA
SUBJECT: THINKING ABOUT UNRWA SUCCESSION 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDWARD W. GNHEM PER 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
(C) UNRWA Commissioner General Peter Hansen's third 
three-year term will expire in February 2005 and senior UNRWA 
officials have indicated to us that Hansen intends to step 
down at that time.  In order to ensure that this third term 
really is Hansen's last, we must begin the succession process 
now, working with like-minded donors to identify strong 
candidates, build consensus on our top choices and then lobby 
UNSYG Annan to ensure his support for our candidate.  I hope 
that the Department can identify a short list of candidates 
in the next few months so we can hold substantive discussions 
with other donors on the margins of the June 2004 UNRWA 
conference in Geneva.  Donors need to reach agreement on a 
top slate of candidates at the September 2004 UNRWA Major 
Donors Meeting, at the very latest.  My team and I are 
prepared to assist in this process in any way possible.  Warm 
regards. 
GNEHM
