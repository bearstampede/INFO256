TAGS: PREL IZ JO UNGA
SUBJECT: DEMARCHE TO JORDAN ON BLOCKING UNGA MEETING ON IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 84320 
 
Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
Â¶1.  (C)  PolCouns on April 3 and again on April 6 raised ref 
points on possible UNGA discussion of Iraq with Ali al-Ayed, 
Personal Assistant to Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher. 
PolCouns emphasized that, when the UNSC is "seized of an 
issue of international peace and security" -- e.g. Iraq -- 
the UNGA should not take up the matter.  Al-Ayed promised to 
convey the points to the minister, but noted that Jordan 
would be hard pressed to take a position different from the 
Arab Bloc consensus.
