REF: A. STATE 209690 
     ¶B. KUWAIT 3256 
     ¶C. ABU DHABI 3389 
 
¶1.  Kuwait notes Ref C request that due to staff limitations, 
Abu Dhabi asks MEPI-funded contractors Emad Tinawi and Lori 
Brock to delay their proposed visit to the UAE until 9-12 
August.  That rescheduling would leave a 3-5 August hole in 
the MEPI team's travel plans. 
 
¶2. Similarly, Kuwait has a staff shortage during the proposed 
1-3 August visit here.  DCM, Econ Chief and SCO will be out 
of country.  There is no Econ backup during Summer rotation. 
FCS is understaffed and its chief FSN on annual leave. 
 
¶3.  In order to have an uninterrupted and productive travel 
schedule that best fits to Posts' staff limitations, the MEPI 
team could benefit by starting its travel with Saudi Arabia, 
as scheduled now, followed by UAE and then the others. 
 
¶4. Please advise.
