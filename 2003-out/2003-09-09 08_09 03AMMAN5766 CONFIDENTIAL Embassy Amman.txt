SUBJECT: GROUP OF JORDANIAN MP'S ASKS GOVERNMENT TO OPPOSE 
ATTENDANCE OF IRAQI GOVERNING COUNCIL AT AL MINISTERIAL 
 
 
Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (b)(d) 
 
¶1.  (U)  Thirty two members of the lower house of the 
Jordanian Parliament (MPs) have sent a petition to the 
government asking that Jordan oppose the seating of 
"representatives of American occupation" -- that is, the 
Iraqi Governing Council (GC) -- at the upcoming Arab League 
(AL) Ministerial meeting in Cairo.  The petition argues that 
the GC should not participate because the AL charter permits 
membership only to independent states and "Iraq is occupied 
by the Americans, according to UN Resolution 1483." 
 
¶2.  (U)  Jordanian Information Minister Nabil Sharif told the 
press that the GOJ respects the MPs' opinion, but is still in 
consultation with other Arab states on the issue.  "We want 
to come up with a position that is acceptable to other Arab 
states," he said.  Sharif noted that the AL could follow the 
example if the UN Security Council, which had permitted a GC 
representative to attend a SC meeting as an observer. 
 
¶3.  (C)  King Abdullah, PM Abul Ragheb, and MFA officials 
tell us that they will work to see GC reps seated at the AL 
Ministerial to speed Iraq's re-integration into the Arab 
mainstream. 
 
¶4.  (C)  COMMENT:  Since only 32 of the 110 MPs signed the 
petition, it is unlikely to influence the GOJ's position at 
the AL Ministerial.  However, this and other possible 
Parliamentary objections to GOJ policy -- especially if 
phrased in populist terms that condemn "occupation" -- could 
lead the GOJ to be more cautious in its public support for 
the GC. 
 
¶5.  (U)  CPA Baghdad minimize considered.
