called on FM Qirbi to deliver ref a demarche, which Charge 
noted was a follow-up to discussions with President Saleh by 
both U/S Bolton and NEA A/S Burns (ref c), as well as 
Ambassador's meeting with Defense Minister Aliwa (ref b). 
Other topics from the meeting are reported septels. 
 
¶2. (S) Qirbi stated repeatedly that Saleh had made clear 
Yemen,s policy, i.e. that there would be no further 
cooperation with North Korea.  There will be no new 
contracts, said Qirbi, stressing also that Yemen would make 
no/no payment of any sort to North Korea.  Rather, he said, 
the ROYG is attempting to extract from the North Koreans full 
service -- i.e. the missile repairs -- for "money already 
paid which we cannot get back from them."  He observed in 
passing that U.S. compensation could simplify the issue. 
Qirbi concluded with a promise to confer with the Ministry of 
Finance and convey a further reply after the impending 
government closure for the eid al-fitr holiday.
