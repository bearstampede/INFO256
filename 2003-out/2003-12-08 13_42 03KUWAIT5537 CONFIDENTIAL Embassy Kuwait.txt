On December 8, Acting Head of the Central Bank of Kuwait's 
Anti-Money Laundering Unit Talal Alsayegh informed EconOff 
that the Government of Kuwait has decided to transfer the $85 
million in Iraq assets frozen in the Bahamas to the DFI (via 
the Kuwaiti mission at the UN).   Alsayegh said that the 
joint Central Bank/MFA investigatory team has also determined 
that additional Iraqi funds currently held in Kuwaiti banks 
must be transferred, although he did not specify the exact 
amounts.  Post will inform the Department of the specifics as 
soon as they are available.
