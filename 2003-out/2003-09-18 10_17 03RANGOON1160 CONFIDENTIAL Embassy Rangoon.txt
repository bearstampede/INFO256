(C) Sources in Rangoon have offered support for a BBC report 
from September 18th that National League for Democracy leader 
Aung San Suu Kyi was taken to a private Rangoon clinic late 
on September 17th.  According to these sources, she was taken 
to the clinic for a routine outpatient gynecological 
procedure.  The sources agreed with the BBC's reporting that 
the procedure was completed without complications.  We were 
unable to ascertain for certain whether ASSK had been 
released from the hospital or whether she was still 
recovering there.  A close associate of ASSK's said that a 
medical "bulletin" updating her condition would be released 
widely on September 19th.
