Â¶1. (SBU) Per reftel, we delivered demarche to the GOAM 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs urging their support for Costa 
Rica's resolution calling for an international instrument to 
ban all forms of human cloning.  The United Nations Desk 
Officer said that he could not say today how Armenia would 
vote, but that there were discussions of the issue with 
Armenia's Ambassador to the United Nations, who is currently 
in Yerevan, and they would know tonight or tomorrow.  The 
last time this issue was up for a vote, Armenia supported 
Iran's resolution to defer any consideration of a ban on 
human cloning for two years.
