¶3. (U)  On March 26, Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan 
Muasher commented to Al-Jazeera on the recent criticism by 
the Iraqi regime of Jordan's move to expel three Iraqi 
"diplomats".  Muasher said he "expressed his regret" at a 
letter sent by the Iraqi Foreign Minister to the GOJ, saying 
that the letter "does not live up to the relations between 
Jordan and Iraq nor to the personal relation between (Iraqi 
FM) Naji Sabri and myself."  Hoping that the matter is not 
"blown out of proportion," Muasher reiterated the GOJ 
position that the expelled "diplomats" were a security risk 
and were not expelled as a result of USG pressure.
