SUBJECT:  DONOR STRATEGY - AFGHANISTAN 
 
REF: A) STATE 305542, B) ABU DHABI 3940 
 
(U) Classified by CDA Richard Albright, for reasons 1.5 B 
and d. 
 
¶1. (C) Post understands that, in meetings last week with 
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for Foreign 
Affairs Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al-Nahyan (HbZ), Treasury 
Secretary Snow and Defense Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz urged 
 
SIPDIS 
HbZ to expedite disbursal of pledged UAE assistance to 
Afghanistan and to pledge and deliver additional assistance 
on an urgent basis.  In response, HbZ promised to send an 
Abu Dhabi Fund for Development team to review project needs 
with Afghan government ministries after Ramadan. 
 
¶2. (C) Post has followed up with contacts at the Ministry 
of Finance and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development to 
determine the status of the $36 million pledge that the UAE 
made in 2002 ($30 million of which was for project 
assistance and administered by the Fund and $6 million of 
which was humanitarian assistance).  According to Abu Dhabi 
Fund Senior Assistant Director General Ahmed Baqer, the 
Fund is currently evaluating two development projects 
requested by the Afghan government.  He suggested that the 
Afghans have not provided the UAEG with enough prioritized 
projects for the Fund to evaluate.  He further stated that 
he would like to see at least 5 or 6 proposals, so the UAEG 
would have some choice.  Baqer did not seem aware that the 
UAEG had agreed to provide $10 million, of the $30 million, 
in direct cash assistance to the GoA. (ref B)  We are 
trying to confirm whether this $10 million has been 
transferred. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  The Abu Dhabi Fund is the development 
arm of the Abu Dhabi Government.  As such it either lends 
out its own money or manages Abu Dhabi grants if these 
involve development projects.  It does not provide 
humanitarian assistance or other types of grants, so it 
only handles a portion of UAE assistance worldwide.  Of the 
approximately 108 billion Dirhams ($29 billion) in 
assistance that the UAE has provided since 1972, only about 
19 billion Dirhams ($5 billion) have gone through the Fund. 
We note, for example, that the UAEG also provided a $50 
million assistance-in-kind package to the Afghan national 
army in November 2002 and continued substantial 
humanitarian support to Afghanistan.  End Comment
