SUBJECT: HOLY SEE ON ICJ, ISRAELI SEPARATION BARRIER 
 
REF: A. A) SECSTATE 325119 
     ¶B. B) VATICAN 5190 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JIM NICHOLSON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (C) POLOFF DELIVERED REFTEL POINTS TO HOLY SEE OFFICE 
DIRECTOR FOR ISRAEL AND PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS FRANCO COPPOLA 
NOVEMBER 25.  COPPOLA LIMITED HIS RESPONSE TO THE POSSIBILITY 
    OF AN INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ) OPINION ON THE 
LEGALITY OF THE ISRAELI SEPARATION BARRIER.  HE AGREED THAT 
SEEKING AN ICJ OPINION WOULD BE A MISTAKE THAT WOULD RISK 
POLITICIZING THE ICJ, AND IN GENERAL WOULD COMPLICATE THE 
SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. 
 
¶2. (C) COPPOLA SAID THE HOLY SEE APPRECIATED AND WELCOMED THE 
PRESIDENT'S SIGNIFICANT NOVEMBER 19 COMMENTS IN LONDON 
REGARDING THE WAY FORWARD IN THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN DISPUTE 
(REF A).  HE POINTEDLY NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE COMMENTS 
SEEMED TO HAVE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT. 
THE HOLY SEE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE GOI MAY IN FACT NOW BE 
SPEEDING UP CONSTRUCTION OF THE BARRIER.  IF THE GOI DOES NOT 
RESPOND EVEN TO THE U.S. CRITICISM, COPPOLA OBSERVED, PERHAPS 
SOMETHING MORE CONCRETE NEEDED TO BE DONE. 
 
¶3. (C) THE HOLY SEE'S CONCERN ABOUT THE SECURITY FENCE -- AS 
HIGHLIGHTED BY THE POPE'S POINTED REMARKS IN HIS LAST SUNDAY 
ANGELUS ADDRESS (REF B) -- WAS THAT THE FURTHER ALONG THE 
BARRIER PROJECT WENT, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO 
REVERSE IT.  THE HOLY SEE BELIEVES THE PROJECT WILL ONLY 
SERVE TO EMPOWER EXTREMISTS, AND WILL ONLY HINDER THE PEACE 
PROCESS.  THE ICJ IS NOT THE ANSWER, COPPOLA AGREED, BUT WE 
MUST FIND ANOTHER WAY.

¶4. (C) THE POPE'S UNUSUAL DIRECT AND PUBLIC CRITICISM OF THE 
SECURITY WALL EVOKED A SHARP RESPONSE FROM PRIME MINISTER 
    SHARON DURING HIS VISIT TO ITALY LAST WEEK IN WHICH HE NOTED 
THAT HE COULD NOT HELP BUT NOTICE THAT THE VATICAN WAS 
SURROUNDED BY WALLS.  THERE HAD BEEN PRESS SPECULATION ABOUT 
WHETHER SHARON WOULD MEET WITH THE POPE DURING HIS THREE DAYS 
IN ROME, BUT THE POPE'S CRITICISM DIMMED ANY PROSPECTS FOR 
SUCH A MEETING.  WE HAVE HEARD THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN ISRAEL 
AND THE HOLY SEE ARE AT A LOW POINT -- AN IMPRESSION 
REINFORCED BY SHARON'S' STUDIOUS AVOIDANCE OF VATICAN CITY 
DURING HIS VISIT AND BY ISRAEL'S DOWNSIZING OF ITS MISSION TO 
THE HOLY SEE IN RECENT MONTHS.  COPPOLA'S CALL FOR SOMETHING 
BEYOND EXHORTATION TO ISRAEL IS A REFLECTION OF THE HOLY 
SEE'S MOUNTING FRUSTRATION BOTH WITH THE CONTINUING CYCLE OF 
VIOLENCE AND ISRAELI POLICY ON THE BARRIER AND SETTLEMENTS.
