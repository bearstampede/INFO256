NOMINATING-OFFICER: Bruce A. Lohof 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Mr. Athas is a very senior journalist in the Sri Lankan 
print media who has specialized as a defence 
correspondent.  He regularly contributes to the widely 
read defence column in "The Sunday Times" newspaper. 
In addition to being the defence correspondent, he is 
also the Consultant Editor of this paper. 
During the prolonged ethnic strife in Sri Lanka he 
received threats from certain elements in the Armed 
Services who did not take too kind to the revelations 
in his column. 
Recognizing his contributions in the field of 
journalism New York-based Committee to Protect 
Journalists (CPJ) awarded him the prestigious Press 
Freedom Award in 1994.  The Editors' Guild of Sri Lanka 
awarded him the 'Journalist of the Year 1998', and the 
'Columnist of the Year 2001'.  He is the only Sri 
Lankan journalist invited as a member in the 
International Consortium of Investigative Journalists 
(ICIJ). 
Mr. Athas is visiting the U.S. to attend the 
Investigative Reporters and Editors Annual Conference 
to be held in  Washington from June 5-8 at the National 
Press Club.  As a target of opportunity, post proposes 
a 10-day funded Volvis program for this highly 
respected Sri Lankan journalist on governmental affairs 
and security issues.  Post believes that this proposed 
Volvis program would provide him with a wide exposure 
to U.S. government and its policies especially in 
defense, national security, foreign policy, and anti- 
terrorism.  This will result in multiplier effect as he 
will use the newly acquired knowledge in his widely 
read column.  If this proposal is accepted, Mr. Athas 
will be available for programming in Washington from 
June 9.
