SUBJECT: UAE DRAFTS LABOR UNION REGULATIONS 
 
¶1. (U) The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs completed 
the final draft of a proposal permitting the creation of 
full-fledged labor unions, on 2/24.  The plan will be 
reviewed by the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of 
Justice, Islamic Affairs and Awqaf before a final proposal 
is submitted to the Cabinet. After approval by the Cabinet, 
the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs will enact a bylaw 
to institute the new policy.  The Ministry will also 
establish a new department responsible for handling matters 
related to labor unions. 
 
¶2. (U) Under the draft proposal, the Labour Ministry will 
establish membership conditions for new unions.  A worker is 
defined as a "person who works in a public or private 
organization and gets paid for his work."  Groups of twenty 
or more nationals working in a profession or trade will be 
permitted to organize to protect their rights and interests. 
Organizations will be allowed to join Arab or international 
trade unions and the proposal also refers to the possibility 
of establishing a unified labor federation in the UAE. 
Expatriate laborers working in the UAE for more than six 
years will be allowed to join as associate members but will 
not be permitted to vote or contest elections. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: The draft proposal by the Labour Ministry 
is another step in the right direction by the UAEG to bring 
domestic labor laws into conformity with international 
standards.  While workers here continue to have considerable 
rights of association -- and there have even been strikes 
(often by expatriates over non-payment of wages) -- these 
new proposals will officially ensure workers' rights to 
organize and bargain collectively. The Embassy will follow- 
up with the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs on the 
draft proposal and monitor its movement through the 
government.
