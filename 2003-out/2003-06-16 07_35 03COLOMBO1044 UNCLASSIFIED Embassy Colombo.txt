NOMINATING-OFFICER: Will Avery 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Mr. Tennakoon is one of the more promising younger 
politicians of the Peoples Alliance (PA).  He has 
strong ties to Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), as his 
father and grandfather were both prominent MP and 
Minister, respectively, in previous SLFP governments. 
Mr. Tennakoon has been active in politics from 1997. 
He entered politics from the Pradeshiya Sabha of a 
Kandy district village in 1997.  He was the provincial 
health and sports minister from 1999-2001 in the 
Central Provincial Council (CPC).  He is a well-known 
figure in the Kandy district, as he was the President 
of the Kandy District Cricket Association.  During his 
tenure at CPC he engaged in hospital development, water 
and sports development projects. 
Mr. Tennakoon, with his popularity in the Kandy 
District and strong family background within the SLFP, 
is likely to have a promising political career.  He is 
in a position to understand business issues, as he 
worked at a commercial entity (Sri Lankan Airlines) and 
held positions with the District Cricket 
Administration.  It is in the interest of the mission 
to cultivate interlocutors in the PA who will 
understand US economic perspectives, so that we have 
representation in Parliament and the provinces who will 
be able to support US views.  His education was in Sri 
Lanka and Russia.  We expect that an exposure to the US 
economic model will be an eye opener for him.
