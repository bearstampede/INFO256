SUBJECT: INITIAL DUTCH RESPONSE ON REQUEST FOR EOD TROOPS 
OR PERSONNEL IN IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 283779 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Mary E. Daly for reasons 1.5 (b and 
d) 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see Para. 2. 
 
¶2. (S) On October 6, PolOff delivered reftel demarche on 
Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) to Rob Gabrielse, Head of 
the MFA's Security Policy Bureau Operations Office. 
Gabrielse said the GONL recognizes the threat posed by 
unexploded ammunition, and the broader need for EOD assets. 
However, before the GONL can decide whether to provide EOD 
troops or personnel to the Dutch operations area (Al Muthanna 
province) in Iraq, the GONL requests answers to several 
questions: 
a) what is the official CPA policy regarding the guarding of 
caches and the disposal or deactivation of the ammunition 
b) what are the problems in the Dutch sector of Iraq, 
specifically the extent of the EOD problem and the recent 
history of EOD personnel there. 
Action Request: Post seeks Department feedback on these two 
points for use with the GONL ASAP. 
 
¶3. (S) Gabrielse said the Dutch are currently exploring a 
demining partnership with Jordan, and an exploratory military 
mission is going to Jordan this week to look into 
possibilities.  The Dutch will wait for the results of the 
Jordan mission before a political decision is made.
