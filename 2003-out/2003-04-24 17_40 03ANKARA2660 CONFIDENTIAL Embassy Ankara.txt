Ward for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
 
¶2. (U) This cable contains action requests for the 
Department/CENTCOM. 
See paras 9 and 10. 
 
 
¶3. (C) Summary:  MFA has delayed the Turkish Red Crescent's 
planned delivery 
of aid to Iraq to April 28, but expanded it from medicines 
only to include 
food and water.  Media and parliamentarians may travel with 
the convoy, 
which is not approved by the ICRC.  MFA has asked whether it 
can or 
should provide its own military security for the convoy.  The 
Turkish Red 
Crescent informed ICRC separately of the shipment.  Embassy 
requests that 
preliminary information on the convoy be passed to the HOC, 
CMOC and DART. 
End Summary. 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) On April 24, Feza Ozturk, MFA Head of Department for 
International 
Political Organizations, told Mission Disaster Relief Officer 
(MDRO) that 
MFA and the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) had decided to 
postpone to the 
early morning of April 28 and to expand the scope of the 
proposed aid 
shipment for Iraq (ref A).  The Turks plan to send a total of 
12 vehicles 
(5 trucks, 4 ambulances, 2 communications vehicles, 1 
Volkswagen minibus) 
carrying medical supplies, food, and water to hospitals in 
Mosul and Kirkuk. 
Up to 28 persons, including two (unidentified) members of 
Parliament and at 
least one media representative (from TRT - state 
radio/television), will 
travel in the convoy.  MFA anticipates a one or two day 
presence in Iraq, 
except for the ambulances and their staff which might stay on 
for three to 
four days.  Ozturk stated frankly that this would be done 
with or without 
the approval of the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC), though 
he said that MFA would inform the ICRC of its plans.  He 
related that this 
decision had been made by the Prime Minister.  MFA will send 
complete details 
to Embassy on this convoy by April 25. 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) MDRO advised Ozturk that neither the Disaster 
Assistance Response 
Team (DART) nor the Civil Military Operations Center (CMOC) 
were prepared 
to identify hospitals in need of medical supplies at this 
point, and that 
they strongly recommended coordination of aid with the ICRC. 
He also passed 
on the DART/CMOC assessment that areas north/east of the 
green line were 
permissive, as is Kirkuk.  Mosul is not currently fully 
permissive. 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) MDRO asked Ozturk whether the donors had verified 
that Mosul and 
Kirkuk hospitals were in need of and willing to accept these 
supplies. 
Ozturk responded that MFA had not checked, but would do so. 
However, he 
stated that he assumed that all hospitals in Iraq were in 
need of this 
kind of aid. Note:  Ozturk did not identify the hospitals by 
name, but 
said that the convoy would deliver all materials to the 
"largest state 
hospitals" in Mosul and Kirkuk. 
 
 
¶7. (C) Security:  Ozturk reiterated Turkey's offer to provide 
its own 
security (Turkish Special Forces) for the convoy if the U.S. 
side believed 
that the situation surrounding this aid shipment was not 
secure.  Ozturk 
also stated that the Turkish side would inform the KDP and 
PUK of its 
intention to send this convoy.  MDRO responded that he would 
check this 
"offer" with Task Force North and get back to MFA.  Task 
Force North 
maintains that no Turkish military forces of any kind should 
enter Iraq 
to escort the convoy.  MDRO will report this to MFA on April 
¶28. 
 
 
¶8. (SBU) ICRC's View:  Finn Ruda, ICRC Regional 
Representative, told MDRO 
that ICRC had offered the Turks several options for delivery 
of aid through 
ICRC channels during the week of April 28, but that TRC 
preferred to go it 
alone.  However, Ruda was informed that TRC planned to send 
its convoy on 
April 25.  Note:  MDRO subsequently confirmed that TRC plans 
to send the 
convoy April 28, not/not April 25.  End Note. 
 
 
Action Requests: 
---------------- 
 
 
¶9. (U) Embassy requests that information on this convoy be 
shared with the 
Humanitarian Operations Center in Kuwait, as well as the CMOC 
and DART team 
in northern Iraq. 
 
 
¶10. (C) We note in ref C information that CENTCOM would 
support efforts by 
other coalition partners to "adopt" hospitals in Iraq and ask 
whether CENTCOM 
can recommend a hospital to be paired with the Turks.
