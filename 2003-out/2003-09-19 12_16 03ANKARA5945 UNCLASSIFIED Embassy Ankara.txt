EDITORIAL OPINION 
"Sending troops to Iraq" 
Cengiz Candar opined in mass appeal DB-Tercuman (9/18): "The 
U.S. Administration, concerned about the upcoming elections 
and the rising cost of the Iraq bill, is planning to bring 
troops to Iraq from Muslim Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and 
India. .  Even conservative Republicans point to the 
possibility that the Bush Administration's Iraq policy might 
end up as a fiasco. .  They believe that Iraq's Sunni/Arab 
zone, which is to be left under Turkish peacekeepers' 
mandate, will become a safe haven for the Baath Party 
supporters. .  Republican conservatives warn that Bush will 
suffer a significant loss of votes if the U.S. brings 
`improper' peacekeepers to Iraq.  After his meetings in 
Iraq, Secretary Powell had qualified the issue of Turkish 
troops in the region as `sensitive.'" 
 
 
"Orientalist rhetoric on Iraq" 
Akif Emre wrote in the Islamist intellectual Yeni Safak 
(9/18): "Americans' occupation of Iraq not only targeted the 
physical resources of the region, but also aimed at 
destroying the memory of a civilization that goes beyond 
Iraq's borders. .  The U.S. has brought back to the region 
something unseen in American history - colonialism. .  The 
main question that should be posed regarding Iraq is the 
number of civilians who have lost their lives under 
occupation. .  Robert Fisk says that about 1000 Iraqi 
civilians are killed every week. .  A large majority of 
these Iraqis are killed by American soldiers during raids or 
at checkpoints.  Panicky Americans pull the trigger without 
much thinking while fighting the Iraqis. .  Is there an 
international institution to define this humanitarian crime? 
.  Our government said it would not become a police force 
for the Americans in Iraq.  Who are we going to protect in 
Iraq - the American troops there, or the Iraqi people from 
the American troops?"
