SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR RAISES MLAT AND TIP WITH 
MINISTER OF JUSTICE AL-DHAHERI 
 
 
¶1.  MLAT: The Ambassador, accompanied by Polchief 
and POL FSN, met 5/31 with UAE Minister of Justice, 
Awqaf and Islamic Affairs Muhammad Nakhira Al- 
Dhaheri.  The Ambassador engaged Al-Dhaheri on the 
draft Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, noting that, 
following the exchange of proposed changes, the 
U.S. was prepared to begin negotiations in the near 
future.  The Ambassador proposed a discussion of 
preliminary matters via video teleconference.  Al- 
Dhaheri agreed on the need to proceed, but asked 
that the VTC incorporate a discussion of 
longstanding and unmet UAE requests to the USG 
related to judicial matters.  The Ambassador 
demurred that such a discussion should occur in a 
separate forum.  (Note:  We will meet with Ministry 
of Justice officials to ascertain the nature of 
these concerns.) 
 
¶2.  EXTRADITION TREATY:  The Minister expressed the 
UAEG's desire to move forward with negotiations on 
a draft extradition treaty concurrent with MLAT 
negotiations.  The Ambassador, noting the minor 
changes to the MLAT suggested by both sides, hoped 
that we could conclude that agreement and then open 
discussions on an extradition treaty.  The Minister 
took the Ambassador's point on board. 
 
¶3.  TIP:  The Ambassador asked the Minister for an 
update on the status of the draft law criminalizing 
the use of underage camel jockeys.  Al-Dhaheri 
briefed that the legislation is with the Supreme 
Council of Rulers pending the signature of the 
rulers of all seven emirates.  Once the other six 
emirate rulers have signed, the legislation will be 
sent to UAE President and Abu Dhabi Ruler Zayid bin 
Sultan Al-Nahyan's office for his signature.  With 
Zayid's signature, the legislation becomes law. 
Al-Dhaheri could not predict how long the process 
would take, but did not expect it to be too drawn 
out.
