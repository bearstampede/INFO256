SUBJECT: UAE READY FOR MLAT VIDEO CONFERENCE JULY 15 
 
REF 7/9/03 Deeks- Menard e-mail 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by A/DCM Katherine Van De Vate, for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (U) This is an Action request.  Please see para 5. 
 
¶3.  (C) The Ambassador Met with UAE Minister of Justice, 
Islamic Affairs, and Awqaf Mohamed Nakhera Al-Daheri on 
July 13, 2003.  The Minister said that of the 3 dates 
proposed (July 15 and 16, August 11) for a digital 
videoconference on the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty 
(MLAT), the UAE preferred July 15.  Due to summer travel 
schedules, the UAE will not be able to make an August date. 
 
¶4. (U) The UAEG is proposing a 1945 (local) start time - 
1145 Washington time.  Note:  We have talked to the 
technicians responsible for setting up the conference and 
they are looking to connect at 1930 (local). 
 
¶5. (U) Comment and Action Request:  The UAEG is eager to 
talk, but given the summer schedule here, there is a small 
window of opportunity before the fall that we want to take 
advantage of.  Please arrange for a translator in 
Washington.  Many of the UAEG participants do not have a 
good command of English.  The UAEG will try to provide a 
translator here as well. End Comment and Action Request
