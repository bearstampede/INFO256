MISSION TO THE UN AGENCIES, ROME. BEGIN QUOTE: 
 
THE PRESIDENT 
THE WHITE HOUSE 
WASHINGTON, DC  20500 
 
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: 
 
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION TO 
FEEDING THE HUNGRY AND HELPING THOSE LESS FORTUNATE.  MY 
WHOLE STAFF AND I WERE GREATLY ENCOURAGED BY YOUR STATEMENT 
IN THE STATE OF THE UNION ABOUT HOW GENEROUS AMERICA IS IN 
FEEDING THE WORLD.  IT IS SOMETHING I SAY ALL THE TIME. 
AS YOU KNOW, YOUR PROPOSAL FOR A FAMINE FUND AND THE 
EMERGENCY PLAN FOR AIDS RELIEF COULD NOT COME AT A BETTER 
TIME.  MORE THAN 38 MILLION PEOPLE ARE THREATENED BY 
STARVATION IN AFRICA ALONE, AND THAT SITUATION IS EVEN MORE 
COMPLEX BECAUSE OF THE AIDS PANDEMIC.  IN ALL OF MY YEARS 
WORKING TO FIGHT HUNGER, I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY SERIOUS 
CRISES DEMANDING SO MUCH ASSISTANCE AT ONCE.  I AM HEADED 
BACK TO ETHIOPIA WHERE I EXPECT TO FIND CHILDREN STARVING, 
AS I DID WHEN I WENT IN 1984. 
 
I KNOW THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT DEMAND YOUR TIME AND 
ATTENTION, BUT I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I 
APPRECIATE YOUR HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
DO OUR BEST TO PUT INTO ACTION AMERICA'S COMMITMENT TO 
ALLEVIATE HUNGER AND BUILD HOPE, THROUGH COMMUNICATING AND 
DEMONSTRATING AMERICA'S COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE IN NEED. 
 
WHILE I HOPE THAT OUR ALLIES IN THE G-8 RESPOND TO YOUR 
INITIATIVE AND CREATE OTHER FAMINE FUNDS, EVEN IF YOU DON'T 
GET CREDIT ON EARTH, YOU WILL IN HEAVEN. 

 
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL THAT YOU'RE DOING ON BEHALF OF THE 
POOR AND HUNGRY.  GOD BLESS. 
 
SINCERELY, TONY P. HALL AMBASSADOR.  END QUOTE.
