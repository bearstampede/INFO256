SUBJECT: TFIZ01: ITALY TO ESTABLISH IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION 
TASK FORCE 
 
    REF: A. STATE 65142 
     ¶B. ROME 1217 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: ECON M/C SCOTT KILNER, REASONS 1.5 (B, D) 
 
¶1.  (C) IN A MARCH 21 MEETING WITH POL MINCOUNS AND ECONOFF, 
ANTONIO BADINI, THE ITALIAN MFA'S DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR THE 
MIDDLE EAST, SAID THAT HE WOULD ESTABLISH AN INTER-AGENCY 
TASK FORCE ON IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION FOLLOWING HIS TRIP THIS 
WEEK TO WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK.  BADINI HAS YET TO ESTABLISH 
THE FINANCIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TASK 
FORCE BUT IS LOOKING TO HIS MEETINGS IN THE U.S. AS A WAY TO 
LEARN FROM THE USG'S "METHODOLOGY" OF COORDINATING IRAQ 
RECONSTRUCTION.  BADINI DESCRIBED THE GOI'S INTEREST IN BROAD 
ENGAGEMENT OVER THE NEAR- AND MEDIUM-TERM TO INCLUDE 
POST-CONFLICT SUPPORT, HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND EVENTUALLY 
COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS. 
 
¶2.  (C) WHILE BADINI DID NOT SPECIFY AMOUNTS OF MONETARY 
ASSISTANCE, HE DID MENTION THAT SPECIAL FINANCIAL MEASURES 
WOULD BE TAKEN TO SECURE NECESSARY FUNDS.  MEANWHILE, BADINI 
WAS SUPPORTIVE REGARDING SUCH GOI CONTRIBUTIONS OF 
SPECIALISTS IN BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS AS MIGHT BE 
NEEDED IN THE IMMEDIATE POST-WAR PHASE (REF A), SAYING "WE 
SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THAT FOR SURE."  BADINI ALSO AGREED ON 
THE NEED TO BE ATTENTIVE TO TURKEY'S PRIOR COMMITMENT TO 
RESPECT THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF IRAQ.  BADINI ALSO 
SHARED HIS PARTICULAR INTEREST IN ENCOURAGING STRONGER USG 
ENGAGEMENT WITH, AND REASSURANCES FOR, IRAN AND SYRIA 
(REPORTED SEPTEL, REF B). 
 
    ¶3.  (C) COMMENT: BADINI CLEARLY WANTS TO USE HIS VISIT TO 
WASHINGTON ON MARCH 24 AND 25 AND TO NEW YORK ON MARCH 26 AND 
27 AS A POINT OF DEPARTURE FOR BUILDING THE GOI'S IRAQ 
RECONSTRUCTION TASK FORCE IN SUCH A WAY AS TO INTERFACE 
EFFECTIVELY WITH USG AND UN ORGANIZATIONS.  HE IS EAGER TO 
LEARN FROM OUR OWN COORDINATION EFFORTS AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW 
ITALY CAN HELP IN A RANGE OF AREAS FROM NON-COMBAT TROOPS TO 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO SALVAGING FORMER COMMERCIAL 
CONTRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED IN RECENT YEARS.  BADINI 
MADE CLEAR THAT HE WANTED TO BE SURE THAT ITALIAN INTERESTS 
WERE FAIRLY REPRESENTED IN THE POST-WAR PERIOD, ALBEIT IN A 
WAY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH IRAQ'S POST-WAR DEVELOPMENT 
NEEDS.  END COMMENT.
