Polmiloff met MFA Disarmament Second Secretary Aykut 
Kumbaroglu on April 16 and delivered ref a demarche. 
Kumbaroglu welcomed the clarification on Iran's nuclear 
program and promised to convey the information at once to the 
Turkish Mission in Vienna as well as other relevant GOT 
offices.  Kumbaroglu agreed that Iran's becoming a party to 
the Additional Protocol would be a "positive step," but by no 
means indicated transparent compliance or proof of Iran 
having abandoned its nuclear weapons program.  He both hopes 
and expects the IAEA will seek a more complete clarification 
about Iran's program and continue to monitor the situation on 
an urgent basis.  Kumbaroglu said that Turkey's non-permament 
term on the IAEA Board will expire in 2003 and that Ankara 
hopes the USG will continue to share as much information 
about Iran's nuclear efforts as it can.
