  Â¶1.   Secretary of State Colin Powell's February 5 
      presentation to the UN Security Council was barely 
      visible in the Zimbabwean media.  An AFP report 
      published on page 4 of the government-owned "Herald" 
      and a wire service-based report read on the government- 
      owned Zimbabwean Broadcasting Corporation morning 
      television news program, are the sum total of local 
      mention of the Secretary's presentation.  There is no 
      editorial or op-ed reaction to the presentation.
