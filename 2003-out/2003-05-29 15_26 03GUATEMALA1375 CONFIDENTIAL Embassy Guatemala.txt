SUBJECT: GUATEMALA MAKES COUNTER REQUEST ON OAS CANDIDATES 
 
REF: A. STATE 141801 
 
     ¶B. GUATEMALA 1340 
 
Classified By: Robert E. Copley for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (U) Per ref A, following up on our previous demarche (ref 
B) and diplomatic note, PolOff discussed post-specific and 
Central American points with Sylvia Corado, Director for 
Multilateral Affairs at the Foreign Ministry on May 28. 
Corado expressed appreciation for our favorable view of Dr. 
Altolaguirre's candidacy and pressed for a commitment of U.S. 
support.  Corado took careful note, without commenting, of 
our view that the Salvadoran candidate is also well qualified 
and of our hope that both the Guatemalan and Salvadoran 
candidates will join us on the IACHR.  Corado then repeated 
the position that Guatemala would vote according to the 
qualifications of the candidates, adding that no decisions 
had been made.  PolOff reviewed the qualifications of the 
U.S. candidates with her. 
 
3 (C) Corado then asked if the U.S. would be willing to 
publicly express support for Jorge Mario Garcia Laguardia, 
Guatemala's candidate for the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights.  Told that the decision would have to be made in 
Washington, Corado hinted that our support for either of 
Guatemala's candidates would likely result in Guatemalan 
support for the U.S. candidates.  Corado added that 
Laguardia's candidacy was Guatemala's priority.  Laguardia 
will accompany the Guatemalan delegation to the OAS General 
Assembly. 
 
¶4. (U) Action request.  Please advise how post should respond 
to the GOG's request for support of their candidates at the 
OASGA.
