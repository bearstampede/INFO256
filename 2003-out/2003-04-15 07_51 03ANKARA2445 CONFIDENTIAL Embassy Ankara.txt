¶1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 5. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) BOTAS Deputy General Manager Fuat Celepci told 
econoff April 15 that the oil flow in the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik 
(Ceyhan) pipeline had stopped completely on April 9, and that 
no tankers had transported crude from Ceyhan since March 20. 
Celepci said that the 6.5 million barrel storage tanks at 
Ceyhan had reached near capacity by the end of March 
(reftel), but a very small quantity had continued to flow 
until the pumps were shut down completely on April 9. 
 
 
¶3. (C) Celepci and MFA DG for Energy Haki Akil both denied 
recent press reports that Turkey had applied to the U.S. or 
the U.N. to sell the Iraqi oil in storage at Ceyhan.  Celepci 
noted that marketing of this oil had never been a GOT 
responsibility.  At this stage, he said, the GOT was waiting 
to see who or what entity would ultimately have the rights to 
sell the oil.  Celepci was not certain whether U.N. workers 
were still present at Ceyhan, but was following up with his 
regional manager there. 
 
 
¶4. (C) Akil asked econoff if the U.S. could provide any 
information on the future of the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline. 
He also asked if there was any truth to press reports that 
the U.S. and the U.K. were supporting a Kirkuk-Haifa oil 
pipeline, which would pass through Jordan and end in the 
Haifa Port of Israel. 
 
 
¶5. (C) Action request:  We would appreciate Department's 
guidance on the questions raised in para 4.
