¶E. O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EINV ETRD ECON EFIN PGOV ZI
SUBJECT: Govt may ax EPZs 
 
 
¶1. Summary: Yesterday's Herald suggests the GOZ may 
eliminate export processing zones (EPZs), taking to the 
next level its obliteration of a once-thriving and 
diversified economy.  End summary. 
 
¶2. The lead article in the State-run Herald's business 
section announces: "EPZs fail to deliver - RBZ [Reserve 
Bank of Zimbabwe]."  In recent weeks, the GOZ has implied 
that firms in EPZs are sheltering foreign exchange from 
Reserve Bank controls.  Although we have not heard 
anything definitive from GOZ sources, the Government 
appears to be laying the groundwork for de-certification 
of EPZs. 
 
¶3. Comment: EPZ companies continue to do well, since they 
are not subject to the GOZ's mandatory exchange 
requirements and take full advantage of an industrious 
workforce at very low wages.  It is one area of this 
plummeting economy that is even drawing new investment. 
Although GOZ statistics are sketchy, we believe most 
Zimbabwean exports to the U.S. now originate in EPZs.  If 
EPZ companies must comply with present export 
regulations, most will no longer operate competitively.
