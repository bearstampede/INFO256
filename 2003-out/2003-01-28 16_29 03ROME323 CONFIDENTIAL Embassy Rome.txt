(C) ON JAN. 27, FRANCESCO TRUPIANO, THE MOD DIPLOMATIC 
ADVISOR, REPORTED TO POLMIL OFFICER THAT ITALY DOES NOT 
CURRENTLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THE USG REQUEST TO 
PROVIDE REPLACEMENTS FOR US MEDICAL FORCES IN THE MFO (REF 
A.)  TRUPIANO STRESSED THAT THE GOI STUDIED THE USG REQUEST 
VERY CAREFULLY.  HOWEVER, TRUPIANO SAID THAT THE GOI, FOR THE 
TIME BEING, IS UNABLE TO SUPPORT OUR MFO REQUEST SINCE THE 
GOI: 
-- ALREADY COMMITS 10,000 PERSONNEL TO INTERNATIONAL 
PEACEKEEPING AND HUMANITARIAN MISSIONS, MOSTLY IN THE BALKANS 
AND THE MIDDLE EAST. 
-- IS COMMITTING 1,000 ALPINI TROOPS TO OEF. 
-- NEEDS TO RESERVE SOME OF ITS FORCES AND ASSETS FOR 
NATIONAL CONTINGENCIES RANGING FROM DISASTER RELIEF TO 
HOMELAND SECURITY.
