NOMINATING-OFFICER: Joe Novak 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Mr. Amitirigala is well versed in the Sri Lankan legal 
system and is a lecturer on the topic at the Sri Lanka 
Law College.  In his role as a lecturer he will have an 
influence on Sri Lanka's future attorneys and judges. 
In his current position he is proving himself a 
knowledgeable contact on what is happening in Sri 
Lanka's judicial circles.  On a personal level he is 
trying to expand his knowledge on human rights issues 
as they relate to the law.  An IV grant would not only 
strengthen Mission's ties to this contact, but it would 
also give the USG the opportunity to help direct his 
interests into the human rights field.
