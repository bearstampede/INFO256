¶1.     (SBU) The Dutch government says it will not/not seek 
to influence decisions on the Passenger Name Record/data 
privacy matter at the European Commission, instead relying on 
the judgment of Commissioner Bolkestein and trusting in the 
competency of the bodies in Brussels that are tasked with 
examining the privacy issue.  This information comes from 
Andre van Wiggen of the MFA's Division of Transport in a 
follow-up conversation to post's September 9 demarche (ref 
B).  Van Wiggen says the issue "has our highest attention." 
The MFA says it is difficult to predict what Bolkestein will 
do as he is "holding his cards close to his chest." 
 
¶2.     (SBU) Van Wiggen's office leads GONL interagency 
consultations on PNR/data privacy matters.  There is at this 
time no consensus among Ministries on the subject.  In the 
meantime, the Ministries of Justice and Transport are 
treading lightly and not issuing any new guidance to the 
airlines.  National carrier KLM is continuing to cooperate in 
meeting USG passenger data requests.
