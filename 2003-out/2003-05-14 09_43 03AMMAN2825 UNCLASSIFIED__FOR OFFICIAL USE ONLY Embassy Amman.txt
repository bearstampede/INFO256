SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED TO JORDAN TO SUBMIT 
AUTHORIZATION REQUEST TO 661 COMMITTEE FOR AIR SERV NGO 
FLIGHT TO IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 126770 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) On May 14, A/PolCouns delivered reftel points to 
Ayman Aimiri, Deputy Director of the MFA's IO Department. 
Aamiri said that he was unfamiliar with AIR SERV's request 
and had not received any message asking for instructions from 
Jordan's Mission in New York on this case.  A/PolCouns 
underlined the urgency and importance of AIR SERV's 
humanitarian flights to the USG and requested Aamiri to 
instruct Jordan's Mission in New York to submit the request 
for authorization today, May 14.  Aamiri promised he would do 
that and did not expect there to be a problem.  Aamiri also 
provided his home and cell phone numbers to A/PolCouns to 
convey to AIR SERV's Amman rep, Ms. Susan MacGregor (who had 
also contacted the Embassy May 14 on the same issue). 
A/PolCouns later spoke with Ms. MacGregor again and verified 
that she had provided Aamiri with details relating to AIR 
SERV's flights from Amman.
