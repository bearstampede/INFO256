SUBJECT:  DART ASSESSMENT OF AL AMARAH 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  DART Field Team South traveled to the southeastern Iraqi 
Governorate of Maysan on 7 May to assess security along the 
main highway from Basrah to Al Amarah and within the city of 
Al Amarah itself.  During the trip, the DART met with 
Coalition forces based in and around the city.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
DART SECURITY ASSESSMENT 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  Six DART members, including two translators, traveled 
along Route 6, the principal highway northward from the 
southeastern city of Basrah to Al Amarah, a city of 
approximately 250,000 people.  The route is 154 kilometers 
and consists of a four-lane, divided highway that roughly 
follows the western bank of the Tigris River. 
 
¶3.  According to the United Nations Security Coordinator 
(UNSECOORD) and the British non-governmental organization 
(NGO), Ockenden, large quantities of unexploded ordnance 
(UXO) are located along the route.  During the trip, the 
DART saw some UXO, marked by rocks, along the sides of the 
highway.  A number of abandoned Iraqi military vehicles were 
seen along the route. 
 
¶4.  Coalition forces operating in Maysan Governorate report 
that the local environment is secure and permissive for 
humanitarian operations.  However, they issued the standard 
caveat against traveling at night.  No military escort is 
required in the immediate area of Al Amarah. 
 
¶5.  There was less fighting in the city than in other areas 
of southern Iraq because most loyal Baathist Party members 
fled before the arrival of the Coalition military forces. 
 
--------------------- 
POLICE AND PROTECTION 
--------------------- 
 
¶6.  According to Coalition forces, security, especially at 
night, is still the major concern of Al Amarah residents. 
Coalition forces are trying to address this issue within the 
constraints of limited personnel.  Looting continues to be a 
problem.  Coalition forces are focusing patrols on 
safeguarding key infrastructure. 
 
¶7.  Coalition forces are also training the local police 
force in basic criminal investigation duties and teaching 
them to be more proactive than reactive.  The police force 
is led by the former police chief, a Brigadier who switched 
sides two days before the regime collapsed in Baghdad.  Some 
members of the local police force continue to wear their 
old, military-style, uniforms.  To deter potential abuse and 
corruption, Coalition forces believe that more Coalition 
military police are needed in the city to supervise and 
train a new Iraqi police force. 
 
¶8.  The courthouse in Al Amarah has been extensively 
damaged.  Virtually all documents were destroyed by either 
Baath Party leaders prior to their departure or by the 
looters who followed. 
¶9.  There are reports of mass graves in the area but no 
supporting evidence has been uncovered.  No reprisal crimes 
have been reported.  Some local Baath party members are 
reported under "house arrest." 
 
------------------------------- 
COALITION QUICK IMPACT PROJECTS 
------------------------------- 
 
¶10.  Besides working to re-establish a police force, 
Coalition forces are helping the U.N. World Food Program re- 
establish the Public Distribution System for food rations 
and get the local grain elevator and silos working. 
Coalition forces plan to provide public transportation for 
teachers and students. 
 
¶11.  To help the local economy, Coalition forces paid an 
estimated 17,500 civil servants in Al Amarah the equivalent 
of USD 20 in Iraqi dinars seized from former government 
accounts in three local banks. 
 
¶12.  The electrical grid provides only intermittent power to 
Al Amarah, and many citizens rely on generators for their 
power.  However, shops are re-opening, markets are busy and 
full of produce, repairs are being made to damaged buildings 
and businesses, and farm workers are harvesting wheat in 
nearby fields.  Children are sweeping the streets and there 
is a lack of rubbish in some areas not seen elsewhere in 
southern Iraqi towns. 
 
¶13.  A high council, or the Secretariat, has been formed 
with local leaders but, according to Coalition forces, it is 
highly politicized.  A second group, the "Regeneration 
Committee" has been created as a group of technical experts 
to help re-establish the city's infrastructure.
