SUBJECT: UAEG SIGNS DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENTS WITH 65 
COUNTRIES; SEEKS TREATY WITH USG 
 
REF: 02 STATE 16509 
 
¶1.  (U) ADDRESSING A SEMINAR ON LEGAL AND TAX ISSUES 
RELATING TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT ON 5/4, UAE MINISTRY OF 
FINANCE UNDERSECRETARY FOR BUDGET AND REVENUE KHALID AL- 
BUSTANI CONFIRMED THAT THE UAEG HAS SIGNED BILATERAL 
AGREEMENTS WITH 65 COUNTRIES ON AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 
AND INCOME TAX.  THESE COUNTRIES INCLUDE A NUMBER OF 
EUROPEAN UNION NATIONS, CANADA, INDIA, AND OTHER MAJOR 
TRADING PARTNERS.  HE NOTED THAT THE UAEG HAD NOT/NOT 
CONCLUDED A DOUBLE TAXATION TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES, 
BUT SUCH AN AGREEMENT REMAINS A PRIORITY FOR THE UAEG. 
 
¶2.  (U) AL-BUSTANI HIGHLIGHTED THE UAE'S DOUBLE TAXATION 
AGREEMENT WITH GERMANY, IN PARTICULAR, WHICH WAS SIGNED IN 
1996 AND APPLIED RETROACTIVELY FROM 1992.  HE SAID THAT THE 
TAX SITUATION OF UAE INVESTORS IN GERMANY HAS IMPROVED 
CONSIDERABLY -- PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT ON DIVIDENDS IS 
LIMITED TO 5 PERCENT AND REQUIRED TAX WITHHOLDINGS HAVE BEEN 
REDUCED TO ZERO.  A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE GERMAN EMBASSY 
NOTED THAT HIS COUNTRY HAS BENEFITED FROM THE INCREASE IN 
UAE INVESTMENT IN GERMANY SINCE THE CONCLUSION OF THE DOUBLE 
TAXATION AGREEMENT. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT: UAEG OFFICIALS HAVE ASKED TIME AND AGAIN 
FOR A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE MODALITIES OF CONCLUDING A 
DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH THE USG.  SUCH A TREATY IS A 
HIGH-PRIORITY FOR THE UAEG, AND WAS RAISED WITH ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS TONY WAYNE AT THE FIRST 
 
SIPDIS 
U.S.-UAE STRATEGIC DIALOGUE IN DECEMBER (SEE REF).  WE WOULD 
APPRECIATE GUIDANCE FROM TREASURY'S OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL 
TAX COUNSEL AS TO WHETHER SUCH AN AGREEMENT WOULD BE 
FEASIBLE, AND IF U.S. NEGOTIATORS WOULD WELCOME 
CONSULTATIONS WITH UAE OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON TO DISCUSS 
THE MATTER FURTHER.  END COMMENT.
