SUBJECT: CANADA SHARES U.S. VIEW ON ELECTION PROCESS IN 
CAMBODIA 
 
REF: STATE 139900 
 
Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). 
 
1.(C) Post delivered points contained reftel to Stuart 
Savage, Deputy Political Director in DFAIT's Southeast Asia 
Division, on May 29.  Savage indicated Canada shares our view 
that the government of Cambodia should be held to its 
commitment to conduct a credible national election. Savage 
said Canada's ambassador in Phnom Penh has been actively 
engaged in a series of meetings and programs to encourage 
fair elections. However, he said the GoC would not make a 
public statement concerning the elections before they take 
place. Canada will send interns working from its embassy in 
Phnom Penh, as well as officers from Canada's other embassies 
in the region, to serve as election observers. 
 
Â¶2. (C) Savage also mentioned that Canada, through its Human 
Security initiative, has been one of the main donors to an 
NGO project in Cambodia known as Impacs. He described Impacs 
as a media training program that teaches local media how to 
do unbiased reporting on elections. The Cambodian election is 
one of the pilot projects for Impacs.
