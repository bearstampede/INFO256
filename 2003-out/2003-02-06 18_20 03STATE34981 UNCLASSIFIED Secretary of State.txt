SUBJECT: REVISED GUIDANCE REGARDING LEAHY AMENDMENTS AND 
U.S. FOREIGN ASSISTANCE 
 
REF: (A) 99 STATE 103806, (B) 99 STATE 085337 
 
¶1.  THIS TASKER HAS BEEN CLEARED BY HR/RMA/CSEP FOR SEP 
POSTS.  THIS IS AN ACTION CABLE - SEE PARAGRAPHS 8-13 FOR 
DETAILS. 
 
        SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (A)  THIS CABLE REPRESENTS A REVISION OF PREVIOUS 
GUIDANCE (REFS A AND B) CONCERNING IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE 
AND DEFENSE STATUTORY PROVISIONS RELATED TO PROVIDING U.S. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        STATE   034981  061828Z 
FUNDS TO, AND TRAINING OF, UNITS OF FOREIGN SECURITY 
FORCES (THE "LEAHY AMENDMENTS"). 
 
(B)  THIS ACTION CABLE DOES NOT GRANT A "CLEAN SLATE" TO 
UNITS IN CASES WHERE IT HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONCLUDED THAT 
THERE IS CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT UNITS HAVE COMMITTED GROSS 
VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, OR A CLEAN SLATE FOR PREVIOUS 
ACTIONS BY UNITS FOR WHICH A DETERMINATION HAS NOT YET 
BEEN MADE.  ANY UNIT THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALREADY 
IDENTIFIED AS INELIGIBLE, SHALL REMAIN INELIGIBLE FOR 
FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING UNTIL 
FURTHER DECISION.  INFORMATION THAT COULD BE DEEMED 
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF A GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY 
A SECURITY FORCE UNIT, REGARDLESS OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME, 
WILL BE REPORTED BY POST AND WILL BE ADDRESSED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED IN THIS ACTION 
CABLE. 
 
(C)  THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THE "STATE LEAHY 
AMENDMENT," SECTION 556 OF THE FY 2002 FOREIGN OPERATIONS, 
EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT 
(FOAA), PROVIDES THAT NONE OF THE FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE BY 
THAT ACT MAY BE PROVIDED TO ANY UNIT OF A FOREIGN 
COUNTRY'S SECURITY FORCES IF THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS 
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT SUCH UNIT HAS COMMITTED GROSS HUMAN 
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, UNLESS CERTAIN CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN 
MET.  THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THE "DOD LEAHY 
AMENDMENT," SECTION 8080 OF THE FY 2003 DOD APPROPRIATIONS 
ACT, CONTAINS A SIMILAR PROVISION REGARDING DOD-FUNDED 
TRAINING PROGRAMS. 
 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        STATE   034981  061828Z 
(D)  PARAGRAPHS 8-13 PROVIDE REVISED GUIDANCE ON 
IMPLEMENTING THESE TWO PROVISIONS.  IN IMPLEMENTING THE 
LAW, THIS ACTION CABLE REQUIRES POSTS TO REPORT TO THE 
DEPARTMENT OF STATE ANY INFORMATION THAT COULD REASONABLY 
BE DEEMED TO BE CREDIBLE INFORMATION OF A GROSS VIOLATION 
OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY HOST NATION SECURITY FORCES RECEIVING 
OR SLATED TO RECEIVE FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR INVOLVED IN 
DOD-FUNDED TRAINING.  REPORTS OF INCIDENTS WILL NOT RESULT 
IN AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD- 
FUNDED TRAINING, BUT WILL TRIGGER A DEPARTMENTAL REVIEW 
THAT COULD RESULT IN A RECOMMENDATION TO TERMINATE FOAA- 
FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING. IF THE 
DEPARTMENT DETERMINES THAT THESE REPORTS CONSTITUTE 
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY A 
UNIT OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY'S SECURITY FORCES AND THAT 
CERTAIN CONDITIONS HAVE NOT BEEN MET, DEPARTMENT WILL 
GENERALLY ADVISE POST TO DELIVER A DEMARCHE TO THE HOST 
GOVERNMENT NOTIFYING IT OF THE INCIDENT(S), IDENTIFYING 
THE UNIT(S) INVOLVED, AND ADVISING THE HOST GOVERNMENT OF 
RESTRICTIONS ON DOD-FUNDED TRAINING OR FOAA-FUNDED 
ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE UNITS. 
 
BACKGROUND. 
 
¶3.  THE FIRST FORM OF THE STATE LEAHY AMENDMENT APPEARED 
IN THE FY 1997 FOAA.  AT THAT TIME IT APPLIED ONLY TO 
INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL (INC) FUNDING.  BEGINNING 
IN FY 1998 A SIMILAR PROVISION WAS ENACTED WHICH AFFECTED 
ALL FUNDS APPROPRIATED UNDER THE FOAA - NOT JUST 
COUNTERNARCOTICS FUNDS - AND SINCE THAT TIME VERSIONS OF 
THE PROVISION HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ANNUALLY. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 05        STATE   034981  061828Z 
 
¶4.  STATE LEAHY PROVISION:  THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE 
STATE LEAHY AMENDMENT, SECTION 556 OF THE FY 2002 FOAA, 
READS AS FOLLOWS: 
 
BEGIN TEXT:  NONE OF THE FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE BY THIS ACT 
MAY BE PROVIDED TO ANY UNIT OF THE SECURITY FORCES OF A 
FOREIGN COUNTRY IF THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS CREDIBLE 
EVIDENCE THAT SUCH UNIT HAS COMMITTED GROSS VIOLATIONS OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS, UNLESS THE SECRETARY DETERMINES AND REPORTS 
TO THE COMMITTEES ON APPROPRIATIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF 
SUCH COUNTRY IS TAKING EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO BRING THE 
RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES UNIT TO 
JUSTICE:  PROVIDED, THAT NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE 
CONSTRUED TO WITHHOLD FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE BY THIS ACT 
FROM ANY UNIT OF THE SECURITY FORCES OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY 
NOT CREDIBLY ALLEGED TO BE INVOLVED IN GROSS VIOLATIONS OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS; PROVIDED FURTHER, THAT IN THE EVENT THAT 
FUNDS ARE WITHHELD FROM ANY UNIT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE SHALL PROMPTLY INFORM THE FOREIGN 
GOVERNMENT OF THE BASIS FOR SUCH ACTION AND SHALL, TO THE 
MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE, ASSIST THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT 
IN TAKING EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO BRING THE RESPONSIBLE 
MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES TO JUSTICE.  END TEXT. 
 
¶5.  THE FIRST FORM OF THE DOD LEAHY PROVISION APPEARED IN 
SECTION 8130 OF THE FY 1999 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT 
WHICH PROHIBITED DOD-FUNDED TRAINING PROGRAMS INVOLVING A 
UNIT OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY'S SECURITY FORCES "IF THE 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAS RECEIVED CREDIBLE INFORMATION 
 
SIPDIS 
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE THAT A MEMBER OF SUCH UNIT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 06        STATE   034981  061828Z 
HAS COMMITTED A GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS..." UNLESS 
CERTAIN CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET.  BEGINNING IN THE FY 
2000 DOD APPROPRIATIONS ACT, HOWEVER, THE CLAUSE "A MEMBER 
OF SUCH UNIT" WAS DELETED.  SINCE FY 2000, THE DOD LEAHY 
PROVISION, LIKE THE STATE LEAHY PROVISION, HAS REFERRED TO 
CREDIBLE INFORMATION ABOUT SECURITY FORCE UNITS, RATHER 
THAN MEMBERS OF SUCH UNITS. 
 
¶6.  DOD LEAHY PROVISION:  THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE DOD 
LEAHY AMENDMENT, SECTION 8080 OF THE FY 2003 DOD 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, READS AS FOLLOWS: 
 
BEGIN TEXT:  (A) PROHIBITION - NONE OF THE FUNDS MADE 
AVAILABLE BY THIS ACT MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT ANY TRAINING 
PROGRAM INVOLVING A UNIT OF THE SECURITY FORCES OF A 
FOREIGN COUNTRY IF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAS RECEIVED 
CREDIBLE INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE THAT THE 
UNIT HAS COMMITTED A GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, 
UNLESS ALL NECESSARY CORRECTIVE STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN. 
 
(B) MONITORING - THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, IN CONSULTATION 
WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE, SHALL ENSURE THAT PRIOR TO A 
DECISION TO CONDUCT ANY TRAINING PROGRAM REFERRED TO IN 
SUBSECTION (A), FULL CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO ALL 
CREDIBLE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE 
RELATING TO HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BY FOREIGN SECURITY 
FORCES. 
 
(C) WAIVER - THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, AFTER CONSULTATION 
WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE, MAY WAIVE THE PROHIBITION IN 
SUBSECTION (A) IF HE DETERMINES THAT SUCH WAIVER IS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 07        STATE   034981  061828Z 
REQUIRED BY EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. 
 
(D) REPORT - NOT MORE THAN 15 DAYS AFTER THE EXERCISE OF 
ANY WAIVER UNDER SUBSECTION (C), THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE 
SHALL SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE CONGRESSIONAL DEFENSE 
COMMITTEES DESCRIBING THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES, THE 
PURPOSE AND DURATION OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM, THE UNITED 
STATES FORCES AND THE FOREIGN SECURITY FORCES INVOLVED IN 
THE TRAINING PROGRAM, AND THE INFORMATION RELATING TO 
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THAT NECESSITATES THE WAIVER.  END 
TEXT. 
 
¶7. THE STATE DEPARTMENT LEAHY PROVISION APPLIES TO ALL 
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE ANNUAL FOAA.  PROGRAMS 
FUNDED BY FOREIGN MILITARY FINANCING (FMF) GRANTS AND 
LOANS, INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 
(INCLE) FUNDS, INTERNATIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION AND 
TRAINING (IMET) FUNDS AND PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS (PKO) 
FUNDS AND CERTAIN NONPROLIFERATION, ANTI-TERRORISM, 
DEMINING AND RELATED PROGRAMS (NADR) FUNDS - E.G., ANTI- 
TERRORISM ASSISTANCE ARE OFTEN ORIENTED TO SECURITY 
FORCES.  OTHER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FUNDED, E.G., BY 
ECONOMIC SUPPORT FUNDS (ESF), FREEDOM SUPPORT ACT (FSA) 
FUNDS, ASSISTANCE FOR EASTERN EUROPE AND THE BALTIC STATES 
(AEEB AKA SEED) FUNDS, AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE (DA) 
FUNDS AND CERTAIN PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE NADR ACCOUNT 
(E.G., DEMINING ASSISTANCE) TYPICALLY DO NOT INVOLVE 
SECURITY FORCES, ALTHOUGH CERTAIN COUNTRIES' SECURITY 
FORCES MAY RECEIVE THESE TYPES OF ASSISTANCE.  ASSISTANCE 
PROGRAMS TAKE A WIDE ARRAY OF FORMS, INCLUDING: PROVISION 
OF COMMODITIES, EQUIPMENT, OR OTHER GOODS; TRAINING AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 08        STATE   034981  061828Z 
EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS; SUPPORT 
SERVICES, SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION, LOGISTICS, MAINTENANCE 
OF EQUIPMENT, AND CONFERENCE ATTENDANCE OR SUPPORT; GRANTS 
OR LOANS TO PROCURE GOODS AND SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF 
SECURITY FORCES; AND CASH TRANSFERS OF FUNDS.  THE STATE 
LEAHY AMENDMENT APPLIES TO THESE AND ALL OTHER FORMS OF 
ASSISTANCE USING FOAA-APPROPRIATED FUNDS IN ALL COUNTRIES 
TO WHICH THE U.S. PROVIDES SUCH ASSISTANCE. (NOTE:  THE 
EXPORT-IMPORT BANK (EX-IM) HAS ADVISED THE DEPARTMENT THAT 
IT TAKES THE POSITION THAT IN THE CASE OF PURCHASES BY 
SECURITY FORCES, THE LEAHY AMENDMENT APPLIES TO ITS LOAN 
AND GUARANTEE PROGRAMS.  ACCORDINGLY, HOST COUNTRY 
PROGRAMS THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM OR RECEIVE EX-IM SUPPORT 
SHOULD BE EVALUATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE FOAA-FUNDED 
PROGRAMS DESCRIBED IN THIS CABLE IF THEY INVOLVE PROVISION 
OF SUPPORT TO SECURITY FORCES.) 
 
¶8.  THE DOD LEAHY PROVISION APPLIES TO USE OF FUNDS MADE 
AVAILABLE UNDER THE ANNUAL DOD APPROPRIATIONS ACTS. 
EXAMPLES OF TRAINING PROGRAMS FUNDED WITH DOD FUNDS ARE 
LISTED IN PARAGRAPH 19. 
 
¶9. PRIOR-YEAR ASSISTANCE:  POSTS SHOULD FOLLOW PROCEDURES 
DETAILED HEREIN WITH REGARD TO USE OF ANY PREVIOUS YEARS' 
FOAA FUNDS OR ANY TRAINING USING PRIOR YEARS' DOD FUNDS 
THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO HOST NATION SECURITY FORCES. 
 
¶10.  THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE FOAA AND THE DEFENSE 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT VERSIONS OF THE LEAHY AMENDMENT ARE 
SIMILAR.  AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF 
STATE AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THIS CABLE:  (A) SETS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 09        STATE   034981  061828Z 
FORTH A PROCESS FOR IMPLEMENTING BOTH THE STATE AND DOD 
LEAHY AMENDMENTS; AND (B) ESTABLISHES A STRONGER 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN U.S. ASSISTANCE AND OBSERVANCE BY 
RECIPIENT NATION SECURITY FORCES OF INTERNATIONALLY 
ACCEPTED HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS. 
 
¶11.  AS POSTS REVIEW AND IMPLEMENT GUIDANCE DETAILED 
BELOW, THEY SHOULD KEEP IN MIND TWO OVERRIDING POLICY 
CONCERNS: 
 
(A)  U.S. ASSISTANCE PROVIDED UNDER THE FOAA - WHETHER IN 
THE FORM OF FUNDS, OTHER ASSISTANCE, OR TRAINING - SHOULD 
NOT BE PROVIDED TO UNITS OF FOREIGN SECURITY FORCES THAT 
HAVE ENGAGED IN GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AND DOD 
FUNDING SHOULD NOT BE PROVIDED FOR TRAINING INVOLVING SUCH 
UNITS; AND 
 
(B)  THE UNITED STATES SHOULD SEEK WAYS TO LEVERAGE ITS 
ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING TO ENCOURAGE HOST NATION 
GOVERNMENTS TO PREVENT SUCH VIOLATIONS AND TO HOLD PERSONS 
CREDIBLY BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH VIOLATIONS 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS, INCLUDING BY BRINGING SUCH 
PERSONS TO JUSTICE. 
 
POSTS SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT DOD DOES EXECUTE OR IS 
INVOLVED IN MANY OF THE FOAA-SPONSORED PROGRAMS TO WHICH 
THE STATE LEAHY PROVISION APPLIES (E.G., CERTAIN PROGRAMS 
FUNDED WITH FMF, IMET, INC, PKO, OR NADR FUNDS).  COUNTRY 
TEAM WILL NEED TO COORDINATE ACCORDINGLY TO ENSURE THAT 
THE CORRECT STATUTORY PROVISION (EITHER SECTION 556 OR 
SECTION 8080) IS APPLIED IN ANY RELEVANT INSTANCES IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 10        STATE   034981  061828Z 
WHICH THE DEPARTMENT HAS CREDIBLE INFORMATION OF GROSS 
VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY ANY UNIT OF A FOREIGN 
COUNTRY'S SECURITY FORCES.  THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS DO 
NOT/NOT APPLY EITHER TO FMS SALES, OR TO ISSUANCE OF 
LICENSES FOR COMMERCIAL MUNITIONS EXPORTS, WHEN THESE ARE 
NOT FUNDED BY U.S. SECURITY ASSISTANCE. 
 
ACTION. 
 
INCIDENT-RELATED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. 
 
¶12.  POSTS IN COUNTRIES THAT RECEIVE FOAA-FUNDED 
ASSISTANCE OR IN COUNTRIES WHERE UNITS OF FOREIGN SECURITY 
FORCES ARE INVOLVED IN DOD TRAINING ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE 
PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO IMPLEMENT THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS. 
DEPARTMENT PROVIDED GUIDANCE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE LEAHY 
AMENDMENTS IN 1998 AND 1999.  THE INSTRUCTIONS CONTAINED 
IN THIS CABLE REPLACE THIS PREVIOUS GUIDANCE.  POSTS 
SHOULD REVIEW THEIR PROCEDURES AND ENSURE THEY ARE 
CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT REQUIREMENTS, AS SET FORTH BELOW. 
 
¶13.  ANY TIME THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THAT A POST BECOMES 
AWARE OF ANY INFORMATION REGARDING INCIDENTS WHICH 
REASONABLY COULD BE DEEMED TO BE CREDIBLE INFORMATION OF A 
GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY ANY UNIT OF THE HOST 
NATION'S SECURITY FORCES RECEIVING OR PROPOSED TO RECEIVE 
FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR INVOLVED IN DOD-FUNDED TRAINING, 
AND REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF SUCH INFORMATION (E.G., 
STATE, DOD, DAOS/SAOS, OTHER POSTS, NGOS, MEDIA REPORTS, 
ETC.), POST SHOULD SO INFORM THE DEPARTMENT BY CABLE. 
POST SHOULD DRAW ON THE EXPERTISE OF DAOS/SAOS IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 11        STATE   034981  061828Z 
REPORTING SUCH INFORMATION.  POST SHOULD, TO THE EXTENT 
PRACTICABLE, IDENTIFY THE UNIT THAT HAS ALLEGEDLY 
COMMITTED THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND INCLUDE POST'S 
VIEW AS TO WHETHER THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS RISES TO 
THE LEVEL OF BEING A GROSS VIOLATION AND WHETHER IT 
BELIEVES THE INFORMATION IS CREDIBLE.  CABLES SHOULD BE 
SLUGGED ACTION FOR THE APPROPRIATE REGIONAL BUREAU, WITH 
PM, DRL, H, INR, L, INL, AND OTHER STATE AND DEFENSE 
DEPARTMENT BUREAUS AND OTHER U.S. AGENCIES, AS 
APPROPRIATE, SLUGGED FOR INFO.  REPORTS OF INCIDENTS WHICH 
COULD BE DEEMED GROSS VIOLATIONS WILL NOT RESULT IN 
AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD- 
FUNDED TRAINING, BUT WILL TRIGGER A REVIEW BY REGIONAL 
BUREAUS, PM, DRL AND OTHERS, AS APPROPRIATE, WHICH COULD 
RESULT IN A RECOMMENDATION TO TERMINATE FOAA-FUNDED 
ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING. 
 
¶14.  REGIONAL BUREAUS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING THE 
DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE TO REPORTS OF INCIDENTS UNDER 
PARAGRAPH 13.  IN CASES WHERE THE DEPARTMENT, AFTER 
CONSIDERING THE POSITIONS OF THE REGIONAL BUREAUS, DRL, PM 
AND OTHER RELEVANT BUREAUS, DETERMINES THERE IS A NEED FOR 
FURTHER REVIEW, THE REGIONAL BUREAU WILL SO ADVISE POST 
AND WILL MOVE TO RESOLVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ON A CASE- 
BY-CASE BASIS AND, AS APPROPRIATE, WITH DOD OR OTHER 
RELEVANT AGENCIES. 
 
¶15.  IF ANY CONCERNED BUREAU BELIEVES THERE IS IN FACT 
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT A SPECIFIC UNIT OR UNITS RECEIVING 
FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING HAS 
COMMITTED A GROSS VIOLATION OR GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 12        STATE   034981  061828Z 
RIGHTS, A MEMORANDUM SHALL BE PREPARED FOR DECISION BY THE 
SECRETARY.  IN ANY CASE WHERE THE SECRETARY DETERMINES 
 
SIPDIS 
THAT THERE IS CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF SUCH VIOLATION OR 
VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY ANY UNIT OR UNITS OF A 
FOREIGN COUNTRY'S SECURITY FORCES RECEIVING FOAA-FUNDED 
ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING, THE REGIONAL BUREAU 
WILL GENERALLY ADVISE POST TO DELIVER A DEMARCHE TO THE 
HOST GOVERNMENT NOTIFYING IT OF THE INCIDENT(S), 
IDENTIFYING THE UNIT(S) INVOLVED, AND (WHERE APPLICABLE) 
ADVISING THE HOST GOVERNMENT OF ANY RESTRICTIONS ON DOD- 
FUNDED TRAINING OR FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE THAT WILL APPLY 
WITH RESPECT TO SUCH UNIT(S).  IN SUCH CASES, DEPARTMENT 
MAY TAKE SUCH ACTIONS AS: REQUIRING ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS 
IN FUTURE AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED 
(INCLUDING, E.G., REVISING LOAS TO INCLUDE LANGUAGE 
REQUIRING RECIPIENT GOVERNMENTS NOT TO TRANSFER FMF-ORIGIN 
DEFENSE ITEMS TO OFFENDING UNITS); NOTIFYING CONGRESS OF 
THE COUNTRY'S FAILURE TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION; OR EVEN 
TERMINATING SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTRY.  PLEASE 
NOTE THAT NOTHING IN THESE PROCEDURES OR THIS ACTION CABLE 
SUPERCEDES THE PROCESS FOR CASE-BY-CASE APPROVAL AND 
VETTING AS PERFORMED BY REGIONAL BUREAUS, DRL, PM AND 
OTHER RELEVANT BUREAUS WITH INR'S SUPPORT WHEN DOD IS 
VETTING UNITS OR INDIVIDUALS FOR TRAINING. 
 
¶16.  DEPENDING ON CIRCUMSTANCES, DEPARTMENT MAY DIRECT 
POSTS TO DEMARCHE HOST GOVERNMENTS EVEN IN CASES WHERE 
EVIDENCE IS NOT DEEMED SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT A TERMINATION 
OF FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING BUT WHERE 
THE CAUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS COULD BE ADVANCED.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
POST MIGHT BE ADVISED TO REMIND THE COUNTRY IN QUESTION OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 13        STATE   034981  061828Z 
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RELEVANT LEAHY AMENDMENT AND THE 
FACT THAT LEAHY VIOLATIONS MAY RESULT IN THE TERMINATION 
OF FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING. 
 
APPORTIONMENT AND FUNDING REQUEST REQUIREMENTS. 
 
¶17.  BUREAUS SHALL INCLUDE IN ALL REQUESTS FOR PROGRAM 
FUNDS (E.G., VIA ALLOCATION MEMORANDA OR APPORTIONMENT 
REQUESTS) WITH RESPECT TO ESF, FMF, PKO, IMET, NADR AND 
ALL OTHER FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE TO BE PROVIDED TO 
SECURITY FORCES OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY, A STATEMENT 
INDICATING THAT THE APPROPRIATE REGIONAL BUREAU IS NOT 
AWARE OF CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS BY ANY SECURITY FORCE UNITS RECEIVING ASSISTANCE IN 
THE PARTICULAR COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES TO WHICH THE 
ASSISTANCE WOULD BE PROVIDED.  FOR COUNTRIES WHERE THE 
DEPARTMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT CREDIBLE EVIDENCE EXISTS 
THAT SUCH UNIT RECEIVING OR PROJECTED TO RECEIVE 
ASSISTANCE HAS COMMITTED GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, 
REGIONAL BUREAU SHALL INCLUDE IN ITS REQUEST WHAT 
EFFECTIVE MEASURES THAT COUNTRY IS TAKING TO BRING 
RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES UNIT TO JUSTICE 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LEAHY AMENDMENT (IN CASES INVOLVING 
DOD TRAINING, WHETHER AND WHAT CORRECTIVE STEPS HAVE BEEN 
TAKEN) AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION (E.G., ASSURANCES 
THE COUNTRY MAY HAVE PROVIDED THAT U.S. ASSISTANCE WILL 
NOT BE PROVIDED TO THAT UNIT). 
 
¶18.  THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY 
OF ESTABLISHING A "NAME CHECK" UNIT IN INR THAT WOULD RUN 
QUERIES AGAINST INR'S ELECTRONIC DATABASES TO IDENTIFY 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 14        STATE   034981  061828Z 
REPORTS ON SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES.  IF THE UNIT 
IS ESTABLISHED, INR WOULD PROVIDE RELEVANT MATERIALS TO 
THE BUREAUS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING A DETERMINATION OF 
ELIGIBILITY.  IF THE UNIT IS NOT ESTABLISHED, INR WILL 
HELP AS IT CAN BUT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHECK MORE THAN A 
FEW NAMES AT A TIME. 
 
DISCUSSION AND DEFINITIONS. 
 
¶19.  AS A MATTER OF LONGSTANDING POLICY, THE U.S. 
GOVERNMENT REQUIRES THAT CANDIDATES FOR ALL U.S.-SPONSORED 
TRAINING BE EVALUATED BY POSTS FOR A NUMBER OF 
DISQUALIFYING FACTORS.  TRAINING REQUESTS WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE VETTED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.  IF TRAINING IS 
SCHEDULED FOR UNITS, (E.G., MOBILE TRAINING TEAMS (MTTS) 
AND MOBILE EDUCATION TEAMS (METS)), POST IS NOT REQUIRED 
TO SCREEN EACH MEMBER OF THE UNIT(S) SCHEDULED FOR 
TRAINING.  INSTEAD, POST SHOULD REVIEW THE HUMAN RIGHTS 
RECORD OF THE UNIT AS A WHOLE.  IN CASES WHERE TRAINING IS 
SCHEDULED FOR AN INDIVIDUAL, IT CAN PROCEED IF THERE IS NO 
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS COMMITTED GROSS 
VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  (OF COURSE, POST RETAINS THE 
AUTHORITY TO DENY APPROVAL FOR TRAINING TO A CANDIDATE WHO 
DOES NOT PASS OTHER FACTORS OF THE SCREENING PROCESS, SUCH 
AS DRUG TRAFFICKING, CORRUPTION, HEALTH, CRIMINAL 
ACTIVITY, AND ACTIVITIES THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH U.S. 
FOREIGN POLICY GOALS.) 
 
¶20.  ACTIVITIES COVERED UNDER THE DOD LEAHY PROVISIONS 
INCLUDE ALL DOD-FUNDED TRAINING PROGRAMS SUCH AS JOINT 
COMBINED EXCHANGES FOR TRAINING (JCETS), COUNTERNARCOTICS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 15        STATE   034981  061828Z 
TRAINING, COMBATANT COMMANDERS INITIATIVE FUND, AND THE 
DOD REGIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM FELLOWSHIP TRAINING PROGRAM. 
 
¶21.  UNIT OF THE SECURITY FORCES:  THE PHRASE "UNIT OF THE 
SECURITY FORCES" IS NOT DEFINED IN THE LEGISLATION, BUT 
SHOULD BE APPLIED FOR THE PURPOSES OUTLINED IN THIS CABLE 
TO INCLUDE ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS OF MILITARY, POLICE, OR 
ANY OTHER SECURITY FORCES.  THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS DO 
NOT/NOT APPLY TO THE WHOLE OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT'S 
MILITARY, POLICE, OR OTHER SECURITY FORCES, BUT RATHER TO 
THE SPECIFIC COMPONENT UNITS RECEIVING TRAINING OR 
ASSISTANCE.  THE QUESTION OF WHAT LEVEL OR ENTITY 
CONSTITUTES A "UNIT" FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE LEAHY 
AMENDMENTS WILL BE DETERMINED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. 
THE SENATE REPORT ACCOMPANYING THE FY 2002 FOAA PROVIDES 
THAT THE TERM "UNIT" IS TO BE "CONSTRUED AS THE SMALLEST 
OPERATIONAL GROUP IN THE FIELD THAT HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN 
THE REPORTED VIOLATION."  AS A GENERAL RULE OF THUMB, POST 
SHOULD CONSIDER THE LOWEST ORGANIZATIONAL ELEMENT OF A 
SECURITY FORCE CAPABLE OF EXERCISING COMMAND AND 
DISCIPLINE OVER ITS MEMBERS. IN DETERMINING THE ENTITY TO 
BE VETTED WITH RESPECT TO MILITARY, POLICE, OR 
PARAMILITARY FORCES, POST SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE 
PURPOSE OF THE FORCE, ITS UNIQUE COMMAND STRUCTURE AS WELL 
AS THE SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS AT ISSUE.  INABILITY TO 
IDENTIFY A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL AS A PERPETRATOR WOULD 
NOT PRECLUDE A CONCLUSION THAT THE UNIT HAS COMMITTED A 
GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS IF FACTS OTHERWISE 
JUSTIFY SUCH A CONCLUSION.  POSTS SHOULD KEEP TRACK OF 
ALLEGATIONS OF GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS INVOLVING 
ANY UNIT OF THE SECURITY FORCES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 16        STATE   034981  061828Z 
THAT UNIT IS CURRENTLY RECEIVING TRAINING OR ASSISTANCE. 
 
¶22.  GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS:  ALTHOUGH THE TERM 
"GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS" IS NOT DEFINED IN THESE 
PROVISIONS, A SIMILAR TERM IS DEFINED IN SECTION 502B(D) 
OF THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT (FAA), AND POSTS SHOULD USE 
THAT DEFINITION AS A GUIDE: "THE TERM 'GROSS VIOLATIONS OF 
INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HUMAN RIGHTS' INCLUDES TORTURE 
OR CRUEL, INHUMAN, OR DEGRADING TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT, 
PROLONGED DETENTION WITHOUT CHARGES AND TRIAL, CAUSING THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF PERSONS BY THE ABDUCTION AND CLANDESTINE 
DETENTION OF THOSE PERSONS, AND OTHER FLAGRANT DENIAL OF 
THE RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY, OR THE SECURITY OF PERSON." 
 
¶23.  EXISTING REPORTING PROCEDURES FOR THE ANNUAL DRL 
HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT TO CONGRESS ARE UNCHANGED BY THIS 
ACTION CABLE:  THE DEPARTMENT'S ESTABLISHED HUMAN RIGHTS 
REPORTING PROCEDURES REQUIRE POSTS TO REPORT ANNUALLY ON 
INSTANCES OF GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS KNOWN OR 
RELIABLY PRESUMED TO HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED BY OFFICIALS OR 
AGENCIES OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.  DEPARTMENT GUIDANCE FOR 
THIS ANNUAL REPORT DOES NOT ASK POSTS TO REPORT ALL HUMAN 
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BY OFFICIALS OR AGENCIES OF FOREIGN 
GOVERNMENTS BUT RATHER A SAMPLING.  HOWEVER, FOR THE 
PURPOSES OF LEAHY, POSTS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY 
INFORMATION REGARDING INCIDENTS WHICH REASONABLY COULD BE 
DEEMED TO BE CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF GROSS VIOLATIONS BY ANY 
UNIT OF THE HOST NATION'S SECURITY FORCES RECEIVING FOAA- 
FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR INVOLVED IN DOD-FUNDED TRAINING, 
REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF SUCH INFORMATION (E.G., STATE, 
DOD, DAOS/SAOS, OTHER POSTS, NGOS, MEDIA REPORTS, ETC.). 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 17        STATE   034981  061828Z 
THE REQUIREMENT TO IMPLEMENT THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS MAKES IT 
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT POSTS BE ALERT AND REPORT 
PROMPTLY TO DEPARTMENT WHENEVER ANY RELEVANT INFORMATION 
BECOMES KNOWN TO POST. 
 
¶24.  CREDIBLE EVIDENCE:  WHILE THE DEPARTMENT RETAINS 
AUTHORITY FOR ALL FINAL DECISIONS REGARDING SPECIFIC CASES 
- INCLUDING THE "CREDIBILITY" OF EVIDENCE OF GROSS 
VIOLATIONS - IT MUST RELY, AT LEAST IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, 
ON POST'S JUDGMENT IN REVIEWING AND ASSESSING AVAILABLE 
INFORMATION FOR ITS RELIABILITY AND THE CREDIBILITY OF ITS 
SOURCE.  POST NEED NOT SUBMIT REPORTS THAT IT CONFIDENTLY 
BELIEVES TO BE UNFOUNDED.  IF IN DOUBT ABOUT THE 
CREDIBILITY OF INFORMATION, POST SHOULD SUBMIT TO THE 
DEPARTMENT AND SO NOTE. 
 
¶25.  WITH REGARD TO THE MEANING OF "EVIDENCE," REPORT 
LANGUAGE ACCOMPANYING THE FY 1999 FOAA PROVIDES:  "THE 
CONFEREES DO NOT INTEND THAT THE EVIDENCE MUST BE 
ADMISSIBLE IN A COURT OF LAW."  HOWEVER, NEITHER THE 
LEGISLATION NOR ACCOMPANYING REPORT LANGUAGE DEFINES 
"CREDIBLE."  POST SHOULD APPLY A RULE OF REASON IN 
INTERPRETING "CREDIBLE" IN VIEW OF THE OVERALL PURPOSE OF 
THE PROVISIONS, BEARING IN MIND THAT WHAT THE DEPARTMENT 
IS SEEKING IS INFORMATION DESERVING OF CONFIDENCE AS A 
BASIS FOR DECISION-MAKING.  INFORMATION THAT CAN BE 
CORROBORATED THROUGH INDEPENDENT SOURCES STRENGTHENS THE 
CREDIBILITY OF SUCH REPORTS.  NGOS CAN BE A VALUABLE 
SOURCE OF INFORMATION.  WEIGHT TO BE ACCORDED PARTICULAR 
REPORTS REQUIRES CAREFUL JUDGMENT AND MAY TURN ON 
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES - E.G., THE RECORD OF THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 18        STATE   034981  061828Z 
GOVERNMENTAL OR NON-GOVERNMENTAL GROUP FOR ACCURATE AND 
IMPARTIAL REPORTING AND THE DEGREE OF DETAIL PROVIDED. 
ALL EVIDENCE - BOTH SUPPORTING AND REFUTING - SHOULD BE 
TAKEN AS A WHOLE IN ASSESSING WHETHER EVIDENCE IS 
"CREDIBLE" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS. 
 
¶26.  PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT LEGAL AND POLICY ISSUES MAY 
ARISE IN CASES WHERE A PERPETRATOR OF A GROSS HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATION HAS CHANGED UNITS, OR EVIDENCE IS NOT TIED 
DIRECTLY TO SPECIFIC UNITS.  IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE 
LEAHY AMENDMENTS AND RELATED STATE DEPARTMENT POLICY, 
POSTS SHOULD IDENTIFY, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, ALL 
SECURITY FORCE UNITS WITH WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL FOR WHOM 
THERE IS CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF HAVING COMMITTED SUCH 
VIOLATIONS HAS BEEN A MEMBER, FROM THE DATE OF THE ALLEGED 
OFFENSE TO THE PRESENT.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF A SECURITY FORCE 
MEMBER ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED A VIOLATION WHILE ATTACHED TO 
UNIT X, BUT HAS SINCE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO UNIT Y, POST 
SHOULD ADVISE OF THAT PERSON'S RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH 
UNITS.  POST SHOULD PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE DESCRIPTION OF THE 
SECURITY FORCE ORGANIZATION, INCLUDING ITS STRUCTURE AND 
HIERARCHY, AND INSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS INVOLVED. 
 
¶27.  EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO BRING THE RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS 
TO JUSTICE:  FOR PURPOSES OF THE STATE LEAHY AMENDMENT, 
RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE HISTORY CONTAINS LANGUAGE REGARDING 
THE NEED FOR RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS TO "FACE IMPARTIAL 
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OR APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY 
DISCIPLINARY ACTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH LOCAL LAW." 
ORDINARILY, SOME CLEAR ACTION NEEDS TO OCCUR, E.G., 
INVESTIGATIONS, FORMAL ADMINISTRATIVE OR LEGAL PROCEEDING 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 19        STATE   034981  061828Z 
AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS IN QUESTION, OR 
OTHER ACTIONS DEMONSTRATING THE HOST NATION IS PROCEEDING 
TO BRING THE RESPONSIBLE PERSONS TO JUSTICE.  THE MERE 
TRANSFER FROM A UNIT OF AN INDIVIDUAL ACCUSED OF HAVING 
COMMITTED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES DOES NOT, IN AND OF ITSELF, 
CONSTITUTE THE NECESSARY EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO BRING THE 
RESPONSIBLE MEMBER(S) OF THE UNIT TO JUSTICE.  AN 
INVESTIGATION/PROSECUTION PROCESS NEED NOT HAVE BEEN 
CONCLUDED, NOR IS IT NECESSARY THAT THE PROCESS LED TO A 
CONVICTION.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE MERE OPENING OF A 
FORMAL INVESTIGATION DOES NOT, IN AND OF ITSELF, 
CONSTITUTE "EFFECTIVE MEASURES." 
 
THE REALISTIC CHANCE FOR SUCCESSFUL AND IMPARTIAL 
CONCLUSION OF THE INVESTIGATION, LEADING TO IMPARTIAL 
TRIAL AND APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT IF CONVICTED, SHOULD BE 
ASSESSED.  THE INSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF THE HOST NATION 
MILITARY AND CIVILIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM IS RELEVANT IN MAKING 
THE NECESSARY JUDGMENTS. 
 
NOTE THAT THE DOD LEAHY PROVISION IS WORDED DIFFERENTLY 
THAN THE STATE LEAHY PROVISION ON THIS POINT, THE FORMER 
REQUIRING THAT "ALL NECESSARY CORRECTIVE STEPS HAVE BEEN 
TAKEN" BEFORE DOD-FUNDED TRAINING INVOLVING A UNIT THAT 
HAS TRIGGERED LEAHY CAN TAKE PLACE.  THIS PHRASE IS NOT 
DEFINED IN THE LEGISLATION. 
 
¶28.  POST SHOULD DESIGNATE AN EMBASSY POINT OF CONTACT FOR 
THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS. AS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE ONE 
AMONG A SERIES OF OTHER CRITERIA THAT ARE TAKEN INTO 
CONSIDERATION BEFORE PROVIDING ASSISTANCE (E.G., COUNTER 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 20        STATE   034981  061828Z 
NARCOTICS, CORRUPTION), DEPARTMENT SUGGESTS THAT EMBASSY 
POC BE IN A POSITION TO COORDINATE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW 
WITH ALL RELEVANT MEMBERS OF THE COUNTRY TEAM. 
 
¶29.  AGENCIES OTHER THAN DOD (E.G., DEA, JUSTICE) 
RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING FOAA-FUNDED PROGRAMS WITH 
SECURITY FORCES SHOULD ENSURE SIMILAR COORDINATION AND 
COMMUNICATION WITH THE COUNTRY TEAM IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
THIS GUIDANCE. 
 
¶30.  DEPARTMENT WILL WORK WITH POSTS TO ENSURE THAT NGOS 
THAT IMPLEMENT FOAA-FUNDED PROGRAMS WITH SECURITY FORCES 
ARE INSTRUCTED OF THE NEED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH LEAHY 
LIMITATIONS.
