REF: DUBAI 1165 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C) Summary and comment:  Under the aegis of the 
government-run Red Crescent Authority (RCA), the UAE is 
gearing up to provide significant humanitarian 
assistance to the Iraqi people.  In addition to direct 
contributions from the UAEG, the Emirati public will be 
mobilized through a series of telethons, food drives at 
schools and businesses, and other activities that will 
emphasize popular participation.  The UAEG carried out 
similar humanitarian assistance programs for the 
Palestinians last year, directly channeling public 
frustration with events into positive activity.  While 
the UAE has a strong preference to work its 
humanitarian assistance directly (vice via multilateral 
organizations or programs), we will work closely with 
the RCA to track its activities and assist/deconflict 
as necessary and appropriate.  End summary and comment.

Red Crescent Authority Spearheads Relief Effort 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶3.  (C) UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and 
UAE Red Crescent Authority (RCA) Chairman Shaykh Hamdan 
Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan told the Ambassador on March 23 
that the Abu Dhabi-headquartered RCA, with branches 
throughout the UAE, would be responsible for the bulk 
of UAE humanitarian assistance to Iraq, and would begin 
distribution of food and supplies as soon as the 
security situation allows aid workers to enter safely. 
He agreed that the UAEG, at some point, would probably 
need to coordinate with the U.S. military to move 
humanitarian supplies and personnel into Iraq. 
 
¶4.  (C) Shaykh Hamdan noted that the RCA would 
immediately purchase about $3 million USD in medical 
supplies and other necessities on the local Iraqi 
market, to ensure prompt distribution to the needy. 
RCA already has provided more than $25,000 USD in 
supplies to hospitals and orphanages in Iraq. 
 
¶5.  (U) According to press reports, the RCA has 
established 115 posts throughout the UAE where 
donations in cash and supplies can be received.  RCA 
Manager of Relief and Projects Dr. Salih Al-Taie said 
the organization expects to provide tons of high- 
calorie food items, including milk powder and biscuits 
for children, and supplies such as tents and blankets 
to the people of Iraq.  Al-Taie said that the apparent 
shortage of drinking water in the city of Basra 
prompted RCA officials to purchase water filtering 
equipment and electricity generators, in addition to 
pharmaceutical products. 
 
¶6.  (U) An RCA delegation left Monday for Amman, Jordan 
to assess the humanitarian situation of refugees there, 
according to press reports.  RCA officials are 
organizing similar assessment visits to neighboring 
countries that expect to receive an influx of Iraqi 
civilians fleeing the war.

World Food Program Opens Its Doors In Dubai 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) The UAE Foreign Ministry yesterday signed an 
agreement with the United Nations World Food Program 
(WFP) formalizing WFP's regional office in Dubai. 
Shaykh Hamdan said that the WFP's regional office in 
Dubai would service the Iraqi people, and begin 
operations this week.  (Note:  This is apparently for 
reasons of political cover.  WFP has had a regional 
office in Dubai for some time, and its operations are 
not specifically related to the Iraq crisis, although 
it will in fact support them.  End note.)

Dubai Starts Its Own Iraq Relief Campaign 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (U) The Shaykh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum 
Charity and Humanitarian Foundation (whose patron is 
the UAE Defense Minister and Dubai Crown Prince) 
launched today a 12-hour telethon in support of the 
Iraqi people on Dubai Television.  The slogan of the 
telethon is "The Campaign For Our Brethren In Iraq." 
The Foundation is an umbrella organization of 16 
charities in the UAE, and has launched a month-long 
campaign to raise funds and supplies for the Iraqi 
people.  On 23 March, Shaykh Mohammed offered the 
Foundation's assistance distributing food aid to Iraqis 
(which he feels would be more acceptable to Iraqis than 
direct USG assistance)(reftel). 
 
¶9.  (U) According to press reporting, Dubai Attorney 
General and Vice-Chairman of the MBR Foundation Ibrahim 
Bu Melha confirmed that the Foundation had opened two 
bank accounts to receive donations, as well as 
collection centers where donors can drop relief goods. 
The Foundation is ready to send teams to Iraq to 
supervise the distribution of goods. 
 
¶10.  (U) Bu Melha said that coordination with 
international organizations in Iraq began before the 
war.  The Foundation stored 500 tons of dates and other 
foodstuff in mosques around Baghdad a month ago. 
Foundation officials had hoped that Coalition forces 
would not destroy mosques. Prior to the onset of 
hostilities, the Foundation made arrangements with 
relief agencies in Iraq to begin distributing some of 
these items -- more than 300 tons of dates have already 
been distributed, he told the press. 
 
¶11. (U) In the northern emirate of Ajman, a 3-day 
fundraiser for Iraqi children started today as part of 
the "Funtasia 2003" festival.  However, a children's 
festival in the emirate of Ras Al Khaimah was 
cancelled today to express solidarity for the 
suffering of the Iraqi people.
