SUBJECT:  LIFT AND SUSTAIN OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF POLISH 
STABILIZATION FORCES IN IRAQ 
 
REF: State 210590 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (S) The Ambassador asked UAE Chief of Staff LT. 
General Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed (MBZ) whether the 
UAE would be able to provide continued "lift" in 
support of Iraqi stabilization efforts. MBZ said 
that they could not commit, at this time, to 
additional support beyond the current operation. 
The Ambassador pointed out that, in six months, 
forces would rotate out without equipment.  He took 
the information on board but did not commit the 
UAEG to any further support, and told the 
Ambassador they would discuss the matter again in 
the fall. 
 
¶3. (S) Comment:  The air and sealift support that 
the UAEG provided to the Bulgarians took far more 
resources from both the UAEG and the mission than 
anyone originally anticipated.  UAEG airlift and 
sealift assets did not match our requirements for 
the task.  As a result, the UAEG needed to charter 
at least 3 aircraft and one ship so far to meet its 
commitments.  We understand that it will need to 
charter additional aircraft to lift the main body. 
 
¶4. (S) Comment Continued:  In addition, the 
coordination effort needed between the USG, the 
UAEG, and the third country was a major task for 
our USLO office here.  In fact, USLO sent one 
officer to Bulgaria with the UAEG in order to 
ensure everything went smoothly.  It was a very 
successful operation, but the financial and human 
resources expended by all sides were considerable. 
End Comment. 
Wahba
