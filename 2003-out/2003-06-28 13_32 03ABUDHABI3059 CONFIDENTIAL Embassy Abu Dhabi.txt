SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON SIERRA LEONE SPECIAL COURT/OIC: 
UAE 
 
REF: STATE 177065 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by A/DCM Thomas E. Williams for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) Econoff accompanied the Dutch Ambassador and a 
counterpart from the British Embassy in delivering 
reftel demarche points June 28 to MFA Organizations 
and Conferences Director Mohamed Jassem Samhan Al- 
Nuaimi.  The demarche was also presented on behalf of 
the Canadian Embassy. Al-Nuaimi asked why the UN was 
not funding the Court and repeatedly questioned why 
the appeal was directed at individual states and did 
not come through the OIC. While remaining 
noncommittal, Al-Nuaimi said he would pass the 
information on to his superiors. We will report the 
UAEG response when we receive it.
