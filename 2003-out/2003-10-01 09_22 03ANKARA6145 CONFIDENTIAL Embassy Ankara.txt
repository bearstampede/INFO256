Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch.  Reasons 1.5 B and D. 
 
 
¶1. (C) On October 1, MFA Economics Department Head Akif Ayhan 
told PolMilOff that Turkish missions in Washington and 
Baghdad would be demarching State and CPA respectively to 
request a USG/CPA delegation with reps from Washington and 
Baghdad come to Ankara in the near future to discuss with the 
GOT prospects for opening a second border gate between Turkey 
and Iraq.  Ayhan said that MFA Undersecretary Ziyal expected 
US and CPA reps to come to Ankara to discuss the modalities 
and principles of opening a second gate, as well as issues of 
logistics and political concerns about how this might be done 
on the Iraqi side of the border.  Ayhan asked that we pass 
this request onto both CPA and State. 
 
 
¶2. (C) Assuming such a delegation does come to Ankara, Post 
strongly recommends including in it a representative from the 
Iraqi Ministry of Interior who can speak authoritatively 
about Iraqi plans for rules and regulations, as well as 
staffing, for existing border crossings, and the process that 
the Ministry would require for opening a new crossing, 
whether on a temporary or permanent basis. 
 
 
¶3. (U)  Baghdad minimize considered.
