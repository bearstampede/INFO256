¶1. (SBU) Summary: The UAEG's amnesty program failed to 
significantly reduce the number of illegal laborers in 
the UAE. Only 60,000 illegals have left the country, 
far less than the hoped for 250,000-300,000. Though 
the amnesty may continue on indefinitely, it failed 
because illegal workers do not believe the UAEG will 
crack down on them nor do they fear the repercussions 
of getting caught. There is little actual difference 
for illegals between taking advantage of the amnesty 
and being captured by the police: detention, 
deportation, and a ban on returning to the UAE to 
work.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The UAE Labor Ministry implemented the 
current amnesty to establish better control over the 
UAE labor market by removing illegal workers (see ref 
A). When the amnesty began, UAE officials hoped that 
250,000-300,000 illegal expatriates would leave as 
they did during the first amnesty in 1996. However, as 
of the middle of June, only 85,000 workers had applied 
for the amnesty and approximately 60,000 had departed. 
In conversations with the various foreign labor 
attaches in Abu Dhabi, Econoff learned that 25,000 
Indians, 12,500 Pakistanis, 15,000 Bangladeshis, 3,600 
Sri Lankans, and 4,000 Filipinos took advantage of the 
amnesty. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The labor attaches maintain there are three 
types of illegal laborers in the UAE: those who enter 
the country illegally, those who overstay a valid 
tourist visa, and those who overstay a valid work 
visa. The Pakistani attache told Econoff that the 
first category consists primarily of Pakistanis who 
obtain a visa to enter Iran, ferry over to Oman, and 
then cross the border into the UAE. The Indian and 
Filipino diplomats contend that their nationals are 
more likely to fall into the latter two categories and 
overstay valid visas. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The UAEG originally designated the amnesty 
to run from January 1, 2003, to April 30, 2003, but it 
has been extended twice -- once officially and once 
unofficially.  After the initial period ended, the 
UAEG officially extended the amnesty to May 31, but 
has continued to process applications without any 
formal proclamation. Some of the labor attaches 
believe the amnesty will continue indefinitely (and 
unofficially) until the UAEG can save face and 
announce a significant tally such as 100,000.  Other 
observers contend that the amnesty will end in June 
because the entire UAEG will be on vacation in July 
and August. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: The amnesty failed because workers 
do not believe the UAEG will crack down on illegal 
labor after the amnesty ends, nor are there any 
repercussions for getting caught. Workers prefer 
taking their chances and continuing to earn money. The 
1996 amnesty was successful primarily because illegals 
believed the UAEG would strictly enforce the law once 
the program ended. Illegal laborers now view official 
threats as empty because the UAEG failed to follow 
through with any significant action after the original 
amnesty ended. Furthermore, there are no repercussions 
for getting caught as an illegal laborer. Workers do 
not pay fines -- most would not have the money to pay 
penalties -- but are simply deported to their home 
country.  In Abu Dhabi Emirate, the government even 
pays for a ticket home. Illegals also are aware that 
jail space in the UAE is limited -- if prisons fill 
up, the UAEG will stop conducting sweeps. After two 
amnesties, but a continuing rise in the population of 
illegal laborers, the UAEG must accept a difficult 
truth: true reform of the labor market will require 
taking a harder line on illegal overstays, including 
the UAE nationals who profit immensely by brokering 
expatriate visas for non-existent jobs (see ref B). 
End comment.
