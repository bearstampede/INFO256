SUBJECT:  GSL SUPPORTS KEEPING GI TALKS IN TRIPS COUNCIL 
 
REF: STATE 254589 
 
Per reftel, Econoff delivered points to Ms. Manel De Silva, 
Acting Director General of the Sri Lankan Commerce Department 
on September 5, 2003.  Reftel points were also delivered to the 
GSL delegation prior to its departure for Cancun.  Post has 
previously discussed this issue with the GSL, during an 
Embassy-sponsored video conference on GI issues last week.  The 
GSL continues to agree that the appropriate forum for these 
discussions is in the TRIPS Council, not the agricultural 
talks.  As requested, we have urged the GSL to firmly oppose 
any EU efforts to raise this issue in the Agricultural 
Committee.
