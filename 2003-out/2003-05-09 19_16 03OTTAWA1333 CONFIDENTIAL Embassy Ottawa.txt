TAGS: PARM MNUC IR CA NPT
SUBJECT: NPT: IRAN'S BOGUS CLAIMS OF CANADIAN NUCLEAR 
COOPERATION 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) informed us that in its May 5 briefing at the 
NPT PrepCom, Iran indicated that it is considering use of 
Canadian Cando reactors in the Iranian nuclear program. 
DFAIT reminded us that there is no public or private Canadian 
nuclear cooperation with Iran, and that the GoC will continue 
to ensure no future cooperation.  Iran's motivation in citing 
Cando, DFAIT continued, was to try to butress their claims 
that the Iranian nuclear program is purely civilian.  DFAIT 
noted that "Nucleonics Week" has already picked up this story 
from Iran's presentation.  The GoC is trying to beat the 
story back with Nucleonics Week, but it will likely get some 
press play.
