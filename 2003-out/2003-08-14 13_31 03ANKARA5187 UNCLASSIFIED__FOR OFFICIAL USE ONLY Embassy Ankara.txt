 ¶1. (SBU) DEPUTY ECONCOUNS SPOKE AUGUST 14 WITH UZGUR ULUDUZ, 
WHO HAS TAKEN OVER THE IRAQI ASSETS ISSUE IN 
THE MFA'S BILATERAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS DEPARTMENT, TO FOLLOW 
UP ON THE ACTION REQUEST IN REF A. ULUDUZ 
EXPLAINED THAT FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF THE EMBASSY'S DIPLOMATIC 
NOTE (REF B) MFA HAD DISTRIBUTED IT TO ALL 
RELEVANT AGENCIES WITHIN THE GOT AND REQUESTED THESE AGENCIES 
SEEK ANY RECORDS OF ASSETS IN THE NAME OF 
THE INDIVIDUALS ON THE ATTACHED LIST. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) ULUDUZ SAID THAT TO DATE NO OFFICIAL IRAQI ASSETS 
NOR ANY ASSETS FOR THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN FOUND. 
THE GOT HAS NOT RESPONDED OFFICIALLY TO THE U.S. REQUEST, 
HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE GOT HAS NOT YET DECIDED EXACTLY 
HOW THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ISSUE WILL BE SHARED BY THE 
RELEVANT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. ULUDUZ EXPLAINED 
THAT THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE'S ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AGENCY 
(MASAK) WAS RESISTING TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
IRAQI ASSET SEIZURES, YET THE FOREIGN MINISTRY ALSO IS 
HESITATING TO TAKE THE LEAD ON AN ISSUE REQUIRING 
AUTHORITY TO SEIZE FINANCIAL ASSETS. ACCORDING TO ULUDUZ, A 
WEEK OR TWO AGO THE FINANCE MINISTRY WROTE THE 
FOREIGN MINISTRY TO SAY THEY WILL BE PROPOSING A NEW 
FRAMEWORK TO HANDLE THESE ISSUES. THE MFA AWAITS THE 
MINFIN PROPOSAL. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) ALTHOUGH THE GOT HAS FOUND NO IRAQI ASSETS, ULUDUZ 
POINTED OUT THAT ANY SUCH ASSETS THAT THEY DO 
FIND ARE LIKELY TO BE SET OFF AGAINST GOT CLAIMS ON IRAQ 
UNDER GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT AGREEMENTS 
PRIOR TO THE GOT TURNING THESE ASSETS OVER TO THE DFI. 
EMBOFF REITERATED REF A POINTS REGARDING THIS KIND 
OF OFFSETTING OF IRAQI ASSETS. 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) AS NOTED IN REF D, THE MFA TOLD EMBOFFS IN MARCH 
THAT THE USD 80,000 IN IRAQI ASSETS DECLARED IN JUNE, 
1991 WAS "GONE," AND SPECULATED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO 
PAY TURKISH CLAIMS AGAINST IRAQ.
