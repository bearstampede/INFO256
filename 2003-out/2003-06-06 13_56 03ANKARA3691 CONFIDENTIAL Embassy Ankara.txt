SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON STROVILIA DELIVERED 
 
 
REF: SECSTATE 152362 
 
 
(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5 (b,d). 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) We presented reftel demarche to Ethem Barkan Oz, 
first secretary in Cyprus Directorate General, who undertook 
to convey USG concerns to Cyprus DG Ertugrul Apakan. 
 
 
¶2. (C) Implying that he did not understand why the USG was 
making the demarche, Oz denied vehemently that Turkish 
Cypriots are breaking any pre-existing agreement with the UN 
or Cypriot government.  Oz explained that the Turkish 
Cypriots had only occupied the single -- and abandoned, he 
claimed -- home in Strovilia to help facilitate the flow of 
people between the two sides.  Further, Oz argued that unless 
the Turkish Cypriots remain in the house, they will not be 
able to keep the gate open.  By lodging complaints with 
UNFICYP about Strovilia, Oz asserted, the Greek Cypriots are 
spoiling the current positive atmosphere on the island.
