¶1. (U) Jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was visited March 12 
for the first time since November 27 by his brother Mehmet 
and three attorneys.  Jandarma officials had previously 
blocked visits to Ocalan's Imrali Island prison, supposedly 
due to stormy weather (Reftels B-D). 
 
 
¶2. (C) Comment: This visit will do little, by itself, to 
relieve mounting tensions among Turkish Kurds, who fear they 
will suffer a GOT crackdown if/when the fighting starts in 
Iraq.  By isolating Ocalan for such an extended period with 
such a flimsy excuse, the GOT has sent a clear message to the 
Kurds, as it did March 13 when it took legal actions against 
two pro-Kurdish parties (Reftel A).
