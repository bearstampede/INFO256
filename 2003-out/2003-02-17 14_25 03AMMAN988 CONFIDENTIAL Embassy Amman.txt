Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
Â¶1.  (C)  PolCouns February 16 discussed ref points on North 
Korea and the NPT with Ali al-Ayed, Personal Assistant to 
Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher.  Al-Ayed responded that, 
while Jordan has not been directly involved in the North 
Korea dispute, it hopes that the current confrontation can be 
resolved peacefully.  He noted that, as important as North 
Korea is, Jordan feels more threatened by nuclear weapons 
programs in its neighborhood and hopes the USG will hold 
Israel to the same standard it is applying to North Korea.
