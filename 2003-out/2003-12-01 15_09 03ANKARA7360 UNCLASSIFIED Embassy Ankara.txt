BRIEFING 
 
 
Turkish Engineer Released by the Taliban:  Turkish Engineer 
Hasan Onal, kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan about a 
month ago, was freed over the weekend.  Engineer Onal said 
that the Taliban had kidnapped him mistakenly, believing him 
to be a US citizen.  Sunday's "Cumhuriyet" reports that 
engineer Onal, who arrived at the Turkish Embassy in Kabul, 
is in good health. 
 
 
Investigation of Istanbul Bombings:  "Hurriyet" reports that 
the fourth suicide bomber, who carried out the attack in 
front of the HSBC bank in Levent, has been identified as 
Ilyas Kuncak, a 47-year-old spice shop owner who lived in 
Istanbul.  Kuncak reportedly left his home two months ago, 
saying that he wanted to visit Muslim holy places. 
"Hurriyet" reports that three of the four suicide bombers 
had met in Pakistan for Islamic religious training. 
Sunday's "Milliyet" reports that police have made 
considerable progress in the investigation, and have 
concluded that the attacks were carried out by a ten-member 
Al-Qaeda cell based in Turkey.  Today's "Sabah" reports that 
one of the planners of the attacks, Yusuf Polat, revealed 
that the group's main target had been the  US Embassy and 
Consulate.  The team responsible for the planned attacks 
against US targets, Polat said, had apparently been captured 
by the police.  Polat claimed that most of the bombers had 
been trained in a terrorist camp in Afghanistan, which had 
been established to train Turks for participation in Al- 
Qaeda operations. 
 
 
Syria Hands Over 22 Suspects to Turkey:  In what some papers 
and TV channels characterize as a "cross-border operation" 
into Syria," Turkish officials detained 22 suspects in the 
Istanbul bombing cases who had escaped to Syria.  "Hurriyet" 
reports that the suspects were detained by Syrian police 
following an official request by the Turkish side. Papers 
note that that this is the first time Syria has cooperated 
with Turkey in the fight against terrorism. 
 
 
Turkey Isolated From Europe in Wake of Terror Attacks: 
"Cumhuriyet" reports that Turkey has been isolated by 
European countries in the wake of last month's terrorist 
attacks in Istanbul.  The EU commission has postponed its 
activities for the rest of the year that were scheduled to 
take take place in Turkey.  In reaching its decision, the 
Commission cited concerns of a "security risk" in Turkey. 
Many leading European countries warned their nationals 
against travelling to Turkey.  Sunday's "Hurriyet" reports 
that Britain has restricted visas for Turkish tourists. 
 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: Campaign Against Terrorism 
 
 
"Where Do We Stand in the War Against Terrorism?" 
Yilmaz Oztuna observed in the conservative-mass appeal 
Turkiye (12/1): "The US felt obliged to launch a global war 
against terrorism following the events of September 11.  Yet 
the goal has become controversial, as the effort also 
included a plan to control the world's oil reserves. 
Nevertheless, there is no point for the US to give up the 
fight against terrorism.  There will always be allies for 
achieving this goal.  On this issue, the US and Europe have 
different views.  The US is very determined to eliminate the 
terrorism problem, while Europe is still seems to believe 
that all is well as long as the Europeans are not hit. 
Moreover, the European attitude toward the recent terrorist 
bombings is a clear statement of fear.  That attitude will 
do nothing but encourage international terror.  It remains 
to be seen when Europe will be in the same line with the US 
in the fight against terrorism."
