attend the June 21-23 World Economic Forum meeting in Jordan. 
We received a call on June 16 from the acting DDG for the 
Americas at the MFA, who requested a bilat for FM Gul with 
Secretary Powell, schedule permitting, at the meeting in 
 
SIPDIS 
Jordan. 
 
 
¶3. (C) If the Secretary's schedule permits, we recommend a 
bilat with FM Gul. This is a good opportunity for the two to 
discuss Iraq and Middle East policy, other essential policy 
areas, and U.S.-Turkey cooperation on these issues.
