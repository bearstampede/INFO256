SUBJECT: JORDAN SUPPORTS SEATING IGC AT OCTOBER OIC SUMMIT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 276470 
 
Classified By: Amb. Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  PolCouns and PolOff covered ref points on seating 
the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) at the upcoming meeting of 
the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in Kuala 
Lumpur with Ali al-Ayed, Director of Foreign Minister 
Muasher's Private Office on September 29.  PolCouns asked 
that Jordan support the full participation of IGC members at 
the OIC meeting in Iraq's seat, noting that the IGC has been 
similarly seated in recent Arab League, UNGA, OPEC, and 
IMF/IBRD meetings. 
 
¶2.  (C)   Ayed responded that the Iraqi "Embassy" in Amman 
had also expressed to the MFA concerns that Malaysia might 
oppose seating the IGC in Iraq's seat at the OIC meeting, and 
had asked that Jordan support the IGC.  Ayed said Jordan 
wants to deal pragmatically with the IGC, and supports IGC 
participation in the October OIC meeting in the Iraqi chair 
in much the same arrangement used for the recent Cairo Arab 
League meeting:  full participation without formal 
recognition.  He said that Jordan's OIC delegation will work 
with other like-minded states to secure IGC participation at 
the OIC on this basis.
