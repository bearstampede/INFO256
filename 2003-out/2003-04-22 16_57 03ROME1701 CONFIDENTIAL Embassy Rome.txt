SUBJECT: TFIZ01: ITALY NEEDS GUIDANCE ON FIELD HOSPITAL 
DEPLOYMENT 
 
REF: A. ROME 1679 
     ¶B. ROME 1660 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: A/DCM TOM COUNTRYMAN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 

THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  PLEASE SEE PARA 4. 
 
¶1.  (C)  THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT, THE PUBLIC, AND THE GOI ARE 
EAGER TO SUPPORT A HUMANITARIAN MISSION TO IRAQ.  FOR THE 
GOI, THE COMMITMENT OF HUMANITARIAN AID -- IMPORTANT IN AND 
OF ITSELF -- ALSO PROVIDES THE JUSTIFICATION FOR PUTTING 
BOOTS ON THE GROUND IN SUPPORT OF PHASE IV (REF A).  WE 
THEREFORE HAVE EVERY INTEREST IN HELPING THE ITALIANS SUCCEED 
WITH BOTH EFFORTS.  THE FOCUS OF THEIR EFFORTS TODAY IS ON 
DEPLOYING TO IRAQ THE FIELD HOSPITAL THAT THE USG URGENTLY 
REQUESTED OF ITALY. 
 
¶2. (C) UNFORTUNATELY, THE GOI'S IRAQ TASK FORCE HAS GOTTEN 
AHEAD OF ITSELF IN MOVING AHEAD WITH PLANNING FOR DEPLOYING A 
FIELD HOSPITAL TO A SPECIFIC SITE IN BAGHDAD (REF B) WITHOUT 
PROPER COORDINATION IN TAMPA.  A SIX MEMBER SITE SURVEILLANCE 
TEAM LED BY THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE MFA'S DEVELOPMENT 
ASSISTANCE OFFICE CROSSED INTO IRAQ FROM JORDAN ON APRIL 20. 
THE TEAM INFORMED THE EMBASSY IN AMMAN OF ITS TRAVEL PLANS 
JUST BEFORE ENTERING, BUT FAILED TO WORK THROUGH EITHER 
CENTCOM OR THIS EMBASSY IN ARRANGING THE VISIT.  ACCORDING TO 
THE MFA, THE TEAM HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH (UNIDENTIFIED) USG 
OFFICIALS IN BAGHDAD, WHO HAVE INDICATED THAT THE SITE IN 
BAGHDAD IS APPROPRIATE IF HIGHER CENTCOM OFFICIALS CONCUR. 
WE ARE PRESSING THE MFA TO PROVIDE MORE DETAIL ON THE TEAM'S 
ACTIVITIES AND CONTACTS. 
 
¶3.  (C) MOREOVER, THE TASK FORCE IS STILL HAVING PROBLEMS 
WITH THE CONCEPT OF A "SELF-DEPLOYABLE/SELF-PROTECTING" FIELD 
HOSPITAL.  DEFMIN MARTINO TOLD THE AMBASSADOR TODAY (SEPTEL) 
    THAT WHILE A 30 MAN-CARABINIERI UNIT WOULD PROVIDE INTERNAL 
SECURITY FOR THE HOSPITAL, THE GOI WILL ASK THE U.S. MILITARY 
TO SECURE THE SURROUNDING PERIMETER.  WE ARE FOLLOWING UP 
WITH THE TASK FORCE TO REITERATE THAT 1) CENTCOM HAS THE CALL 
ON THE HOSPITAL'S LOCATION; 2) COORDINATION WITH CENTCOM 
SHOULD BE WORKED THROUGH THE ITALIAN LNO, GENERAL SANTINI, IN 
TAMPA; AND 3) ITALY SHOULD PROVIDE ALL NEEDED SECURITY, BOTH 
INTERNAL AND PERIMETER. 
 
¶4.  (C) ACTION REQUEST:  THE GOI, WE WERE TOLD ON APRIL 22 
(SEPTEL), MUST STILL SEEK AUTHORIZATION FROM PARLIAMENT FOR 
DEPLOYING A BRIGADE-SIZE FORCE TO ASSIST WITH PHASE IV 
STABILIZATION EFFORTS.  THIS WILL BE AN EASIER SELL FOR THE 
GOI IF IT WILL HAVE ALREADY DEPLOYED BY THEN ITS FIELD 
HOSPITAL IN A SITE ACCEPTABLE TO CENTCOM.  EMBASSY REALIZES 
HOW RAPIDLY THE HUMANITARIAN PICTURE ON THE GROUND IS 
CHANGING, BUT WE STILL NEED, EITHER FROM SECSTATE OR DIRECTLY 
FROM CENTCOM, CONFIRMATION THAT THE GOI-PROPOSED LOCATION 
(REF B) IS ACCEPTABLE.  IF IT IS NOT, WE REQUEST THAT CENTCOM 
EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF SITING THE HOSPITAL NEAR BASRA, 
WHERE (WE UNDERSTAND) IT IS ENVISIONED THE BULK OF THE 
ITALIAN MILITARY FORCES WILL EVENTUALLY DEPLOY.  END ACTION 
REQUEST.
