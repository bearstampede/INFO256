(U)  Per Reftel, Mission has conveyed the urgent points 
regarding the additional action on the UNGA Middle East 
resolution on the International Court of Justice to the 
Sri Lankan and Maldivian governments.  In light of the 
urgency of this matter and the fact that high-level Sri 
Lankan MFA officials are out of the country, we also 
suggest that the U.S. points be communicated directly to 
the Sri Lankan UN delegation by the U.S. Mission in New 
York.
