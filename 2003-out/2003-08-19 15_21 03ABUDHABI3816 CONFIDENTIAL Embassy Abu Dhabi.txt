¶1. (U) Classified by Charge d'Affaires, a.i., 
Richard Albright, for Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) Summary: In the wake of the Iraqi 
Governing Council's (GC) first visit to the UAE, 
UAEG officials were cautiously optimistic that 
the entire Arab world will eventually throw its 
support behind the Iraqi people.  For the time 
being, the UAEG says it is prepared to lobby 
diplomatically and publicly for the Iraqis, 
especially targeting the Arab League where there 
is still enmity toward the UAE dating back to 
Sheikh Zayed's initiative calling on Saddam 
Hussein to step down.  This cable is based on 
readouts of the visit.  End summary. 
 
¶3. (C) Information Minister Sheikh Abdullah Bin 
Zayed Al-Nahyan told Charge shortly after the 
delegation had departed for Oman, the evening of 
August 18, that the UAEG was pleased with the 
talks, but continues to be disappointed with the 
lack of support for the GC by some Arab 
countries and the Arab League.  Sh. Abdullah 
pointedly noted that the GC has an official 
invitation to visit Iran, which is more than can 
be said of the Arab League and most Arab 
countries. 
 
¶4. (C) Prior to their arrival (see reftel), the 
UAEG had promised a strong statement backing the 
GC and continued UAE economic and humanitarian 
support for Iraq.  Following the visit, on 
August 19, the Emirates News Agency released a 
statement by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh 
Khalifa Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan saying that 
President Zayed "had taught us that solidarity, 
cooperation and helping out a brother in weal 
and woe were the principles that should guide 
the relationship between brothers."  The 
statement continued, "It is imperative on us to 
support the Iraqi people and the Governing 
Council's efforts out of desire to see Iraq 
surmount the present state of affairs and build 
a better future for its sons."  Sh. Khalifa 
stressed that the UAE, under the leadership of 
Sheikh Zayed, would spare no efforts to stand by 
the Iraqi people until they get over the 
difficult times they are experiencing now.  "The 
UAE will back up the Governing Council in its 
endeavor to bring security and stability to the 
Iraqi people, form a national government, and 
draft a constitution for the country." 
 
¶5. (C) In a further readout of the visit, HbZ's 
Office Director, Sultan Al-Romeithi, told 
Polchief August 19 that the GC asked the UAEG 
for its support to win the recognition of Arab 
League states.  "They need us to lobby for 
them," and "We are going to go to the maximum on 
this." 
 
¶6. (C) Al-Romeithi acknowledged that one of his 
country's main obstacles will be Arab League 
Secretary General Amr Moussa.  "We haven't been 
 
SIPDIS 
good friends with the Secretary General," he 
said.  "But we enjoy strong connections with 
countries in the Arab League that could work 
alongside us on this.  Amr Moussa is not the one 
who makes the calls."  The fact that several 
countries in the region  o far, the UAE, Oman, 
Bahrain  ad welcomed the GC this week should 
make a difference, Al-Romeithi said.  "We were 
trying to push others and it appears that they 
followed in our tracks," he added. 
 
¶7. (C) The IGC delegation consisted of Council 
President, Dr. Ibrahim Al-Jafari, and five other 
Council members.  Flown in from Baghdad by the 
Emiratis on August 17, the delegation was 
greeted first by Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh 
Sultan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, then had a private 
meeting with de facto Foreign Minister Sheikh 
Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan (HbZ).  Later in the 
day, they met with the Iraqi community in Abu 
Dhabi, a meeting described as positive by Al- 
Romeithi.  The following day, the GC met with 
the Crown Prince, had lunch with HbZ, then met 
with Sheikh Abdullah, and with the Minister of 
Higher Education Sheikh Nahyan Bin Mubarak Al- 
Nahyan.  The delegation was given a visit of 
Zayed University.  The meetings covered a wide 
range of issues for existing and potential 
cooperation between the two countries, including 
education and infrastructure building, Al- 
Romeithi told Polchief.  The GC was to have met 
with meetings in Dubai, but that portion of the 
trip was canceled to fit in travel to Oman, 
which was scheduled at the last minute. 
 
¶8. (C) From the GC's perspective, the visit to the 
UAE  he first country on the itinerary  as "the 
cream" of the trip, Al-Romeithi said.  Al-Jafari 
was reportedly very appreciative of the UAE's 
stance.  In a statement, Al-Jafari said the GC was 
keen to begin its Arab tour with a visit to the UAE 
"which was at the top of countries that came to the 
rescue of the Iraqi people."  He and Sheikh Khalifa 
both talked about solidarity and building bridges. 
Al-Jafari also acknowledged the negative stands by 
some Arab countries (referring to Syria, Egypt, and 
Saudi Arabia), but expressed hope that Arabs will 
support and sympathize with what the GC is trying 
to accomplish. 
 
¶9. (C) Polchief asked Al-Romeithi if the GC 
delegation had any messages to pass on to the USG. 
The GC did mention that they had had a good 
exchange of views in meetings with Americans, and 
that business was conducted in transparent fashion.
