Â¶1.  (C)  Ambassador and PolCouns June 26 delivered to Foreign 
Minister Marwan Muasher ref points asking that Jordan 
encourage Indian participation in an Iraqi stabilization 
force.  Muasher noted that Jordan and India had already 
agreed to adopt jointly a small number of hospitals in Iraq. 
He said Jordan recognizes the need for an international 
stabilization force in Iraq and would support Indian 
participation in that force.  He noted, however, that Jordan 
would not contribute forces to an Iraqi stabilization force, 
preferring to contribute to the rebuilding of Iraq in other 
ways.
