E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: 
SUBJECT: NEPAL: POLICE DETAIN 19 UNDOCUMENTED TIBETANS 
 
REF: KATHMANDU 1074 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  EMBASSY DISCUSSIONS WITH NEPAL'S PRIME 
MINISTER AND UNHCR SUGGEST THAT 19 UNDOCUMENTED TIBETANS 
DETAINED IN WESTERN NEPAL ON JUNE 24 MAY BE TURNED OVER 
UNHCR.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) ON JUNE 24, NEPALI POLICE OFFICERS ARRESTED 19 
UNDOCUMENTED TIBETANS IN THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF ACCHAM. 
THE TIBETANS REPORTEDLY HAD CROSSED INTO NEPAL AT THE 
REMOTE NORTHWESTERN DISTRICT OF HUMLA.  AN OFFICE OF TIBET 
OFFICIAL CONFIRMED THAT TIBETAN REFUGEES COMMONLY USE THIS 
FAR-WESTERN ROUTE, ALTHOUGH THE EMBASSY KNOWS OF NO 
PREVIOUS DETENTIONS OF REFUGEES IN THIS DISTANT, LARGELY 
INACCESSIBLE REGION.  ACCORDING TO UNHCR OFFICIALS IN 
KATHMANDU, THE TIBETANS WERE TRANSPORTED ON JUNE 27 TO 
KAILALI DISTRICT SOUTH OF ACCHAM, WHERE THEY WILL BE HELD 
IN DETENTION PENDING FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE 
DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ON JUNE 27 UNHCR INFORMED THE HOME MINISTRY BY 
TELEPHONE OF ITS INTEREST IN THE DETAINED TIBETANS.  UNHCR 
SENT A LETTER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION ON THE SAME 
DAY REQUESTING THAT THE TIBETANS BE ESCORTED TO KATHMANDU 
AND HANDED OVER DIRECTLY TO UNHCR FOR PROCESSING AT THE 
RECEPTION CENTER.  AS OF COB JUNE 27, THE DEPARTMENT OF 
IMMIGRATION HAD NOT YET RESPONDED TO THE LETTER.  NEITHER 
THE OFFICE OF TIBET NOR THE UNHCR HAS RECEIVED ANY 
INDICATION THAT THE TIBETANS WILL BE DEPORTED.  ON THE 
CONTRARY, A UNHCR OFFICIAL EXPRESSED OPTIMISM THAT THE 
TIBETANS WOULD BE TURNED OVER TO THE ORGANIZATION UPON 
THEIR ARRIVAL IN KATHMANDU. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  ON JUNE 27 THE AMBASSADOR RAISED THE DETENTIONS 
WITH PRIME MINISTER SURYA BAHADUR THAPA, URGING THAT THE 
19 BE HANDED OVER TO UNHCR IN KEEPING WITH NEPAL'S PAST 
POLICY OF TOLERANCE TOWARD ASYLUM SEEKERS.  THAPA ASSURED 
THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE REFUGEES WOULD BE DULY HANDED OVER 
TO UNHCR, AND ADDED THAT HE IS PREPARING A REPLY TO A JUNE 
19 LETTER FROM NINE U.S. CONGRESSMEN PROTESTING THE MAY 31 
DEPORTATIONS OF 18 TIBETANS (REFTEL). 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT.  GIVEN THE GON'S REPEATED ASSURANCES 
(INCLUDING A JUNE 16 LETTER FROM PRIME MINISTER THAPA TO 
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN) THAT THE MAY 31 DEPORTATION OF 
18 TIBETAN REFUGEES WAS AN ANOMALY THAT WOULD NOT RECUR, 
POST IS OPTIMISTIC THAT THESE 19 TIBETANS WILL BE 
PROCESSED QUIETLY AND WITHOUT UNNECESSARY DELAY.  HOWEVER, 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION CLOSELY.  END 
COMMENT.
