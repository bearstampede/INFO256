E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EAIR ECON PREF CA
SUBJECT: NEW U.S.- CANADA AVIATION PRECLEARANCE AGREEMENT 
 
REF: OTTAWA 965 
 
¶1.  The United States and Canada exchanged diplomatic notes 
May 2, bringing into effect the Aviation Preclearance 
Agreement that had been signed in 2001.  Ambassador Cellucci 
exchanged notes with Foreign Minister Graham in a ceremony in 
Canada's Parliament building.  Transportation Minister 
Collenette also participated. 
 
¶2. The Ministers and the Ambassador made brief remarks. 
Graham praised the Ambassador for his work to overcome 
obstacles and bring the agreement into force.  He also noted 
that the agreement took account of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and that it would allow for expansion of preclearance 
services to other airports.  Collenette described the 
advantages of in-transit preclearance, although he did not 
actually use that term.   Ambassador Cellucci said that the 
agreement helped to improve security for U.S. preclearance 
personnel, and stressed that preclearance is a great 
convenience that promotes tourism, business, and family ties 
among Americans and Canadians. 
 
¶3. There was a substantial press contingent at the event. 
The questions for the Ambassador and the Ministers, however, 
focused on upcoming Canadian government decisions about the 
decriminalization of marijuana and about participation in a 
missile defense program. 
 
¶4. Comment: In recent conversations, Canadian officials have 
emphasized that the major advantage to Canada from the new 
agreement is the prospect of in-transit preclearance in 
several Canadian airports.  However,  these officials have 
said they are not aware of any plans by an airport to request 
in-transit preclearance in the near term.
