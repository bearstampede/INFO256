CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT; 
REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  IN A FRANKLY ANTI-CLIMATIC CONCLUSION TO THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL'S ROLE IN DEBATING THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, 
THE COUNCIL HELD AN OPEN SESSION MARCH 19 ATTENDED BY 
MINISTERS FROM FRANCE, GERMANY, RUSSIA, SYRIA, AND GUINEA. 
(GUINEAN FM FALL WAS IN NEW YORK TO PRESIDE OVER THE COUNCIL 
SESSION ON SMALL ARMS AND MERCENARIES IN AFRICA WEDNESDAY, 
AND REMAINED FOR THE MEETING.)  WHILE DIVISIVENESS AMONG 
COUNCIL MEMBERS WAS MUTED, MARKING MOVEMENT TO MINIMIZE 
DIFFERENCES, NATIONAL STATEMENTS NONETHELESS REFLECTED 
CLASSICAL POSTURES ON IRAQ, LIKELY TO RESURFACE IN UPCOMING 
COUNCIL DIALOGUES ABOUT OIL-FOR-FOOD (OFF) AND OTHER NEXT 
STEPS.  ALTHOUGH THE PRESS SPOTLIGHT ON THE COUNCIL HAD 
LARGELY DIMMED EVEN BEFORE THE MEETING, MOST COUNCIL MEMBERS 
-- EXCLUSIVE OF THE U.S., UK, AND SPAIN -- DEFENSIVELY 
POSTURED ABOUT THE RELEVANCE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF BOTH THE 
COUNCIL AND, MORE BROADLY, THE UNITED NATIONS. 
 
¶2. (C) BLIX ACKNOWLEDGED THE LIMITED RELEVANCE OF THE DRAFT 
PROGRAM OF WORK BEFORE THE COUNCIL, WHILE SYG ANNAN MET HEAD 
ON THE FACT THAT HUMANITARIAN CHALLENGES WOULD ARISE FROM 
MILITARY CONFLICT.  BOTH AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE AND UK PERMREP 
GREENSTOCK SPOKE TO STEPS ALREADY TAKEN IN PREPARING FOR 
HUMANITARIAN NEEDS, WHILE SPANISH PERMREP ARIAS SET OUT 
SUCCINCTLY AND CLEARLY SADDAM HUSSEIN'S PATH TOWARDS 
CONFRONTATION.  FRENCH FM DE VILLEPIN SET OUT TWO ALTERNATE 
APPROACHES IN THE WORLD TODAY: THE USE OF FORCE TO SOLVE 
COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND, BY WAY OF CONTRAST, A LONG-TERM 
APPROACH WHICH RECOGNIZED THAT ALL ASPECTS, INCLUDING 
RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL, NEEDED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. 
THAT SAID, FRANCE WOULD BE A "FULL PARTICIPANT IN STANCHING 
THE WOUNDS OF WAR."  RUSSIAN FM IVANOV REJECTED ANY LINKAGE 
BETWEEN 9/11 AND IRAQ, AS WELL AS ANY LEGITIMACY OTHER THAN 
THAT CONFERRED BY THE COUNCIL FOR THE USE OF FORCE.  GERMAN 
FM FISCHER DEFENDED THE COUNCIL AND REITERATED GERMAN 
OPPOSITION TO ANY MILITARY SOLUTION, STRESSING THAT PROGRESS 
WAS BEING MADE.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SYRIAN FM SHARA'S 
RHETORICAL STATEMENT, OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS' STATEMENTS WERE 
LARGELY UNREMARKABLE, GROUPED AROUND SEVERAL MAIN THEMES: 
THE COUNCIL'S ROLE AND LEGITIMACY, PREFERENCE FOR A PEACEFUL 
SOLUTION BUT RECOGNITION THAT SUCH HAD FAILED, AND IMPERATIVE 
TO SAFEGUARD THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION TO THE GREATEST 
EXTENT POSSIBLE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
U.S., UK, SPAIN, BULGARIA:  RESOLUTE, BUT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN 
AVOIDED 
 
 
U.S.: FOCUS FORWARD ON HUMANITARIAN ASPECTS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE THANKED UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA FOR 
THEIR WORK PROGRAMS AND THEIR EFFORTS, BUT POINTED OUT THAT 
IMMEDIATE APPROVAL OF THEIR WORK PROGRAMS WAS INCOMPATIBLE 
WITH THE CURRENT LEVEL OF IRAQI COOPERATION AND PREMATURE 
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE GROUND.  HE ASKED THAT THE 
WORK PROGRAM BE SET ASIDE FOR THE TIME BEING, BUT SAID THE 
UNITED STATES DID NOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT MAY 
PROVE USEFUL TO RETURN TO THESE DOCUMENTS AT SOME TIME IN THE 
FUTURE. 
 
¶4. (U) AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE THEN TURNED THE COUNCIL'S 
ATTENTION TO THE FUTURE, AND THE HUMANITARIAN NEEDS OF THE 
IRAQI PEOPLE IN THE TIME AHEAD.   HE TOUCHED ON U.S. PLANNING 
EFFORTS, ANNOUNCED THE DISPATCH OF A DISASTER ASSISTANCE 
RESPONSE TEAM (DART), THE PRE-POSITIONING OF USD 16.5 MILLION 
IN SUPPLIES, AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF USD 60 MILLION TO UN 
AGENCIES. HE SAID THE U.S. WOULD INCREASE DONATIONS, AND 
URGED OTHER DONORS TO DO LIKEWISE.  AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE 
ANNOUNCED THAT THE U.S. WOULD SOON PRESENT A DRAFT 
HUMANITARIAN RESOLUTION TO ENSURE THE CONTINUITY OF THE 
OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAM.  HE ENDED BY EXPRESSING U.S. READINESS 
TO WORK WITH THE COUNCIL ON ISSUES RELATED TO THE SITUATION 
IN IRAQ IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS TO COME. 
 
¶5. (U) FULL TEXT OF AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE'S REMARKS SENT REF A. 
 
 
UK: LOOKING AHEAD 
------------------ 
 
¶6. (C) UK PR GREENSTOCK SAID THE UK HAD TRIED HARD TO AVERT 
CONFLICT AND SEE TO IRAQ'S PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT, BUT THAT 
IRAQ FOR TWELVE YEARS HAD FAILED TO RESPOND TO THE COUNCIL'S 
PLEAS OR DEMANDS.  HE OBSERVED THAT, IF IRAQ HAD RESPECTED 
THE UN, THE COUNTRY WOULD NOT BE FACING HOSTILITIES. 
 
¶7. (C) GREENSTOCK ARGUED THAT THE UN HAD TO PLAY A ROLE IN 
IRAQ'S FUTURE, AND QUOTED UK FS STRAW'S MARCH 17 COMMENTS 
REGARDING SAFEGUARDING IRAQ'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, THE 
LIFTING OF SANCTIONS, AND THE RIGHT OF IRAQ'S PEOPLE TO 
IRAQ'S OIL WEALTH.  GREENSTOCK EXPRESSED THE UK'S SUPPORT FOR 
RECONFIGURING OFF AND SAID HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE 
PRESENTATION OF IDEAS BY THE SYG.  HE ALSO ADVOCATED FUTURE 
ROLES FOR UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA IN ASSESSING IRAQI WMD PLANS 
AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ONGOING MONITORING SYSTEM. 
 
¶8. (C) GREENSTOCK ANNOUNCED THAT THE HMG MINISTER FOR 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT WAS IN NEW YORK ON MARCH 19 AND 
THAT THE UK WOULD BE DONATING USD 110 MILLION FOR IMMEDIATE 
HUMANITARIAN RELIEF AND WOULD BE LIKELY TO DONATE MORE. 
 
¶9. (C) TURNING TO THE UNMOVIC WORK PROGRAM AND KEY REMAINING 
DISARMAMENT TASKS, GREENSTOCK SAID THAT SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD 
REQUIRE A COOPERATING IRAQI GOVERNMENT.  BOTH WORK PROGRAMS 
SHOULD BE KEPT UNDER REVIEW, READY TO BE USED WITH AN IRAQI 
GOVERNMENT PREPARED TO COOPERATE ACTIVELY, IMMEDIATELY, AND 
UNCONDITIONALLY. 
 
 
SPAIN: SADDAM'S PATH OF CONFRONTATION 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶10. (C) SPANISH PERMREP ARIAS, WHILE COMMENDING THE WORK OF 
THE INSPECTORS, SQUARELY BLAMED SADDAM HUSSEIN FOR THE 
SUSPENSION OF INSPECTIONS.  HE STATED: 
 
-- SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD OPENLY CHOSEN THE PATH OF 
CONFRONTATION, AND HE ALONE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
CONFRONTING THE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES LAID OUT IN UNSC 
RESOLUTIONS. 
 
-- THE UNANIMOUS ADOPTION OF USNCR 1441 CHANGED THE PARADIGM 
OF INSPECTIONS UNDER UNSCR 1284 AND THE PROGRAM OF WORK. 
WITHOUT FULL COOPERATION FROM IRAQ, THE WORK PROGRAM WOULD 
NOT BE POSSIBLE. 
 
-- TOGETHER WITH THE U.S. AND UK, SPAIN HAD TRIED TO ACHIEVE 
A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE IRAQI CRISIS THROUGH INCREASED 
PRESSURE FOR IRAQ TO MAKE A "STRATEGIC DECISION" TO COOPERATE 
FULLY WITH INSPECTORS.  IRAQ HAD FAILED TO TAKE ITS FINAL 
OPPORTUNITY. 
 
-- SPAIN BELIEVED, HOWEVER, THAT A NEW RESOLUTION WAS NOT 
NECESSARY BECAUSE THE LEGAL BASIS FOR FORCE WAS GIVEN IN 
UNSCRS 660, 678, 687 AND 1441. 
 
-- IRAQ HAD NOT MET ALL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER UNSCR 687, 
INCLUDING CONTINUING TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO TERRORISTS. 
 
-- AT THIS LATE STAGE, IRAQ HAD FAILED TO SUBMIT A FULL 
ACCOUNT OF ITS WMD DEMANDED BY PARAGRAPH NINE OF UNSCR 687, 
AND LATER EMPHASIZED IN UNSCR 1441. 
 
-- SPAIN REMAINED CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN DIMENSION 
OF CONFLICT.  THE COUNCIL SHOULD CONSIDER A DRAFT RESOLUTION 
TO ALLEVIATE HUMANITARIAN SUFFERING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
 
 
BULGARIA: IRAQI REFUSAL TO COOPERATE 
EXHAUSTED POLITICAL PROCESS 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶11. (C) BULGARIAN PERMREP TAFROV STATED THAT THE SUSPENSION 
OF INSPECTIONS SHOULD NOT CALL INTO QUESTION THE USEFULNESS 
OF THE INSPECTIONS PROCESS WRIT LARGE IN THE PREVENTION OF 
WMD PROLIFERATION.  HE CONTINUED: 
 
-- ACTIVE AND FULL COOPERATION WAS REQUIRED FOR INSPECTIONS 
TO BE EFFECTIVE.  IRAQ HAD NOT COOPERATED ACTIVELY. 
 
-- BULGARIA REGRETTED THAT DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS DID NOT YIELD 
RESULTS.  IRAQ'S REFUSAL TO COOPERATE WITH INSPECTIONS HAD 
CAUSED THE POLITICAL PROCESS TO BECOME EXHAUSTED, AND THE 
FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 1441 NOT TO BE REALIZED. 
 
-- IRAQ HAD FAILED TO SEIZE THE LAST CHANCE TO DISARM IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH UNSC RESOLUTIONS, PARTICULARLY UNSCR 1441. 
 
-- WHILE THE COUNCIL WAS ABLE TO REACH CONSENSUS ON THE ISSUE 
OF IRAQI DISARMAMENT, IT WAS NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE SAME 
UNITY ON THE METHOD OF DISARMAMENT. 
 
-- BULGARIA SUPPORTED THE SYG'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW ALL UN 
STAFF FROM IRAQ TO ENSURE THEIR SAFETY. 
 
-- NOW THE COUNCIL SHOULD FOCUS ON THE URGENCY OF THE 
HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN IRAQ, AND SUPPORT THE CIVILIAN 
POPULATION OF IRAQ. 
 
-- BULGARIA WANTED TO PRESERVE THE ROLE OF THE UN AND THE 
COUNCIL WHICH PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN PRESERVING 
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE WORLD.  ACCORDINGLY, 
THE COUNCIL SHOULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE REBUILDING 
OF IRAQ AFTER CONFLICT. 
 
 
SYG ANNAN: SAD DAY FOR THE WORLD; 
OCCUPYING POWER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IRAQI PEOPLE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶12. (U) SYG ANNAN (FULL REMARKS IN REF B) SAID THE SESSION 
MARKED "A SAD DAY FOR THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY."  HE CONTINUED THAT "MILLIONS OF 
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SHARED THIS SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT 
AND ARE DEEPLY ALARMED BY THE PROSPECT OF IMMINENT WAR."  THE 
SYG COMMENDED THE WORK OF UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA, AND SAID HIS 
PRIMARY CONCERN NOW WAS DEALING WITH THE HUMANITARIAN 
SITUATION OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE.  THE SYG WARNED THAT, UNDER 
INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROTECTING 
CIVILIANS IN CONFLICT FALLS ON THE BELLIGERENTS. SIMILARLY, 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE POPULATION FALLS ON THE 
OCCUPYING POWER.  ANNAN WARNED THAT HE HAD REQUESTED USD 
123.5 MILLION FROM DONORS, BUT TO DATE HAD RECEIVED ONLY USD 
45 MILLION IN PLEDGES AND OF THAT USD 34 MILLION HAS ACTUALLY 
BEEN RECEIVED.  ANNAN CONCLUDED THAT THE TASK OF REBUILDING 
AND REHABILITATING IRAQ COULD YET PROVE TO BE TASK AROUND 
WHICH THE UNITY OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL COULD BE REBUILT. 
 
 
BLIX: WORK PROGRAM NOW HAS LIMITED PRACTICAL RELEVANCE 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶13. (U) UNMOVIC EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN BLIX (FULL COMMENTS REF C) 
EXPRESSED RELIEF THAT ALL UNMOVIC PERSONNEL HAD BEEN SAFELY 
EVACUATED TO CYPRUS.  HE TOUCHED ON THE PROGRAM OF WORK MADE 
AVAILABLE TO COUNCIL MEMBERS ON MONDAY, MARCH 17, AND 
"EXPRESSED SADNESS THAT THREE AND A HALF MONTHS OF WORK 
CARRIED OUT IN IRAQ HAVE NOT BROUGHT THE ASSURANCES NEEDED 
ABOUT THE ABSENCE OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION."  BLIX 
RECOGNIZED THAT THE WORK PROGRAM HAD BEEN DRAFTED FOR 
IMPLEMENTATION BY A LARGE STAFF OF UNMOVIC INSPECTORS, AND 
THAT IT WOULD SEEM TO HAVE LIMITED PRACTICAL RELEVANCE IN THE 
CURRENT SITUATION.  HE ADVISED THAT UNMOVIC ROLES AND 
FUNCTIONS CONTINUE UNLESS AMENDED BY A FURTHER DECISION BY 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL, AND THAT THE UNMOVIC STAFF DID 
REPRESENT A UNIQUE BODY OF EXPERIENCE THAT SHOULD BE KEPT IN 
MIND BY MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL. 
 
 
IAEA: READY FOR QUESTIONS 
-------------------------- 
 
¶14. (C) IAEA NEW YORK REPRESENTATIVE ZLAUVINEN ANNOUNCED THAT 
THE IAEA WORK PROGRAM WAS READY FOR CONSIDERATION BY COUNCIL 
MEMBERS (FAXED TO NP AND IO/UNP AND REF D).  HE SAID THAT 
IAEA DIRECTOR GENERAL EL-BARADEI WAS READY TO FIELD ANY 
INQUIRIES FROM COUNCIL MEMBERS. 
 
 
FRANCE, RUSSIA, CHINA, GERMANY, SYRIA 
 
 
FRANCE:  "DEMOCRACIES SHOULD SET THE EXAMPLE; 
PERSUASION AS IMPORTANT AS RAW POWER 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶15. (C) FRENCH FM DE VILLEPIN FOCUSED HIS REMARKS ON THE NEED 
FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO FOCUS ON COOPERATIVE 
EFFORTS ACROSS A RANGE OF ISSUES.  VILLEPIN OFFERED A MORE 
MEASURED PRESENTATION, ALBEIT ONE STILL COUCHED IN SWEEPING 
TERMS, THAN HIS PAST PRESENTATIONS IN THE COUNCIL.  AS 
BEFORE, APPLAUSE ERUPTED IN THE CHAMBER AT THE CONCLUSION OF 
HIS INTERVENTION.  FULL TEXT OF HIS REMARKS REPORTED REF E. 
 
-- THE MAP LAID OUT IN UNSCR 1441 WAS STILL AVAILABLE 
ALTHOUGH BEING "BLOCKED" TODAY; 
 
-- TWO VISIONS WERE REFLECTED IN THE WORLD TODAY:  THE USE OF 
FORCE TO SOLVE COMPLEX PROBLEMS VERSUS A LONG-TERM APPROACH 
WHICH RECOGNIZED THAT ALL ASPECTS OF PROBLEMS NEEDED TO BE 
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, SUCH AS RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL FACTORS. 
 
-- DEMOCRACIES NEED TO SET THE EXAMPLE. 
 
-- THE MIDDLE EAST WAS A REGION OF ANCIENT CONFLICTS AND 
INSTABILITY. 
 
-- IRAQ COULD HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT AND EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR 
OTHER NON-PROLIFERATION AREAS; A TOOL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN 
FURTHER EXPLORED.  WHY NOT A UN "DISARMAMENT CORPS" UNDER AN 
INTERNATIONAL UMBRELLA? 
 
-- THE WORLD NOW RAN THE RISK OF FAILURE, INCREASING TENSION 
AND HELPING FEED TERRORISM. 
 
-- NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO SOON STAUNCH THE WOUNDS OF WAR 
AND FOCUS ON HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE; WE MUST PREVAIL OVER 
DIFFERENCES.  FRANCE INTENDED TO BE A FULL PARTICIPANT IN 
SUCH EFFORTS. 
 
-- THE OIL-FOR-FOOD (OFF) PROGRAM NEEDED TO CONTINUE WITH 
NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS - FRANCE LOOKED FORWARD TO RECEIVING 
THE SYG,S PROPOSALS IN THIS REGARD. 
 
-- NO ONE STATE COULD LAY CLAIM TO BUILDING THE PEACE; THE UN 
WAS THE ONLY AUTHORITY IN SUCH CASES. 
 
-- TWO PRINCIPLES NEEDED TO BE FOLLOWED:  TERRITORIAL 
INTEGRITY OF IRAQ AND ITS SOVEREIGNTY. 
 
-- THE WORLD FACED OTHER THREATS, SUCH AS TERRORISM AND 
ORGANIZED CRIMINAL NETWORKS; STATES MUST SHOW UNITY IN SUCH 
AREAS AND ON ALL FRONTS. 
 
-- THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM NEEDED TO BE INTENSIFIED, 
WITH NEW IMPETUS ON DEALING WITH WMD; FRANCE SUGGESTED A 
MEETING OF HEADS OF STATE/GOVERNMENT ON THE SIDELINES OF THE 
NEXT GENERAL ASSEMBLY. 
 
-- THERE WERE NEW INITIATIVES ON THE MIDDLE EAST THAT 
DESERVED ATTENTION. 
 
-- IN DEALING WITH THESE ASYMMETRICAL THREATS, THE ABILITY OF 
COUNTRIES TO "PERSUADE WOULD BE AS IMPORTANT AS THE NUMBER OF 
(MILITARY) DIVISIONS." 
 
-- THREE FACTORS WERE INDISPUTABLE TO A COUNTRY'S INFLUENCE: 
RESPECT FOR LAW, DEFENSE OF FREEDOM AND JUSTICE AND A SHOW OF 
DIALOGUE AND TOLERANCE. 
 
 
RUSSIA:  WE REMEMBERED 9/11 AND WERE THERE 
FOR YOU -- BUT NO LINKAGE WITH IRAQ 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶16. (C) RUSSIAN FM IVANOV RESTATED THE CENTRAL IMPORTANCE OF 
THE COUNCIL IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND NOTED THAT PRESIDENT 
PUTIN HAD BEEN THE FIRST WORLD LEADER TO PHONE PRESIDENT BUSH 
AFTER 9/11 TRAGEDY.  STILL, THERE WAS NO PROOF THAT A LINK 
BETWEEN 9/11 AND IRAQ EXISTED.  HE SAID: 
 
--  INSPECTORS WERE ACHIEVING TANGIBLE RESULTS; BAGHDAD HAD 
VIRTUALLY FULFILLED ALL CONDITIONS/TASKS WITH FEW OBSTACLES. 
 
-- THE PROCESS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE BASED ON AGREED 
TIMELINES IN PRIOR RESOLUTIONS; UNMOVIC,S AND IAEA'S WORK 
HAD NOT CONCLUDED BUT WAS MERELY SUSPENDED. 
 
-- THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE OTHER THAN RETURNING THE ISSUE OF 
IRAQ TO THE COUNCIL IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH A COMPREHENSIVE 
SETTLEMENT. 
 
-- NO PRIOR COUNCIL DECISIONS AUTHORIZED THE USE OF FORCE 
OUTSIDE THE UN CHARTER OR APPROVED THE VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF 
THE LEADERSHIP OF A SOVEREIGN STATE.  SUCH ACTIONS WOULD NOT 
HELP STRENGTHEN THE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION/SOLIDARITY 
NEEDED ON TERRORISM. 
 
-- A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT NEEDED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH 
INTERNATIONAL LAW. 
 
-- ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUFFERED A HUGE 
TRAGEDY; PRESIDENT PUTIN HAD BEEN THE FIRST WORLD LEADER TO 
PHONE PRESIDENT BUSH AND EXTEND SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT; 
SINCERE FEELINGS HAD BEEN FELT BY THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE. 
 
-- IF WAR IN IRAQ WAS IN RESPONSE TO DIRECT THREATS TO THE 
SECURITY OF THE U.S., THEN RUSSIA WOULD BE PREPARED TO 
ASSEMBLE ALL MEANS TO ELIMINATE THEM.  HOWEVER, THE COUNCIL 
WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO SUBSTANTIATE SUCH CLAIMS. 
 
 
CHINA: INSPECTIONS STILL POSSIBLE? 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶17. (C) IN A SLIGHTLY UNREAL INTERVENTION, CHINESE PERMREP 
WANG NOTED THAT UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA HAD SUBMITTED THE WORK 
PROGRAM AHEAD OF THE UNSCR 1284 SCHEDULE, AND OFFERED THE 
FOLLOWING COMMENTS: 
 
-- DUE TO RAPIDLY CHANGING EVENTS, THE EFFORTS OF THE COUNCIL 
HAD "FALLEN BEHIND."  INSPECTIONS HAD BEEN SUSPENDED. 
 
-- IN LIGHT OF PROGRESS ON INSPECTIONS, IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE 
TO ACHIEVE PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT.  THE INSPECTORS HAD 
SUBMITTED THE WORK PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDED SUGGESTIONS FOR 
MORE EFFECTIVE INSPECTIONS. 
 
-- THE SITUATION IN IRAQ WAS "WORRISOME:" A SITUATION IN 
WHICH WAR COULD BREAK OUT AT ANY MOMENT. 
 
-- CHINA HAD ALWAYS PURSUED A FOREIGN POLICY OF PEACE. 
 
-- CHINA WAS CONCERNED FOR PEACE AND SECURITY AND THE 
HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN IRAQ, AND WAS READY "WITH THE 
COUNCIL" TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE IRAQ ISSUE. 
 
-- THE COUNCIL BEARS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PEACE AND 
SECURITY AND MUST SHOULDER THAT RESPONSIBILITY IN ORDER NOT 
TO "LET DOWN" THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
 
 
GERMANY: "WE DO NOT LIVE ON VENUS, BUT 
RATHER, WE ARE THE SURVIVORS OF MARS" 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶18. (C) GERMAN FM FISCHER OFFERED A DECIDEDLY MORE EXPANSIVE 
STATEMENT THAN IN PREVIOUS COUNCIL MINISTERIAL MEETINGS; THE 
FULL TEXT OF HIS REMARKS IS REPORTED REF F.  HE SAID: 
 
-- THE SECURITY COUNCIL COULD NOT "REMAIN SILENT" IN THE 
CURRENT SITUATION; THE TASK AT HAND WAS TO SAFEGUARD ITS 
RELEVANCE AT A TIME WHEN RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAD BROUGHT THE 
WORK OF THE UN TO A STANDSTILL ON THE GROUND. 
 
-- PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ WAS STILL POSSIBLE DESPITE 
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BY WITHHOLDING RESOLUTION DEMANDS AND 
TIMELINES. 
 
-- TIME AND AGAIN, GERMANY HAD COLLABORATED WITH FRANCE AND 
RUSSIA TO PUT FORWARD PROPOSALS FOR MORE EFFICIENT 
INSPECTIONS. 
 
-- REAL PROGRESS HAD BEEN ACHIEVED:  IRAQ HAD SCRAPPED MANY 
OF ITS AL-SAMOUD MISSILES; 70 HAD NOW BEEN DESTROYED. 
 
-- THAT SAID, IRAQ,S READINESS TO COOPERATE WAS 
UNSATISFACTORY; IT WAS HESITANT AND SLOW.  THE COUNCIL AGREED 
ON THAT, BUT CAN THIS BE GROUNDS FOR WAR WITH ALL ITS 
TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES? 
 
-- WHY SHOULD WE DISBAND NOW PLANS TO DISARM IRAQ VIA 
PEACEFUL MEANS?  THE MAJORITY OF COUNCIL MEMBERS BELIEVED 
THERE WERE NO GROUNDS FOR BREAKING OFF THE DISARMAMENT 
PROCESS. 
 
-- THREE POINTS NEEDED TO BE EMPHASIZED:  FIRST, THE COUNCIL 
HAD NOT FAILED; WE "MUST COUNTER THAT MYTH."  THE COUNCIL IS 
NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING OUTSIDE THE UN. 
SECOND, WE HAVE TO STATE CLEARLY THAT UNDER THE CURRENT 
CIRCUMSTANCES THE POLICY OF MILITARY INTERVENTION HAS NO 
CREDIBILITY; IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF OUR PEOPLE; IT 
WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN MUCH TO SAFEGUARD THE UNITY OF THE 
COUNCIL; THERE IS NO BASIS IN THE UN CHARTER FOR REGIME 
CHANGE WITH MILITARY MEANS.  THIRD, THE INSPECTION REGIME 
NEEDED TO BE PRESERVED; RESOLUTIONS 1284 AND 1441 WERE STILL 
IN FORCE. 
 
-- THE UN AND COUNCIL NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO PLAY THE CENTRAL 
ROLE IN THE IRAQ CONFLICT; THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE. 
 
-- NEGOTIATIONS ON THE IRAQ CRISIS, FOLLOWED BY MILLIONS OF 
PEOPLE WORLDWIDE, REVEALED HOW RELEVANT AND INDISPENSABLE THE 
PEACEMAKING ROLE OF THE COUNCIL IS. 
 
-- GERMANY IS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT HUMANITARIAN 
CONSEQUENCES OF A WAR IN IRAQ - THE WORLD'S TASK NOW IS TO DO 
"EVERYTHING POSSIBLE" TO AVERT A HUMANITARIAN DISASTER. 
 
-- A LARGE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN GERMANY AND EUROPE ARE 
GREATLY TROUBLED BY THE IMPENDING WAR; EUROPE HAD EXPERIENCED 
THE HORRORS OF WAR ONLY TOO OFTEN.  THOSE WHO KNOW OUR 
EUROPEAN HISTORY UNDERSTAND THAT "WE DO NOT LIVE ON VENUS 
BUT, RATHER, WE ARE THE SURVIVORS OF MARS."  WAR IS TERRIBLE. 
 IT IS A GREAT TRAGEDY FOR THOSE AFFECTED AND FOR US ALL. 
 
-- NEVERTHELESS, GERMANY HAD ACCEPTED THE NECESSITY FOR WAR 
ON TWO OCCASIONS DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS BECAUSE ALL 
PEACEFUL ALTERNATIVES HAD PROVED UNSUCCESSFUL:  IN KOSOVO AND 
IN AFGHANISTAN. 
 
 
SYRIA: RHETORIC FLOWS, DOUBLE STANDARD 
ON ISRAEL, OBJECTIVE IS CONTROL OF OIL 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶19. (C) SYRIAN FM SHARA MADE A LENGTHY RHETORICAL STATEMENT, 
SAYING: 
 
-- THIS WAS A SAD AND PAINFUL MOMENT.  NOTHING TO BE SAID 
COULD ADDRESS THE VICTIMS OF WAR. 
 
-- THE UN CHARTER OPENS:  "WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS, DETERMINED TO SAVE SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS FROM THE 
SCOURGE OF WAR, WHICH TWICE IN OUR LIFETIME HAS BROUGHT 
UNTOLD SORROW TO MANKIND... UNITE OUR STRENGTH TO MAINTAIN 
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY."  THIS WAS THE IMPORTANT 
COMMITMENT CONSECRATED IN THE CHARTER 58 YEARS AGO, SIGNED IN 
SAN FRANCISCO IN 1945.  A HISTORIC MONUMENT WAS BUILT TO THE 
CHARTER IN NEW YORK.  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO LIVE BETWEEN 
THE EAST AND WEST COASTS ARE IN PLURALITY AND DIVERSITY A 
MICROCOSM OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, MORE THAN ANYWHERE 
ELSE IN THE WORLD. 
 
-- THE QUESTION WAS, WHETHER FOR IRAQ OR THE FORGOTTEN 
PALESTINIAN CAUSE, COULD THE U.S. AND THE UK ABSOLVE 
THEMSELVES OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR CATASTROPHIC OUTCOME?  THE 
UN WAS WITNESS TO HISTORY.  COULD THE U.S. USE DIFFERENCES IN 
FINDING A CONSTRUCTIVE SOLUTION IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL AS AN 
EXCUSE TO WAGE WAR?  WHEN WAS PEACE EASY? 
 
-- WITHIN HOURS, A WAR OF AGGRESSION WILL BE UNLEASHED, AS 
DECLARED IN WASHINGTON.  THOSE WITH VISION AND INSIGHT WILL 
DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS DECISION WOULD RETURN TO HAUNT... 
 
-- THIS WAR WAGED TO DISARM IRAQ OF WMD WAS INCONSISTENT WITH 
ISRAEL'S STOCKPILE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. IF INTERNATIONAL 
MONITORING AND INSPECTIONS PROCESSES MONITORED IRAQ, THEN 
SHOULD THEY NOT ALSO BE APPLIED TO ISRAEL" 
 
-- SYRIA VOTED "YES" FOR 1441 BECAUSE IT BELIEVED IN AN 
INTERNATIONAL SOLUTION AND ULTIMATELY THE INTERNATIONAL 
INSPECTIONS PROCESS YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS. 
 
-- TO CALL INTO QUESTION THE ROLE OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL OR 
THE UN OR ANY ATTEMPT TO BLAME ANY MEMBER IGNORED THAT THE 
MAJORITY OF NATIONS REJECTED THE USE OF FORCE AND THERE WAS 
NO NEED TO VETO A RESOLUTION. 
 
-- UNSCR 1441'S OP12, WHICH DEMANDED THAT THE COUNCIL BE 
CONVENED, WAS IGNORED.  THIS MADE CLEAR THAT THE OBJECTIVE 
WAS OCCUPATION AND EXPLOITATION OF IRAQI NATIONAL RESOURCES 
IN CONTRAVENTION OF ALL INTERNATIONAL LAW. 
 
-- HOW COULD ONE DENY THAT IRAQ WAS COOPERATING?  ALL HAD 
SEEN THE DESTRUCTION OF AL-SAMOUDS. 
 
-- AMERICAN RECORDS WHICH CITE DANGER TO U.S. INTERESTS AND 
AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM MORE THAN 150 COUNTRIES WITH AL-QAEDA 
SLEEPER CELLS ALSO INDICATE THE U.S. HAS THE BIGGEST ARSENAL 
OF WMD. 
 
-- IF THE U.S. FORGETS THE PALESTINIANS, HOW COULD IT FORGET 
RACHEL CORRIE, CRUSHED TO DEATH BY ISRAEL?  THE VIEWS OF 
MILLIONS IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WERE CLEAR IN THE 
WORLD DEMONSTRATIONS. 
 
-- THE OPTION OF PEACE WAS STILL AVAILABLE.  THE PROSPERITY 
OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN PEOPLES WAS STILL AVAILABLE, AND COULD 
SAVE THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF IRAQI PEOPLE IN DEFIANCE OF THE 
OCCUPIER. 
 
 
PAKISTAN: TYPICAL NUANCE 
------------------------- 
 
¶20. (C) PAKISTANI PERMREP AKRAM SHOWED NO CARDS IN HIS 
INTERVENTION, NUANCING PAKISTAN'S POSITION CAREFULLY.  WAR IS 
ALWAYS A HUMAN TRAGEDY, HE QUOTED THE SYG; PAKISTAN HAD THUS 
ADVOCATED A PEACEFUL SOLUTION AND EXHAUSTING ALL OTHER MEANS 
BEFORE MOVING TO THE USE OF FORCE.  THE UNMOVIC / IAEA DRAFT 
PROGRAM OF WORK COULD HAVE PROVIDED A USEFUL BASIS FOR THE 
DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, "IF IRAQ'S FULL, ACTIVE, AND 
UNCONDITIONAL COOPERATION COULD HAVE BEEN SECURED IN TIME." 
IT WAS REGRETTABLE THAT "OBVIOUSLY, THE DRAFT PROGRAM OF WORK 
COULD NOT BE PURSUED AT THIS TIME."  RECALLING THAT, WHILE 
"THE WHOLE WORLD HAD BEEN RIVETED ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL," 
MEMBERS SEPARATED BY "HONEST DIFFERENCES" HAD NOT BEEN "IN A 
POSITION TO TRAVERSE THIS PATH TOGETHER;" THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL NONETHELESS REMAINED RELEVANT AND MUST UPHOLD THE 
INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK.  THE COUNCIL SHOULD SEEK TO 
IMPLEMENT ALL ITS RESOLUTIONS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE RELATED TO 
THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND KASHMIR, "WHERE PEOPLE HAVE 
STRUGGLED AND DIED FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS," HE ADDED.  THAT 
SAID, THE COUNCIL WOULD BE REORIENTED IN THE DAYS TO COME BY 
URGENT HUMANITARIAN TASKS.  IN THAT CONTEXT, THE COUNCIL 
SHOULD CONSIDER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE SYG'S HUMANITARIAN 
PROPOSALS WHEN RECEIVED.  PAKISTAN WOULD WORK IN SOLIDARITY 
WITH ITS IRAQI "BROTHERS AND SISTERS" TO ENSURE THAT THERE 
WOULD BE NO DELAY OR PROCRASTINATION TO EXACERBATE THEIR 
SUFFERING.  "EVEN ONCE GUNS SPEAK," THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONTAINING HUMANITARIAN SUFFERING, 
ENSURING UNITY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, AND THE STABILITY 
OF THE REGION AND WORLD WOULD NOT END.  THE PROCESS OF 
"HEALING THE WOUNDS TO DATE AND TO COME COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED 
IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND THROUGH THE UN." 
 
 
MEXICO: NOT TIME FOR RECRIMINATION BUT... 
DEFENSIVE OF THE COUNCIL 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶21. (C) IN USUAL FASHION, MEXICAN PERMREP AGUILAR-ZINSER 
DEPLORED THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO CONTINUE JOINTLY THE 
DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ, BUT SAID THAT SITUATION DID NOT 
CONSTITUTE AN OBSTACLE TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL'S DISCHARGE OF 
ITS RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE WORLD.  HE CONTINUED: 
 
-- MEXICO UPHOLDS A MULTILATERAL PATH FOR THE RESOLUTION OF 
CONFLICT; PRESIDENT FOX HAD SAID THE WORLD MUST CONTINUE TO 
UPHOLD THE SPIRIT AND LETTER OF THE CHARTER.  THE USE OF 
FORCE WAS ONLY JUSTIFIED AS A LAST RESORT. 
 
-- THE SECURITY COUNCIL IS THE ONLY ORGAN TO WHICH THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS ENTRUSTED WITH THE RIGHT TO 
AUTHORIZE FORCE.  AT STAKE WAS THE VERY MANNER IN WHICH 
HUMANKIND ADDRESSES QUESTIONS OF WMD AND PROLIFERATION. 
 
-- MEXICO WAS A DEEPLY PACIFIST AND PEACEFUL STATE.  THE 
TOUCHSTONE OF THE PRINCIPLES TO WHICH MEXICO ADHERED WAS THE 
PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES AND THE MULTILATERAL 
APPLICATION OF POLICY. 
 
-- THE UN WAS THE FORUM "PAR EXCELLENCE" WHICH PRESERVES OR 
RESTORES PEACE, WHICH PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN OR 
CHILDREN OR THE DISABLED, THE ENVIRONMENT, THE SPREAD AGAINST 
DISEASE, AND WHICH HAD THE STRENGTH AND LEGITIMACY OF ITS 
MANDATE. 
 
-- THIS CURRENT, MOST ROBUST ATTEMPT AT DISARMAMENT COULD 
HAVE SUCCEEDED.  THERE WAS NO TIME FOR RECRIMINATION BUT IT 
WAS TIME TO ANALYZE THE TASKS AHEAD WITH A CLEAR SENSE OF 
RESPONSIBILITIES AND CHALLENGES AHEAD. 
 
 
CHILE: BITTER EXAMINATION OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶22. (C) CHILEAN PERMREP VALDES SAID THAT CHILE HAD EXAMINED 
THE PROGRAM OF WORK WITH BITTERNESS BECAUSE "WHAT MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN WAS PEACE, AND THAT WAS NOT TO BE."  CHILE HAD WISHED 
FOR A PEACEFUL SOLUTION AND HAD ENDEAVORED TO IDENTIFY A PATH 
TO THAT.  HE SAID: 
 
-- STRENGTHENED AND ACTIVE INSPECTIONS ACCOMPANIED BY ROBUST 
MILITARY PRESSURE WERE CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING A PEACEFUL 
SOLUTION. 
 
-- THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CURRENT SITUATION WERE SERIOUS FOR 
HUMANITY:  THE IRAQI REGIME NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE PRICE IT 
WOULD HAVE TO PAY. 
 
-- EACH COUNCIL MEMBER MUST SHOULDER RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
FAILING TO FIND A PATH OF COLLECTIVE ACTION, ALTHOUGH TODAY 
WAS NOT A DAY FOR RECRIMINATION. 
 
-- THE INSPECTORS DESERVED TRIBUTE, AS THEY WERE ABLE TO 
"EXTRACT TRUTHS AND PLACE THEM BOLDLY" BEFORE THE COUNCIL. 
THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBTS ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF INSPECTIONS; 
CHILE BELIEVED IN THE VALUE OF THE INSPECTIONS PROCESS AS A 
TOOL FOR DISARMAMENT. 
 
-- WAR WILL BRING HORROR UPON MILLIONS OF IRAQIS:  THE 
COUNCIL WILL HAVE TO WORK TIRELESSLY TO SAVE LIVES. 
 
 
ANGOLA: IRAQ DID NOT COMPLY 
--------------------------- 
 
¶23. (C) ANGOLAN MINISTER MIRANDA DEPLORED THE FAILURE OF 
INSPECTIONS TO HAVE DISARMED IRAQ, AND DEPLORED AS WELL THAT 
IRAQ WAS UNABLE TO AVAIL ITSELF OF ITS LAST OPPORTUNITY TO 
COMPLY.  IRAQ DID NOT COMPLY WITH UNSCRS, IN PARTICULAR 1441, 
GOVERNING ITS PEACEFUL DISARMAMENT, OR ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IT WAS MAKING A GENUINE 
EFFORT TO DISARM.  ANGOLA DEFENDED PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS TO 
CONFLICT AND BELIEVED IN THE USE OF FORCE ONLY AS THE LAST 
RESORT.  FOUR DECADES OF CONFLICT IN ANGOLA HAD LED THEM TO 
THE PRIMACY OF THIS BELIEF.  IN ADDITION: 
 
-- THE SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY INSTRUMENT OF 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
 
-- WAR IS NOW INEVITABLE; THEREFORE, THE HUMANITARIAN 
CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE OF CONCERN, SINCE INNOCENTS WERE ALWAYS 
MOST AFFECTED BY WAR.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD 
MUSTER THE RESOURCES FOR HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO BE 
DEPLOYED WHEN THE CONFLICT WAS OVER. 
 
-- THE SECURITY COUNCIL, TOGETHER WITH THE BROADER UN SYSTEM, 
WOULD FACE THE IMMENSE TASK OF RECONSTRUCTION. 
 
 
CAMEROON: EACH AND EVERY ONE TO BLAME 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶24. (C) CAMEROONIAN PERMREP BELINGA-EBOUTOU SAID THAT THE 
COUNCIL WAS AT A CROSS-ROADS, AND ALTHOUGH THERE HAD BEEN 
HOPE FOR A LAST MINUTE MIRACLE, A "COLLECTIVE COMING TO OUR 
SENSES" HAD NOT OCCURRED.  "WE ARE EACH AND EVERY ONE TO 
BLAME; ALL WERE WRONG, AND ALL WERE RIGHT."  DISARMAMENT ON 
THE PRINCIPLE OF INSPECTIONS WAS OVER.  CAMEROON PAID HOMAGE 
TO THE INSPECTORS, WHO HAD JUSTIFIED THE TRUST PLACED IN 
THEM.  THE COUNCIL WOULD ENTRUST TO THEM NEW TASKS IN THE 
FUTURE, WHETHER IN THIS CONTEXT OR IN OTHERS.  THE DRAFT 
PROGRAM OF WORK COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD BASIS.  BUT DESPITE 
THE IDENTIFICATION OF KRDTS, CAMEROON DID NOT SEE HOW, ABSENT 
FULL, ACTIVE AND UNCONDITIONAL COOPERATION ON THE PART OF 
IRAQ, THAT INSPECTIONS COULD HAVE COMPLETED THOSE TASKS.  THE 
COUNCIL MUST CONSIDER THE HUMANITARIAN IMPACT OF THE DE FACTO 
SUSPENSION OF THE OFF PROGRAM.  CAMEROON APPROVED THE SYG'S 
DECISION TO REMOVE UN STAFF FOR THEIR SAFETY.  BUT GIVEN THE 
IMPACT ON THE IRAQI POPULATION, CAMEROON SUGGESTED THAT THE 
661 COMMITTEE MEET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AT THE PERMREP LEVEL 
ON THE BASIS OF THE SYG'S PROPOSALS (NOTE: WHICH ARE STILL 
FORTHCOMING.  END NOTE.).  FINALLY, CAMEROON HOPED THAT TRUST 
WITHIN THE COUNCIL COULD SOON BE REVIVED. 
 
 
GUINEA: MORAL NECESSITY TO RID WORLD OF WMD 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶25. (C) COUNCIL PRESIDENT AND GUINEAN FM FALL MADE AN 
EXTREMELY BRIEF STATEMENT IN HIS NATIONAL CAPACITY.  HE SAID: 
 
-- THE COUNCIL HAD EXAMINED BUT COULD NOT ACHIEVE CONSENSUS 
ON A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES WITH REGARD TO THE CURRENT 
SITUATION. 
 
-- THE INSPECTORS DESERVED THE THANKS OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE 
PROGRAM OF WORK AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE KRDTS. 
 
-- GUINEA NOTED THE SYG'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW INSPECTORS 
BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY SITUATION. 
 
-- WAS THERE, THEN, NO ROOM FOR HOPE?  IF ARMED CONFLICT WAS 
INEVITABLE, STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO LIMIT THE MAGNITUDE OF 
THE RECONSTRUCTION TASK AND TO SAFEGUARD THE HUMANITARIAN 
SITUATION OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE. 
 
-- GUINEA UNDERSTOOD THE MORAL NECESSITY OF RIDDING THE WORLD 
OF WMD.  SUCH ACTION WAS NECESSARY TO THE MAINTENANCE OF 
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. 
 
-- MORE THAN EVER, IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO SEE SECURITY 
COUNCIL UNITY. 
 
 
IRAQ:  UNREPENTANT 
------------------ 
 
¶26. (U) AN UNREPENTANT IRAQI PR AL-DURI (FULL REMARKS IN REF 
G) THANKED COUNCIL MEMBERS THAT HAD OPPOSED THE U.S. / UK / 
SPANISH DRAFT RESOLUTION AND TOOK ON THE U.S., UK, AND SPAIN 
FOR THEIR EFFORTS IN THE COUNCIL.  HE SAID IRAQ HAD NO WMD 
AND THE COMING DAYS WOULD PROVE IT.  AL-DURI CRITICIZED U.S. 
AID PLANS FOR IRAQ, REMARKING THAT "THE EXECUTIONER CANNOT 
HELP THE VICTIM EXCEPT BY KILLING HIM."  ELABORATING HE SAID 
THE IRAQI PEOPLE WOULD NOT NEED HUMANITARIAN AID BUT FOR 
IMMINENT U.S. / UK MILITARY ACTION.  HE REJECTED U.S. AID ON 
BEHALF OF IRAQ.  HE SAID THAT THE TRUE GOALS OF THE U.S. HAD 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SEARCH FOR WMD AND INSTEAD WERE 
FOCUSED ON OCCUPYING IRAQ AND CONTROLLING ITS OIL FIELDS.
