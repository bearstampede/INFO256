SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  IRAQ ISRAEL 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  WARNING AGAINST ISRAELI PENETRATION IN IRAQ AND 
EUROPEAN OPINION REGARDING ISRAEL DOMINATED COVERAGE IN UAE PRINT 
AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.  AN EDITORIAL IN "AL KHALEEJ" NOTED THAT 
THE EUROPEAN OPINION IS RESPECTED AT TIMES AND NEGLECTED AT 
OTHERS.  ANOTHER EDITORIAL IN "AL BAYAN" NOTED ISRAEL'S ATTEMPTS 
TO SNEAK INTO IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  COMMENTING ON EUROPEAN PUBLIC OPINION, THAT IS RESPECTED AT 
TIMES AND NEGLECTED AT OTHERS, SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AL- 
KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED 11/05: 
 
"... THE REASON IS THAT WESTERN DEMOCRACY BECOMES CRIPPLED AND 
ONE-EYED, AND SOMETIMES PARALYZED AND BLIND WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
ZIONIST ENTITY AND ITS BABYSITTER THE U.S., AND THAT IS BECAUSE 
OF THE FEAR OF HAVING THE SWORD OF 'ANTI SEMITISM' ON THE NECKS 
AND THIS IS USED BY ISRAEL TO DOMINATE THE WORLD... WHAT IS ALSO 
SHAMEFUL IS THAT EUROPE IS DEPRIVING ITS PEOPLE OF THEIR RIGHT OF 
EXPRESSING THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID TO MAKE ISRAEL AND 
THE U.S. ANGRY." 
 
¶3.  NOTING THAT THE IRAQI GOVERNING COUNCIL'S STATEMENT REGARDING 
THE NON-EXISTENCE OF ISRAEL IN IRAQ IS NOT TRUE, "AL KHALEEJ" 
EDITORIALIZED 11/04: 
 
"... ISRAEL IN IRAQ IS A PRACTICAL TRANSLATION OF THE AMERICAN 
OCCUPATION OF THIS COUNTRY (IRAQ).  HOPES ARE ON THE IRAQI PEOPLE 
TO LIBERATE ITS COUNTRY FROM THE OCCUPATION AND THE ZIONIST 
INVASION PARALLEL TO IT." 
 
¶4.  COMMENTING ON ISRAEL'S ATTEMPTS TO SNEAK INTO IRAQ, DUBAI- 
BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" EDITORIALIZED 11/04: 
 
"... THE HOSTILE HEBREW COUNTRY IS SEEKING TO GRADUALLY SNEAK 
INTO THE LAND OF THE EUPHRATES.  THERE IS ISRAELI RESEARCH THAT 
SAYS THAT THE ZIONIST ENTITY WILL EARN A PROFIT OF 17.5 BILLION 
DOLLARS IN FIVE YEARS AS A RESULT OF THE OCCUPATION OF IRAQ.  WE 
ARE RINGING THE GONG OF DANGER.. IRAQ, WHICH WE EXPECT TO GATHER 
UP ITS WOUNDS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, IS A TARGET FOR ZIONISTS WHO 
ARE USED TO SNEAK INTO AREAS TO ACHIEVE THEIR DIRTY GOALS."
