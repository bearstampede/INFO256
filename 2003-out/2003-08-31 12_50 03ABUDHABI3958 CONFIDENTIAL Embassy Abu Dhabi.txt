REF: STATE 225052 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Charge d'Affaires, a.i. Richard A. 
Albright for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (C) Charge d'Affaires delivered ref information on 
pending terrorist financing cases to UAE Central Bank 
Governor Sultan Nasser Al-Suweidi 8/27 and expressed the 
USG's appreciation for the UAE's continuing cooperation in 
the area of terrorist financing.  Al-Suweidi responded that 
he was very happy to receive the information and noted that 
it "would be very helpful" in clearing up a number of 
pending cases currently with the public prosecutor. 
 
¶3.  Comment:  By law, the UAE Central Bank can freeze the 
assets of a bank account for seven days, but then must 
release the funds or present evidence to the public 
prosecutor charging the account holder with a crime.  The 
UAE Central Bank has frozen a number of accounts in the UAE 
-- at USG request -- indefinitely and always is eager to 
receive additional information from us that indemnifies the 
Bank.  End comment.
