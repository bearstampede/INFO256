SUBJECT: CANADA WON'T SUPPORT OAS QUOTA PAYMENT INCREASE 
 
REF: STATE 50110 
 
Embassy delivered reftel talking points to Alison Benn, OAS 
coordinator in the Inter-American Division of DFAIT's Latin 
America and Caribbean Bureau, on March 4.  Benn told poloff 
at that time that the question of increasing Canada's OAS 
quota payment had not yet been discussed at DFAIT. In a 
follow-up discussion March 14, Benn advised poloff that 
Canada will not support an OAS quota payment increase at this 
time. Benn said that Canada wants to see greater 
accountability on OAS's part. She indicated that before 
Canada would agree a quota increase is necessary, it would 
have to do further research to identify what OAS costs are 
increasing, and why they are increasing. (Note: in an 
off-the-record comment, Benn (please protect) said she found 
it ironic that Brazil and the U.S. were leading this effort, 
as they had been in arrears on their OAS assessments. End 
note.)
