SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR WITH IRAQ; HARARE 
 
 
  ¶1.   Under headline "Al Jazeera and the war in Iraq" 
      the pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" 
      dedicated its March 30 editorial to hailing the 
      Arabic language television network Al Jazeera's 
      coverage of the United States-led war against Iraq. 
      "While the U.S. and its allies were absolutely 
      unchallenged on the propaganda battlefront in the 
      1991 Gulf War, this time round the world can be 
      assured of an alternative view on the ongoing war," 
      the paper stated.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .The UK/U.S. propaganda war strategy has 
      suffered a major setback with Al Jazeera's prominent 
      and competing coverage of the war in Iraq.  While the 
      U.S. has bludgeoned virtually everyone with high- 
      sounding claims of its avowed support for media 
      freedom, events currently unfolding do not exactly 
      manifest Uncle Sam's love for press freedom.  On 
      March 24, Al Jazeera launched an English-language Web 
      site that almost immediately fell victim to hackers. 
      . .  All this because Al Jazeera has broken the 
      U.S./UK propaganda monopoly. . . While the U.S. and 
      its allies were absolutely unchallenged on the 
      propaganda battlefront in the 1991 Gulf War, this 
      time round the world can be assured of an alternative 
      view on the ongoing war."
