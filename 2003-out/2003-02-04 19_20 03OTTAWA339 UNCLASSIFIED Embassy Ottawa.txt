¶1. Econoff discussed the latest evolution in GOC thinking on 
TRIPS and medicines with Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade IPR Director Catherine Dickson on January 
¶30.  Dickson reaffirmed the assurances given by Trade 
Minister Pettigrew in his January 10 phone conversation with 
USTR Zoellick and the position announced by the Canadian 
delegation at the January 28 informal TRIPS Council meeting. 
 
¶2.  Canada remains disappointed that the TRIPS Council did 
not resolve the issue by the December 2002 deadline, but 
shares the USG commitment to finding a long-term, 
multilateral solution to the problem.  In the meantime, said 
Dickson, the GOC will not take dispute settlement action 
against any poor country that needs access to medicines to 
treat a public health crisis (e.g., HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, 
malaria) but has limited or no manufacturing capablity. 
 
¶3.  Dickson underscored the Canadian position in writing via 
Ref B, which she copied to USTR's Claude Burcky.
