¶1. (U) The local press reported that three hundred 
expatriate workers at an Abu Dhabi-based construction 
company gathered at the Ministry of Labor and Social 
Affairs on April 28 to protest their employer's 
failure to pay salaries for more than three months. 
The Minister of Labor Matar Humaid Al-Tayer personally 
intervened asking the Workers Disputes Section to 
respond to the complaint. The employer was summoned to 
the Ministry and agreed to immediately pay one month's 
salary, promising to pay the rest of the wages in 
installments over a short period of time if the 
workers withdrew their complaint.  The workers "asked 
for time to think about it and reply to the ministry" 
and selected representatives to negotiate with the 
Ministry and the employer. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Work stoppages due to the failure of 
employers to pay wages continue to be mediated by the 
Ministry and receive significant press coverage. (See 
reftels A and B).  Though the law does not technically 
permit laborers to conduct work stoppages/strikes, 
Ministry officials tend to react sympathetically, 
particularly in cases of non-payment of wages, and 
urge employees to go to the Workers Dispute Section 
with their problems. While these informal mechanisms 
for dispute resolution function adequately, the 
government is also moving forward with legislation to 
formally recognize unions and clearly define their 
roles. (See reftel C).
