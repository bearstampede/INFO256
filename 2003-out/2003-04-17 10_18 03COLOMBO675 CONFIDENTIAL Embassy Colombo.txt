SUBJECT:  Mission conveys points on fleeing Iraqi regime 
officials; GSL responds positively to points 
 
Ref:  State 98747 
 
(U) Classified by Lewis Amselem, Deputy Chief of 
Mission.  Reasons 1.5 (b, d) 
 
¶1.  (C) Per Reftel, Mission has conveyed the points on 
fleeing Iraqi regime officials to the Sri Lankan and 
Maldivian Governments.  Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary 
Nihal Rodrigo assured the Ambassador that if the GSL had 
any information that a former Saddam official was trying 
to enter Sri Lanka the U.S. Embassy would be the first 
to know.  Rodrigo added that the GSL is now preventing 
any monetary transfers into or out of Sri Lanka 
involving the local Iraqi embassy.  The GSL is 
permitting internal monetary transactions, however, so 
that the embassy can continue to operate. 
 
¶2.  (C) The Maldivian government has not yet responded to 
our points, but we expect it will be cooperative on this 
important matter. 
 
¶3.  (U) Minimize considered.
