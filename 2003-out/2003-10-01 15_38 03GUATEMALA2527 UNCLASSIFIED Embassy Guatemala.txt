Per ref A instructions, we followed up on our earlier 
demarche (ref B) with Sylvia Corado, Director for 
Multilateral Affairs at the Foreign Ministry on September 29. 
 Corado indicated that the MFA had reviewed the statement of 
interdiction principles and was consulting internally and 
with other affected ministries on how Guatemala could 
contribute to the Proliferation Security Initiative.  She 
said the MFA would inform us once the GOG has decided its 
position on this matter.
