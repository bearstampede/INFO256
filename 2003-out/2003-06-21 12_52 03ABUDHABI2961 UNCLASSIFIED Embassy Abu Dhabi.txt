SUBJECT: UAE SIGNS WILDLIFE PACT WITH BAHRAIN 
 
REF: ABU DHABI 1960 
 
¶1. (U) Local press reported on June 17 that the Abu 
Dhabi Environmental Research and Wildlife Development 
Agency (ERWDA) signed an agreement to cooperate on 
environmental and wildlife protection with the 
Bahraini General Commission for the Protection of 
Marine Resources, Environment and Wildlife. The pact 
runs for three years, and the UAE wildlife authority 
agreed to work with its counterpart in Bahrain to 
conduct research, manage and assess fish stocks, and 
protect wild plants and endangered species. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: This pact is a welcome development 
as we have not seen any recent cross-border 
collaboration on environmental issues. To meaningfully 
manage the environment -- especially the heavily 
depleted fish stocks of the Persian Gulf -- countries 
in the region need to increase their level of 
cooperation and coordination with each other (see 
reftel).  End comment.
