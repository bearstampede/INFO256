NOMINATING-OFFICER: Joe Novak 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Ven. Assaji Thero is a bit unusual among the Buddhist 
clergy because of his regular contact with individuals 
who are not Sinhala Buddhists.  His temple is 
conducting IT training for all sections of the 
community.  Part of the difficulty of the peace process 
is a lack of understanding  and communication between 
the different ethnic groups in Sri Lanka.  Through 
constant contacts with all sections of society, Ven. 
Assaji Thero is doing his part in bridging differences 
and establishing mutual understanding between the 
Sinhala, the Tamil and the Muslim communities.  Post 
can further promote these activities which promote 
social stability by exposing Ven. Assaji Thero to the 
concepts behind multiculturalism and religious 
diversity in the U.S. 
Ven. Assaji Thero, who belongs to the Malwatte chapter 
of the Buddhist establishment, is also an important 
contact for the Mission.  He is a resident of the 
Gangarama Temple, which is closely affiliated to a 
number of senior politicians of the governing United 
National Party. 
Post believes that Ven Assaji Thero will be an ideal 
candidate for participation in SA/RP on "Religious 
Diversity in the U.S."  since his exposure to the U.S. 
and to this project will bring a multiplier effect.
