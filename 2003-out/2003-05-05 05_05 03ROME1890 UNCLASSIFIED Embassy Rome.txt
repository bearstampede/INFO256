¶1.  SUMMARY:  THE BUREAU OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL WORKING 
GROUP (IGWG) FOR THE ELABORATION OF VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES 
TO SUPPORT THE PROGRESSIVE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT TO 
ADEQUATE FOOD IN THE CONTEXT OF NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY 
MET APRIL 28, 2003.  THE BUREAU PROVIDED GUIDANCE TO THE 
SECRETARIAT ON PROPOSED INTERSESSIONAL ACTIVITIES, 
 
SIPDIS 
STRESSING THE NEED TO KEEP WITHIN THE IGWG'S MANDATE, AND 
TO AVOID TOPICS (SUCH AS "THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION"), 
WHICH LAY OUTSIDE THE MANDATE. THE BUREAU AGREED THAT A 
BRIEFING BY UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD, 
JEAN ZIEGLER, WAS NOT NECESSARY.  USDEL AND OTHER OECD 
BUREAU MEMBERS WERE SURPRISED BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE 
FAO LEGAL OFFICER SUPPORTING THE BUREAU'S WORK ARGUED FOR 
BROADENING THE SCOPE OF THE VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES BEYOND 
NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY.  WITHIN THE BUREAU THERE IS 
GENERAL AGREEMENT NOT TO RE-OPEN THE DEBATE ON THIS 
QUESTION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  THE BUREAU OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL WORKING GROUP 
(IGWG) FOR THE ELABORATION OF VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES TO 
SUPPORT THE PROGRESSIVE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT TO 
ADEQUATE FOOD (R2F) IN THE CONTEXT OF NATIONAL FOOD 
SECURITY MET APRIL 28, 2003. BUREAU MEMBERS IRAN (CHAIR), 
U.S., BELGIUM, NEW ZEALAND AND MALI PARTICIPATED.  THE 
PHILIPPINES AND BRAZIL WERE ABSENT. 
 
¶3. ASSISTANT DIRECTOR GENERAL (ADG) HARTWIG DE HAEN 
OPENED THE MEETING BY ASKING BUREAU VIEWS ON WHETHER THE 
IGWG SHOULD BE "A SEPARATE SUB-ITEM" FOR THE 124TH FAO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01890  01 OF 03  050506Z 
COUNCIL SESSION IN JUNE.  THE BUREAU AGREED THAT THIS WAS 
NOT A NECESSARY; MEMBERS WHO WANTED TO COMMENT ON THE 
IGWG COULD DO SO IN THE ITEM "REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON 
WORLD FOOD SECURITY" (TO WHICH THE IGWG ITSELF REPORTS). 
COMMENT: IT TURNS OUT THAT THE AGENDA HAD ALREADY BEEN 
PRINTED UP WITH THE IGWG AS A SUB-ITEM, SO THE ADG'S 
"CONSULTATION" WAS MOOT (AND PROBABLY AN AFTER THOUGHT). 
END COMMENT. 
 
¶4.  THE BUREAU APPROVED THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING 
HELD ON THE LAST DAY OF THE IGWG.  THE FINAL VERSION 
REFLECTED U.S.-PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE DRAFT MINUTES. 
 
¶5.  THE BUREAU DISCUSSED A LIST OF PROPOSED 
INTERSESSIONAL ACTIVITIES DRAWN UP BY THE IGWG SECRETARY 
BASED ON INPUTS FROM THE BUREAU AT ITS LAST SESSION AND 
MEMBER COMMENTS AT THE IGWG SESSION.  THE SECRETARY 
INFORMED THE GROUP THAT DONORS WERE READY TO PROVIDE 
EXTRA-BUDGETARY FUNDING.  THE ACTIVITIES WERE PRICED AS 
FOLLOWS: 
 
-- USD 160,000 FOR 8 TECHNICAL PAPERS (R2F IN PRACTICE; 
R2F AND THE COVENANT ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL 
(ESC) RIGHTS; MONITORING THE RIGHT TO FOOD, TARGETING 
VULNERABLE GROUPS; THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION OF R2F, 
SOCIAL SAFETY NETS; JUSTICIABILITY OF THE R2F AND FOOD 
SOVEREIGNTY; 
-- USD 180,000 FOR 6 CASE STUDIES (MALI, BRAZIL, INDIA, 
NEPAL, SOUTH AFRICA AND UGANDA); 
-- USD 300,000 FOR A REGIONAL MEETING OR EXPERT 
CONSULTATION; AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01890  01 OF 03  050506Z 
-- USD 1,200 FOR A PRESENTATION BY UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
JEAN ZIEGLER. 
 
¶6.  BRAZIL (BY CORRESPONDENCE) EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR 
INTERSESSIONAL PAPERS ON "SOCIAL SAFETY NETS," "CASE 
STUDIES" AND "TARGETING AND REACHING DISADVANTAGED AND 
VULNERABLE GROUPS."  THE U.S. AND BELGIUM ALSO SUPPORTED 
THESE TOPICS.  MALI EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR ALL OF THE 
PROPOSALS, BUT STATED THAT GETTING DOWN TO DRAFTING THE 
GUIDELINES WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN COMMISSIONING A LOT OF 
PAPERS. 
 
THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION 
--------------------------- 
¶7. THE U.S., BELGIUM AND NEW ZEALAND ARGUED STRONGLY THAT 
THE PROPOSED PAPER ON "THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION (WHICH 
INCLUDED, INTER ALIA, SUB-TOPICS ON  "EXTRANATIONAL 
OBLIGATIONS OF STATES" AND "R2F PRINCIPLES VIS A VIS 
RULES GOVERNING INTERNATIONAL TRADE") WAS NOT WITHIN THE 
MANDATE OF THE IGWG.  SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY, THE 
STRONGEST ADVOCATE FOR INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL 
DIMENSION ALONG THESE LINES WAS THE FAO LEGAL OFFICER WHO

PAGE 02        ROME  01890  02 OF 03  050507Z 
ARGUED THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS CONSISTENT WITH AND 
NECESSARY BECAUSE OF COMMENT 12 OF THE COVENANT ON 
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS (WHICH COVERS THE 
INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION).  USDEL RESPONDED THAT THE IGWG 
HAD NO MANDATE TO COVER ALL OF COMMENT 12 AND NEEDED TO 
BE LIMITED TO THE NATIONAL CONTEXT.  THE U.S. AND NEW 
ZEALAND ALSO STATED THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THE SCOPE OF 
THE IGWG HAD CONCLUDED AT THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT FIVE 
YEARS LATER MEETING AND SHOULD NOT BE REOPENED. 
 
¶8.  THE BUREAU DID AGREE THAT THE NATIONAL POLICIES TAKE 
PLACE IN AN INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT, AND AGREED THAT THE 
"INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION" MIGHT BETTER BE COVERED WITH 
DISCUSSION OF TOPICS SUCH AS "AT WHAT POINT DO COUNTRIES 
REQUIRE OR REQUEST INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO FULFILL 
NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY NEEDS;" AND "WHAT WAS THE ROLE AND 
RESPONSIBILITY OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND STATES 
AS MEMBERS OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO RESPOND TO 
COUNTRY REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE." 
 
¶9.  THE U.S. NOTED THAT THE U.S. SIDE EVENT ON FOOD 
SAFETY NETS TO BE HELD DURING THE UPCOMING COMMITTEE ON 
WORLD FOOD SECURITY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CONTRIBUTION 
TO THE DISCUSSION OF "SOCIAL SAFETY NETS" AND "TARGETING 
DISADVANTAGED GROUPS." 
 
¶10.  UNDER DISCUSSION OF COUNTRY CASE STUDIES, USDEL 
NOTED THAT THE SECRETARIAT'S PROPOSAL FOCUSED ON 
"PROGRESS MADE...FROM A POLICY, LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL 
POINT OF VIEW."  USDEL ASKED THAT THE COUNTRY CASE 
STUDIES (PROPOSED FOR BRAZIL, INDIA, MALI, NEPAL, SOUTH 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01890  02 OF 03  050507Z 
AFRICA AND UGANDA) ALSO COVER THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE 
RIGHT TO FOOD POLICY HAD ACTUALLY AFFECTED NATIONAL FOOD 
SECURITY. 
 
SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  THE BUREAU DISCUSSED THE PROPOSAL TO HAVE THE 
SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD RETURN TO ROME TO 
ADDRESS THE BUREAU.  NO BUREAU MEMBER SUPPORTED THE 
PROPOSAL.  MALI NOTED THAT THAT "THE AFRICAN GROUP WAS 
CONFUSED BY (ZIEGLER'S) PRESENTATION" AT THE IGWG. 
 
¶12. THE BUREAU CONSIDERED THE FINAL "SYNTHESIS" REPORT 
(WHICH INCLUDED SUBMISSIONS MADE AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE 
IGWG) AND WORKING DOCUMENT 2 "ISSUES OF CONVERGENCE AND 
DIVERGENCE" (WHICH ATTEMPTED TO INCORPORATE CORRECTIONS 
TO THE DOCUMENT REQUESTED DURING THE IGWG).  USDEL STATED 
THAT THE "CONVERGENCE AND DIVERGENCE" DOCUMENT STILL 
CONTAINED A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS AND NOTED THAT IT WAS AN 
INTERNAL DOCUMENT ONLY, INTENDED TO ASSIST THE BUREAU AND 
SHOULD NOT BE PRESENTED TO THE COMMITTEE ON WORLD FOOD 
SECURITY AS PART OF THE REPORT OF THE IGWG. 
 
NEXT MEETINGS 
------------- 
¶13.  THE BUREAU WILL MEET THURSDAY JUNE 12 AT 10:00 
DURING THE CFS SESSION.  THE BUREAU WILL MEET JULY 9-11, 
2003 TO CONSIDER A FIRST DRAFT OF THE GUIDELINES.

------------------------ 
¶14.  THE EUROPEAN REGIONAL GROUP HAS QUERIED THE U.S. 
AGAIN CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL TO ADD A RAPPORTEUR TO THE 
BUREAU.  USDEL HAS CONSISTENTLY RESPONDED THAT THERE IS 
NO NEED FOR A RAPPORTEUR (SEE REFTEL FOR ADDITIONAL 
DISCUSSION).  WE EXPECT THE ISSUE TO BE RAISED AGAIN AT 
THE NEXT IGWG SESSION. 
 
BUREAU SUBSTITUTION 
------------------- 
¶15.  REFTEL FAILED TO MENTION THAT THE IGWG AGREED THAT, 
IN THE EVENT THAT A BUREAU MEMBER WAS ABSENT, A 
REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE REGION COULD SUBSTITUTE HIM OR 
HER. 
 
COMMENT

¶16. USDEL AND OTHER OECD BUREAU MEMBERS WERE SURPRISED BY 
THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAO LEGAL OFFICER SUPPORTING THE 
BUREAU'S WORK ARGUED FOR BROADENING THE IGWG'S MANDATE 
BEYOND NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY INTO ALL THE ISSUES COVERED 
BY COMMENT 12 OF THE COVENANT ON ESC RIGHTS.  WE ARE
