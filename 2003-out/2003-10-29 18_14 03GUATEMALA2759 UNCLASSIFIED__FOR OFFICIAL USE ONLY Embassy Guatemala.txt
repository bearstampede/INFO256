SUBJECT: GUATEMALA ON CUBAN EMBARGO RESOLUTION AT UN 
 
REF: STATE 301451 
 
 (SBU/NF) PolCouns and PolOff discussed reftel points with 
Carla Rodriguez, Director General for Multilateral Affairs at 
the Foreign Ministry on October 28, and urged the GOG, in 
light of the recent arrests of human rights workers in Cuba, 
to reconsider its traditional vote in favor of the Cuban UN 
resolution against the embargo.  Rodriguez said that 
Guatemala's vote on this issue will not change from previous 
years, however, she agreed that it was important that the 
Castro regime not be given a "blank check" as a result of the 
vote.  Rodriguez agreed to propose to Foreign Minister 
Gutierrez that the GOG present a written explanation of vote 
addressing the deteriorated situation of human rights in Cuba.
