 ¶1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  MFA DIRECTOR FOR EU EXTERNAL RELATIONS 
MASSIMO GAIANI TOLD EMBOFFS ON APRIL 2 THAT IRAQ AND 
RESTORING INTRA-EU AND TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS WILL LIKELY BE 
THE POLITICAL PRIORITIES WHEN ITALY TAKES OVER THE EU 
PRESIDENCY JULY 1.  (SEPTEL WILL REPORT ECONOMIC (FIRST 
PILLAR) PRIORITIES.)  HE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WAS A 
GOOD CHANCE THAT THE CONVENTION/INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE 
(IGC) PROCESS WOULD NOT BE COMPLETED IN TIME TO SIGN A SECOND 
TREATY OF ROME.  THE BALKANS, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CONTROL, 
EU-RUSSIA, AND ENLARGEMENT ALL REMAIN IMPORTANT TO THE GOI, 
AND WILL BE GIVEN APPROPRIATE ATTENTION DURING ITS EU 
PRESIDENCY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (C)  IN A NOD TO THE NEW PARAMETERS DEFINING EU INTERNAL 
AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS, GAIANI SAID THAT "IRAQ IS THE 
PRIORITY" FOR THE EU NOW, AND THE SITUATION IS LIKELY TO BE 
THE SAME WHEN ITALY TAKES OVER THE PRESIDENCY FROM GREECE ON 
JULY 1.  PIECING BACK TOGETHER THE TATTERED RELATIONS AMONG 
EU MEMBERS AND BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE U.S. WILL CONSUME MOST 
POLITICAL ENERGY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. 
 
¶3.  (C)  ACCORDING TO GAIANI, THE GOI HAD ALL BUT WRITTEN OFF 
HOPES FOR A SECOND "TREATY OF ROME," AS REPORTED REFTEL.  HE 
SAID THAT THE CONVENTION PROCESS WAS NOT FOCUSED SUFFICIENTLY 
ON THE "CONSTITUTION" GIVEN CURRENT EVENTS; THERE WAS A GOOD 
CHANCE THAT CONVENTION PRESIDENT GISCARD D'ESTAING WOULD NOT 
BE ABLE TO KEEP TO HIS SCHEDULE OF A JUNE CLOSE FOR THE 
CONVENTION AND PRODUCTION OF THE FINAL DRAFT OF THE DOCUMENT. 
 IF THIS SLIPPED TO JULY OR LATER, A TREATY SIGNING CEREMONY 
DURING THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY WAS HIGHLY UNLIKELY.  COUPLE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01509  01 OF 02  090837Z 
THIS WITH THE PROPOSALS OF CERTAIN MEMBERS, SUCH AS THE UK, 
FOR A COOLING OFF PERIOD OF A NUMBER OF MONTHS BETWEEN THE 
CLOSE OF THE CONVENTION AND THE START OF THE IGC, AND "WE 
WILL BE LUCKY TO EVEN START, LET ALONE FINISH," THE IGC 
DURING THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY, LAMENTED GAIANI.  HE HOPED THE 
WAY AHEAD WOULD BE CLEARER AFTER THE EXTRAORDINARY SUMMIT IN 
ATHENS ON APRIL 16/17, TO COINCIDE WITH THE ENLARGEMENT 
TREATY SIGNING CEREMONY. 
 
¶4.  (C)  THE PRIORITIES REPORTED REFTEL ARE STILL THERE, 
GAIANI SAID, THEY WILL JUST HAVE TO TAKE THEIR PLACE IN THE 
NEW PECKING ORDER.  THE BALKANS, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CONTROL, 
EU-RUSSIA, ENLARGEMENT, ARE ALL IMPORTANT TO THE GOI, AND 
WILL BE GIVEN APPROPRIATE ATTENTION.  ITALY WAS PARTICULARLY 
CONCERNED THAT THE GRECO-ITALIAN PLAN TO RE-FOCUS EU 
ATTENTION ON BALKANS DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION REMAIN ON 
TRACK.  THE GOI WOULD DO WHAT IT COULD TO MAKE SURE IT DID. 
THE EU WILL PROMOTE THE STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION PROCESS 
(SAP) AS A "PRE-ACCESSION" MODEL TO HELP INTEGRATE SOUTHEAST 
EUROPE INTO THE EU. 
 
¶5.  (C)  OTHER POLITICAL ISSUES ON WHICH THE GOI WOULD FOCUS 
INCLUDE: 
 
- THE NEXT ROUND OF ENLARGEMENT:  ITALY WOULD MAKE CERTAIN 
THAT BULGARIA AND ROMANIA'S SUPPORT FOR THE US ON IRAQ WOULD 
NOT BE USED BY CERTAIN EU MEMBERS TO DERAIL THEIR  ACCESSION. 
 ITALY WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT TURKISH ACCESSION REMAINS ON THE 
AGENDA. 
 
- EU/RUSSIA: ITALY WOULD USE THE STILL STRONG FRIENDSHIP 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01509  01 OF 02  090837Z 
BETWEEN PUTIN AND BERLUSCONI TO MEND ANY DIFFERENCES FROM THE 
WAR, AND TO BEGIN A MORE "STRUCTURED, FORMAL" RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN MOSCOW AND BRUSSELS.  THIS WOULD INCLUDE, FOR 
EXAMPLE, FREQUENT MEETINGS BETWEEN THE COREPER AND RUSSIAN 
OFFICIALS. 
 
-  EU AND "NEIGHBORING STATES":  ITALY WILL USE ITS 
PRESIDENCY TO PROMOTE THE INTEGRATION, BUT NOT THE ACCESSION, 
OF STATES SUCH AS UKRAINE AND MOLDOVA. 
 
-  THE "MED" WOULD ALSO REMAIN A HIGH PRIORITY.  ITALY HAD 
HOPES THAT THE EURO-MED MINISTERIAL IN NAPLES IN NOVEMBER 
WOULD ACT AS A CATALYST FOR PROCESSES RANGING FROM THE MEPP 
TO MED IMMIGRATION CONTROL TO AN EU-MERCORSUR TREATY 
AGREEMENT BY EARLY 2004. 
 
¶6.  (C)  PM DIPLOMATIC ADVISOR BRUNO ARCHI CONFIRMED TO 
POLOFF AN APRIL 4 THAT THE GOI HAD ACCEPTED THAT COMPLETING 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL DRAFTING PROCESS AND IGC BEFORE THE END OF 
THE ITALIAN PRESIDENCY WAS INCREASINGLY UNLIKELY.  HE DID 
NOT, HOWEVER, DISCOUNT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE EU HEADS OF 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

GOVERNMENT RETURNING TO SIGN A SECOND TREATY OF ROME, EVEN IF 
THE PROCESS IS COMPLETED DURING THE NEXT (IRISH) PRESIDENCY

PAGE 02        ROME  01509  02 OF 02  090837Z 
AND NAMING THE TREATY, ARCHI SAID THAT THE MEMBERS WOULD 
AGREE TO RETURN TO ROME TO SIGN THE TREATY IN A SPIRIT OF 
"TRADITION AND CONTINUITY."   WE LEAVE IT TO DUBLIN AND USEU 
TO COMMENT ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH ALTRUISTIC GESTURES IN 
THE EU. 
 
¶7.  (C)  COMMENT:  THAT THE WAR HAS BLOCKED PROGRESS ON 
CONVENTION DISCUSSIONS, THEREBY JEOPARDIZING GOI PLANS FOR 
SIGNING THE "CONSTITUTION" DURING ITS PRESIDENCY AND FORCING 
IT TO ADJUST PRIORITIES, MUST BE A BLOW TO BERLUSCONI, GIVEN 
THAT HE HAS MENTIONED NUMEROUS TIMES IN PUBLIC AND OFFICIAL 
SETTINGS THAT IT WOULD BE THE CROWNING JEWEL OF THE ITALIAN 
PRESIDENCY.  HOWEVER, IT ALSO SIGNALS THAT ITALY IS READY TO 
TAKE A PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO ITS PRESIDENCY.  AS WE HAVE 
REPORTED, AND AS EXEMPLIFIED IN HIS SELF-PERCEIVED ROLE AS 
BROKER BETWEEN PUTIN AND THE WEST, BERLUSCONI LIKES NOTHING 
MORE THAN TO ACT AS A GO-BETWEEN AND DEAL MAKER.  IF HE CAN 
INDEED PULL OFF A POLITICAL REUNITING OF THE EU AND A 
RAPPROCHEMENT (PARDON THE FRENCH) BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE US, 
THE SATISFACTION MAY BE SOME COMPENSATION FOR LOSING THE 
CHANCE OF A SECOND "TREATY OF ROME."
