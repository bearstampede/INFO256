SUBJECT: CROATIA: CHANGES TO LAW ALLOW MOD APPROVAL OF 
FORCE PROTECTION MEASURES FOR USN SHIP VISITS 
 
REF: ZAGREB 284 
 
¶1.  ON FEBRUARY 6, THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT PASSED A DECISION 
TO MODIFY THE MARITIME LAW WHICH WILL GIVE THE MOD THE LEGAL 
AUTHORITY TO APPROVE FORCE-PROTECTION MEASURES FOR WARSHIPS 
ENTERING CROATIA'S INTERNAL WATERS.  THIS ISSUE WAS RAISED 
DURING U.S. - CROATIA BILATERAL DEFENSE CONSULTATIONS ON 
FEBRUARY 5 AND BY DASD MIRA RICARDEL PERSONALLY IN HER 
MEETING WITH DEFMIN ANTUNOVIC (REF). 
 
¶2.  THE NEW CHANGE TO THE MARITIME REGULATION STATES THAT 
"THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE MAY, AT THE REQUEST OF THE COMMANDER 
OF A FOREIGN WARSHIP, WITH THE ASSENT OF THE MINISTER OF 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS, THE MINISTER OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND THE 
MINISTER OF MARITIME AFFAIRS, APPROVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
ADDITIONAL MEASURES WHICH HAVE AS THEIR GOAL THE SECURITY OF 
THE FOREIGN WARSHIP." 
 
¶3.  THIS DECISION WILL GO INTO EFFECT ON FEBRUARY 15, AND 
WHILE IT WILL LIKELY PROVE CUMBERSOME TO IMPLEMENT, IT WILL 
OVERTURN PROHIBITIONS ON POST-USS COLE FORCE PROTECTION 
MEASURES WHICH HAD EFFECTIVELY HALTED USN SHIP VISITS TO 
CROATIAN PORTS.
