SUBJECT: 2002 INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL STRATEGY 
REPORT FOR JORDAN 
 
 
¶1.  EMBASSY AMMAN'S SUBMISSION FOR THE INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS 
CONTROL STRATEGY REPORT (INSCR) FOLLOWS: 
 
---------------- 
PART I:  SUMMARY 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  JORDAN REMAINS PRIMARILY A TRANSIT COUNTRY FOR ILLICIT DRUGS 
BECAUSE OF ITS GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION BETWEEN DRUG PRODUCING 
COUNTRIES TO THE NORTH AND DRUG CONSUMING COUNTRIES TO THE 
SOUTH AND WEST.   IN THE PAST JORDANIANS THEMSELVES DID NOT 
PRODUCE NOR CONSUME SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF ILLICIT DRUGS. 
HOWEVER, JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE NOTED AN INCREASE IN THE 
USE OF ILLICIT DRUGS IN JORDAN.  THE PRIMARY DRUG OF CHOICE IN 
JORDAN IS HEROIN SMUGGLED IN FROM TURKEY.  THE TARGET 
CONSUMER IS YOUNG UNIVERSITY AND HIGH SCHOOL AGED 
INDIVIDUALS.  THOUGH THE AMOUNTS BELIEVED TO BE CONSUMED ARE 
STILL RELATIVELY SMALL IN COMPARISON TO OTHER COUNTRIES, THE 
AUTHORITIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DIRECTION THIS NEW TREND 
IS TAKING AND REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE 
PROBLEM.  COOPERATION BETWEEN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, 
PARTICULARLY LEBANON AND SYRIA IS ONGOING AND GROWING. 
CONVERSELY, COOPERATION WITH ISRAEL IS DECREASING DUE TO THE 
CONTINUING HOSTILITIES IN THE WESTBANK.  JORDAN IS A PARTY TO THE 
1998 UN DRUG CONVENTION, ENFORCES STRICT ANTI-DRUG LAWS AND 
CONTINUES TO RECEIVE VARYING DEGREES OF COOPERATION FROM 
BORDERING STATES IN NARCOTICS INTERDICTION EFFORTS.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------- 
PART II:  STATUS OF COUNTRY 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3.  THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS THAT JORDAN WILL CHANGE FROM A 
NARCOTICS TRANSIT COUNTRY TO A NARCOTICS PRODUCING COUNTRY 
IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  STATISTICS PROVIDED BY THE PSD ANTI- 
NARCOTICS DEPARTMENT SEEM TO CONFIRM THIS ASSESSMENT.  JORDAN 
CONTINUES TO BE A TRANSIT COUNTRY FOR NARCOTICS, AND REMAINS 
VULNERABLE TO ILLICIT DRUG SMUGGLING THROUGH ITS VAST DESERT 
BORDERS.  JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THE INCREASE IN HEROIN 
USE AND SALES ARE DRIVEN BY YOUNG PEOPLE SUPPORTING THEIR 
HABITS AND NOT NECESSARILY A PROFIT MAKING VENTURE. 
 
¶4. AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS, JORDAN REMAINS A COUNTRY WITHOUT 
NARCOTICS RELATED MONEY LAUNDERING LAWS.  THE CENTRAL BANK 
HOWEVER, HAS INFORMED LOCAL BANKS REGARDING MONEY 
LAUNDERING SCHEMES.  LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS FEAR THE LACK 
OF SUCH LAWS WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO MORE AGGRESSIVE 
TRAFFICKING WITH POTENTIAL FOR MONEY LAUNDERING. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
PART III: COUNTRY ACTIONS AGAINST DRUGS IN 2002 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5.  POLICY INITIATIVES: 
 
IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASED USAGE OF HEROIN AMONG SCHOOL AND 
UNIVERSITY AGED INDIVIDUALS, JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE 
LAUNCHED A WIDE SPREAD AWARENESS CAMPAIGN IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
EDUCATE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE PERILS OF DRUG USE.  LAST YEAR OVER 
300 PRESENTATIONS WERE MADE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AT SCHOOLS 
AND UNIVERSITIES. 
 
¶6.  LAW ENFORCEMENT 
 
JORDAN'S PUBLIC SECURITY DIRECTORATE (PSD) MAINTAINS AN ACTIVE 
ANTI-NARCOTICS AND COUNTERFEITING BUREAU.  IN 2002 THE BUREAU 
ADDED AN ADDITIONAL 16 OFFICERS TO HELP COMBAT THE CONTINUING 
NARCOTICS TRANSIT SITUATION AND INCREASING HEROIN USAGE 
PROBLEM.  FURTHERMORE, THE PSD ARE HOPING TO HOST A REGIONAL 
ANTI-NARCOTICS TRAINING SEMINAR IN JULY OF 2003 
 
THOUGH PSD STATISTICS INDICATE A REDUCTION IN HEROIN SEIZURES 
AND AN INCREASE IN OPIUM SEIZURES, OFFICIALS ARE CLEARLY MORE 
CONCERNED WITH AN INCREASE IN HEROIN USAGE, ESPECIALLY IN THE 
MORE AFFLUENT AREA OF AQABA, RAMTHA AND WEST AMMAN. 
OFFICIALS REPORT THAT ALTHOUGH THE USAGE OF HEROIN IS STILL 
WELL BELOW THAT OF OTHER COUNTRIES, THE TREND IS OBVIOUS AND 
THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE PROBLEM.  ONE 
STATISTIC THAT APPEARS TO JUSTIFY THEIR CONCERN INDICATES THAT 
TEN YEARS AGO, NO OVERDOSE DEATHS WERE REPORTED IN JORDAN.  IN 
2002, THERE WERE MORE THAN 20 DEATHS ATTRIBUTED TO DRUG OVER 
DOSE. 
 
THE PSD MAINTAINS LIAISON CHANNELS WITH COUNTER-NARCOTICS 
OFFICERS IN LEBANON AND SYRIA TO INTERCEPT TRANSITIONAL 
SHIPMENTS OF DRUGS.  THE PSD NARCOTICS LIAISON OFFICER DETAILED 
TO THE JORDANIAN EMBASSY IN SAUDI ARABIA CONTINUES TO 
COORDINATE NARCOTICS INVESTIGATIONS WITH SAUDI COUNTER- 
NARCOTICS AUTHORITIES. 
 
¶7.  CORRUPTION: 
 
JORDANIAN OFFICIALS REPORT NO NARCOTIC RELATED CORRUPTION OR 
INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD.  THERE IS CURRENTLY NO 
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT SENIOR LEVEL OFFICIALS ARE INVOLVED IN 
NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING. 
¶8.  AGREEMENTS AND TREATIES: 
 
JORDAN REMAINS COMMITTED TO EXISTING BILATERAL AGREEMENTS 
PROVIDING FOR SOME COUNTER-NARCOTICS COOPERATION BETWEEN 
SYRIA, LEBANON, IRAQ, SAUDI ARABIA, TURKEY, EGYPT, PAKISTAN AND 
HUNGARY.  JORDAN IS A PARTY TO THE WORLD CUSTOMS 
ORGANIZATION'S INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON MUTUAL 
ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE FOR THE PREVENTION, INVESTIGATION 
AND REPRESSION OF CUSTOMS OFFENSES (NAIROBI CONVENTION), ANNEX 
X ON ASSISTANCE IN NARCOTICS CASES. 
 
¶9. CULTIVATION AND PRODUCTION: 
 
EXISTING LAWS PROHIBIT THE CULTIVATION AND OR PRODUCTION OF 
NARCOTICS IN JORDAN.  THESE LAWS HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVELY 
ENFORCED. 
 
¶10.  DRUG FLOW AND TRANSIT: 
 
JORDAN HAS BEEN AND REMAINS PRIMARILY A NARCOTICS TRANSIT 
COUNTRY.  JORDAN IS BORDERED BY NARCOTICS PRODUCING COUNTRIES 
TO THE NORTH AND NARCOTICS CONSUMING COUNTRIES TO THE SOUTH 
AND WEST.  JORDAN'S PRIMARY CHALLENGE IN STEMMING THE FLOW OF 
NARCOTICS THROUGH THE COUNTRY REMAINS THE REMOTE, LONG AND 
OPEN BORDERS WITH NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.  WHILE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS CONFIRM SUBSTANTIAL COOPERATION WITH 
IT'S NEIGHBORS, THE VAST AND DESOLATE BORDER REGIONS AND THE 
NOMADIC TRIBES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRAFFICKING OF NARCOTICS 
MAKES INTERDICTION EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.  NONE OF THE NARCOTICS 
TRANSITING JORDAN ARE BELIEVED TO BE DESTINED FOR THE UNITED 
STATES. 
 
¶11.  DOMESTIC PROGRAMS 
 
JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES ARE FOCUSED ON AWARENESS AND 
EDUCATION, INTERDICTION AND REHABILITATION.  JORDANIAN 
OFFICIALS HAVE INSTITUTED A ROBUST AWARENESS PROGRAM LARGELY 
IN RESPONSE TO THE APPARENT INCREASE IN HEROIN USE.  JORDANIAN 
AUTHORITIES ARE ALSO INCREASING REHABILITATION ABILITIES.  WITH 
UNITED NATIONS ASSISTANCE, JORDAN IS MODERNIZING ITS DRUG 
TREATMENT CENTERS TO INCLUDE PRIVATE HOSPITALS. 
 
IN 2001, THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH OPENED ITS SECOND REHABILITATION 
CENTER, THE NATIONAL REHABILITATION CENTER, IN SHAFRA BEIDA, A 
SUBURB OF AMMAN.  THE NEW FACILITY OFFERS BEDS FOR THE 
TREATMENT OF 60 ADDICTS.  FURTHERMORE, INDIVIDUALS TREATED IN 
THE FACILITIES WILL NOT BE PROSECUTED ON NARCOTICS RELATED 
CHARGES. 
 
FURTHERMORE, CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS NORMS CANNOT BE RULED 
OUT AS A FACTOR IN THE HELP TO CONTROL DRUG USE.  THE ANTI- 
NARCOTICS UNIT WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MINISTRY OF 
MUSLIM AFFAIRS AND HOLY PLACES, WHICH DIRECTS RELIGIOUS 
SPEECHES, LESSONS AND LECTURES ON AWARENESS OF DRUGS AND 
THEIR EFFECTS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
PART IV:  USG POLICY INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶12.  POLICY INITIATIVES: 
 
CREATING AN EFFECTIVE JORDANIAN INTERDICTION FORCE REMAINS A 
PRIMARY GOAL OF U.S.-JORDAN COOPERATION.  THE JORDANIAN 
GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO ITS EFFORTS TO COMBAT PRODUCTION, 
TRAFFICKING AND ABUSE OF NARCOTICS.  JORDANIAN OFFICIALS ALSO 
CONFIRM THE GOVERNMENTS COMMITMENT TOWARDS PREVENTION AND 
TREATMENT IN ORDER TO STEM THE SPREAD OF NARCOTICS IN JORDAN. 
 
¶13.  BILATERAL COOPERATION: 
 
DEA COUNTRY ATTACHI IN CYPRUS AND NARCOR HAVE A CLOSE 
WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH JORDAN AUTHORITIES ON NARCOTICS 
RELATED MATTERS.  THE UNITED STATES AND JORDAN DO NOT HAVE A 
BILATERAL NARCOTICS AGREEMENT. 
 
¶14.  THE ROAD AHEAD: 
 
EMBASSY OFFICIALS EXPECT CONTINUED COOPERATION WITH 
JORDANIAN OFFICIALS IN ANTI-NARCOTICS RELATED ISSUES. 
 
---------------------------

---------------- 
MONEY LAUNDERING 
---------------- 
 
¶14.  MONEY LAUNDERING AS RELATED TO NARCOTICS IS NOT A CRIME IN 
JORDAN.  JORDANIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS REMAIN 
SUPPORTIVE OF SUCH LEGISLATION. HOWEVER, OFFICIALS DO NOT 
BELIEVE JORDAN IS CURRENTLY A COUNTRY TARGETED BY MONEY 
LAUNDERS. 
 
¶15.  THERE ARE NO LAWS COMPELLING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO 
ADVISE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OF LARGE CURRENCY DEPOSITS 
OR OTHER SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS IN RELATION TO NARCOTICS 
CRIMES.  HOWEVER, JORDANIAN SOURCES REPORT SOME COOPERATION 
BETWEEN PROSECUTORS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CONCERNING 
REQUESTS FOR FINANCIAL DATA RELATED TO NARCOTICS CRIMES. 
JORDAN IS NOT CONSIDERED A REGIONAL FINANCIAL CENTER. 
 
---------------- 
CHEMICAL CONTROL 
---------------- 
 
¶16.  THERE IS NO CONFIRMED PRODUCTION OF PRECURSOR OR ESSENTIAL 
CHEMICALS IN JORDAN.  THERE WERE NO REPORTED SEIZURES OF 
CHEMICALS OR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN 2002.
