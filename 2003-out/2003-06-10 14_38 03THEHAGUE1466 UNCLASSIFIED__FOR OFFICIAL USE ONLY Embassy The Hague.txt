SUBJECT: DUTCH RESPONSE ON IAEA SAFEGUARDS BUDGET INCREASE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 150262 
 
(SBU) PolOff delivered reftel demarche to MFA's 
Nonproliferation Director Paul Wilke on June 5.  While the 
Dutch MFA supports the safeguards budget increase, their 
Ministry of Finance does not.  Accordingly, the GONL is not 
in a position to demarche other countries at this time.  If 
the IAEA approves the budget increase, this may improve the 
MFA's leverage with the Ministry of Finance.
