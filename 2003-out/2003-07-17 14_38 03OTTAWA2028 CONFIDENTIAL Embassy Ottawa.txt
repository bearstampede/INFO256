SUBJECT: CANADA APPRECIATES REAL STORY ON FIVE CUBAN SPIES 
 
REF: STATE 198831 
 
Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). 
 
(C) Post delivered talking points contained reftel on July 
15, 2003 to Kimberly Cowan, desk officer for Cuba in DFAIT's 
Caribbean and Central America Division. Cowan expressed 
appreciation for the information, saying she frequently 
receives inquiries from Canadians who are convinced the U.S. 
is violating the human rights of the five Cuban spies. Cowan 
said a lot of misinformation about the case has been spread 
by a pro-Castro group called the Canadian-Cuban Friendship 
Association, which refers to the prisoners as the "Miami 
Five."  This group is seeking to organize a visit to Canada 
by family members of the prisoners, in an effort to gain 
sympathy from Canadians for their situation. Comment: Should 
such a visit occur, and if it receives much attention from 
the Canadian press, post recommends press guidance be 
prepared setting out, in detail, the full due process 
provided by the American justice system in this case. End 
comment.
