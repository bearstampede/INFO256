SUBJECT: 5/14/03 IBB COURTROOM EXPLOSION: LIKELY A CRIMINAL 
ACT 
 
REF: SANAA 1105 
 
¶1. On May 15, one day after an explosion occurred in the same 
courthouse in Ibb as the recently concluded trail of the 
Jibla hospital murders, more details have emerged that point 
to this incident being a result of a tribal dispute. 
 
¶2.  Ibb PSO officer al-Kudaimi, told Consular FSN that a 
night-shift military guard allowed the perpetuators to place 
the bomb inside the appeals courtroom the night before the 
incident occurred. The next morning, the bomb went off as the 
judge entered the room, slightly injuring him.  PSO reports 
no other casualties. 
 
¶3.  Al-Kudaimi reported that nine or ten individuals 
allegedly connected to the attack were arrested and charged 
with disturbing the peace. Further charges will be added 
pending the results of a task-force investigation.  The 
murder trial that was being held in the courtroom where the 
explosion took place was originally held in Yarim, but was 
moved to Ibb for security reasons.  Al-Kudaimi stressed that 
PSO does not believe this is related to any extremist 
activity, and believes that the man's fellow tribesmen sought 
revenge for his murder conviction. 
 
¶4. Ministry of Interior officials told RSO they had no new 
information to report. 
 
¶5. Comment: As more information comes to light, the courtroom 
explosion increasly appears to be the result of a tribal 
dispute and not related to al-Qaeda or other extremist 
activity. There is no indication of a link to the recent 
conviction of the Jibla hospital murderer. End Comment.
