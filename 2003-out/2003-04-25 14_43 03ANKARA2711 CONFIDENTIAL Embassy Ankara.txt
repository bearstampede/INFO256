MFA/Disarmament Second Secretary Esra Dogan.  Dogan thanked 
us for sharing the USG approach with regard to the April 29 
"European Defense Summit," which will include France, 
Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg.  She indicated that the GOT 
shares our concern and that Ankara also does not want to see 
any summit statement that contradicts the fundamental 
principles of the Berlin-plus arrangements recently agreed 
between NATO and the EU.  Dogan asked that we share with the 
GOT the four participants' reaction to our demarche as well 
as provide Ankara with a readout of the summit's outcome and 
any follow-up USG conversations or actions on this matter.
