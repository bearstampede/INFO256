CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF ROB SILBERSTEIN, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (SBU) POST WELCOMES DEPARTMENT'S DECISION TO LAUNCH AN 
EXBS PROGRAM IN CROATIA AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT 
ON THE EXBS PROGRAM "ROAD MAP" (REF A).  THE TECHNICAL 
PROGRAMS AND TRAINING THAT COME WITH THE EXBS PROGRAM GIVE US 
ADDED LEVERAGE TO FOSTER INCREASED GOC COOPERATION ON 
REGIONAL SECURITY AND ARMS CONTROL ISSUES. 
 
THE EXBS ENVIRONMENT IN CROATIA

PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00914  01 OF 02  250603Z 
¶2. (SBU) THE ASSISTANCE ENVIRONMENT IN CROATIA IS COMPLEX AND 
HAS CHANGED MARKEDLY SINCE THE EXBS ASSESSMENT TEAM CAME TO 
ZAGREB IN MARCH 2002.  CROATIA, UNDER THE EU'S STABILIZATION 
AND ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT, HAS BEGUN TO RECEIVE MILLIONS OF 
EUROS IN ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE EU/CARDS PROGRAM. 
APPROXIMATELY EURO 14 MILLION PER YEAR FROM 2002 TO 2004 IS 
EARMARKED FOR BORDER CONTROL, POLICE AND CUSTOMS REFORM AND 
ASYLUM ISSUES.  EU MEMBER STATES ALSO PROVIDE LIMITED 
BILATERAL ASSISTANCE ON BORDER SECURITY ISSUES.  THE USG, 
THROUGH THE INL- AND SEED-FUNDED PROGRAMS PROVIDES 
APPROXIMATELY USD 1.5 MILLION PER YEAR IN ASSISTANCE FOR 
POLICE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SECTOR REFORM.  U.S. PROGRAMS ARE 
DUE TO PHASE OUT IN FY 2004.  WE RECENTLY ALSO LAUNCHED THE 
DOD-MANAGED WMD COUNTER-PROLIFERATION PROGRAM.  OUR CHALLENGE 
IS TO ENSURE THAT THE EXBS PROGRAM COMPLEMENTS AND DOES NOT 
COMPETE WITH THESE EXISTING INITIATIVES. 
 
¶3. (C) THE EU FACTOR IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT.  CROATIA'S 
PRINCIPAL FOREIGN POLICY GOAL IS EU MEMBERSHIP.  OUR 
EXPERIENCE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THAT CROATIAN POLICY-MAKERS 
WILL SHY AWAY FROM IMPLEMENTING ANY INITIATIVE SHOULD THEY 
BELIEVE THAT ITS PRESCRIPTIONS ARE IN CONFLICT WITH EU 
RECOMMENDATIONS OR PROGRAMS. 
 
¶4. (SBU) WHILE THE ASSISTANCE FIELD IS CROWDED, THE EXBS 
PROGRAM ADDRESSES A UNIQUE NEED.  THE EU'S PROGRAMS ARE 
FOCUSED ON CROATIA'S EXTENSIVE UNDER-MANNED AND 
UNDER-EQUIPPED LAND BORDER: CROATIAN PORTS AND MARITIME 
SECURITY ISSUES LARGELY HAVE BEEN IGNORED BY THE EU.  NEITHER 
DOES THE CARDS PROGRAM ENVISION INITIATIVES TO STRENGTHEN 
CROATIAN CONTROLS OVER ARMS AND DUAL USE EXPORTS.  U.S. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00914  01 OF 02  250603Z 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SECTOR ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS COULD PROVIDE A 
USEFUL LAUNCHING PAD FOR SOME EXBS INITIATIVES, BUT THEIR 
EMPHASIS LAYS ELSEWHERE. 
 
¶5. (C) DURING OUR BILATERAL DEFENSE CONSULTATIONS IN FEBRUARY 
2003, GOC REPRESENTATIVES ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE LACK OF 
INTER-AGENCY COOPERATION SERIOUSLY DEGRADED CROATIA'S ABILITY 
TO CONTROL ITS BORDERS AND TO MANAGE CRISES.  WHILE SOME 
REFORMERS IN THE GOC ARE READY TO CREATE AN INTER-AGENCY 
COMMITTEE TO COORDINATE BORDER AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT ISSUES, 
BUREAUCRATIC RESISTANCE WITHIN THE GOC HAS STYMIED THIS 
INITIATIVE TO DATE.  BY TARGETING OUR EXBS ASSISTANCE, WE 
HOPE TO ENCOURAGE THE GOC TO STAND UP SUCH A COMMITTEE IN 
ORDER TO MANAGE THE RESOURCES THAT WOULD FLOW FROM THE EXBS 
AND WMD PROGRAMS.  SUCH A SINGLE FOCAL POINT WOULD MAKE OUR 
ASSISTANCE DELIVERY MORE EFFICIENT AS WELL AS ENHANCE THE 
OVERALL BORDER SECURITY/CRISIS MANAGEMENT CAPACITY OF 
CROATIA.
