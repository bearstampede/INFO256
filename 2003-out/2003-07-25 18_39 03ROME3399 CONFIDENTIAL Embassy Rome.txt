CLASSIFIED BY: A/POL MINISTER-COUNSELOR GARY ROBBINS FOR REASONS 1.5(B) 
 AND (C) 
 
¶1.  (C) SUMMARY.  MFA DIRECTOR-GENERAL FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 
CABRAS SAID ITALY BACKS OUR CALL FOR EU SUPPORT OF AN ECOWAS 
MISSION IN LIBERIA, AND IS CIRCULATING A FUNDING REQUEST 
WITHIN THE EU.  ITALY'S EU CORRESPONDENT IS ALSO ENGAGED. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (C) A/POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR AND POLOFF MET JULY 24 
WITH CABRAS AND SEBASTIANO FULCI, MFA OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR 
WESTERN AFRICA.  CABRAS -- WHO HAD ALREADY LEARNED FROM 
ITALY'S EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON THAT THE US HAS COMMITTED AN 
INITIAL 10 MILLION USD FOR ECOWAS SUPPORT -- AGREED ON THE 
NEED FOR EU SUPPORT OF AN ECOWAS MISSION IN LIBERIA AND SAID 
ITALY WOULD LEAD AN APPEAL FOR EU FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. 
CABRAS NOTED THAT THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN A SERIES OF EU 
DISCUSSIONS ON FINANCING AN ECOWAS MISSION.  ON USE OF AN 
ECOWAS TRUST FUND, CABRAS STRESSED THE NEED FOR DONORS TO BE 
    ASSURED THAT FUNDS ARE USED APPROPRIATELY, AND SAID 
STANDARDIZED AND TRANSPARENT MECHANISMS WOULD BE NECESSARY TO 
EASE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT CORRUPTION AND TO ENCOURAGE DONORS' 
GENEROSITY. 
 
¶3.  (C) CABRAS SAID THE EU'S PRIMARY FOCUS IS STILL ON 
REACHING A PEACE AGREEMENT.  THE OUTLINES OF AN AGREEMENT ARE 
CLEAR AND ALREADY ON THE TABLE, BUT THE OPPOSING SIDES HAVE 
NOT YET REACHED CONSENSUS ON POWER SHARING AND THE 
DISTRIBUTION OF GOVERNMENT PORTFOLIOS.  THE REBELS DEMAND 
PRESIDENT TAYLOR'S REMOVAL AND SEEK THE PRESIDENCY AND THE 
VICE-PRESIDENCY, WHILE THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IS HOPING TO 
RETAIN THE PRESIDENCY AND SOME LEGITIMACY AS A 
DEMOCRATICALLY-ELECTED GOVERNMENT. 
 
¶4. (C) WE ALSO BRIEFED ITALY'S EU CORRESPONDENT, WHO 
CONFIRMED LATE ON 7/25 THAT ALL APPROPRIATE ELEMENTS IN 
BRUSSELS ARE ENGAGED.
