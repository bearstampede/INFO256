SUBJECT: UAE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGES 
REALITIES OF WORKERS RIGHTS 
 
¶1. (U) In a newspaper interview with a local English 
daily, the UAE Labor Undersecretary Dr. Khalid Al- 
Khazraji declared, in response to a question about the 
legality of strikes in the UAE, "The UAE labour law 
has not forbidden strikes.  It has not mentioned them 
as it has a system for labourers to get their rights 
without the need for them to organise strikes. 
Labourers have rights and if they are denied them, 
they can stop working."  Al-Khazraji also stated in 
the interview, "Regarding accusing the UAE authorities 
of not offering enough protection to labourers in the 
country, I think it is baseless and the ministry has 
never ignored complaints by workers against their 
employees.  We follow the legal procedure as specified 
by the law, we try to settle the dispute before 
referring it to the court and finally ask the two 
parties to go to the court if we fail to resolve the 
issue." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: Dr. Al-Khazraji is the public face 
of labor reform in the UAE -- he is quoted on an 
almost daily basis in the newspapers expounding upon 
Ministry initiatives.  His high profile is indicative 
not only of his prominence in the UAE bureaucracy but 
it is also a testament to his abilities.  Al-Khazraji 
is well-known to the Embassy and highly regarded for 
his intelligence and understanding of the complexities 
of the labor issues in the UAE.  Though Al-Khazraji's 
statements are predictable -- a bureaucrat would never 
state publicly that the government was not doing all 
it could as efficiently as possible -- they are 
nevertheless an accurate acknowledgement by an 
important Labor official of the reality on the ground. 
Workers do go on strike, and there are significant 
formal and informal dispute resolution mechanisms 
available to laborers. End comment.
