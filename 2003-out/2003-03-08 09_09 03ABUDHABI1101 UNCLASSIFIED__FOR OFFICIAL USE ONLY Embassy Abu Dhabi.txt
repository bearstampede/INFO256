SUBJECT: UAE PREPARES FOR IMPACT OF WAR ON STOCK MARKET 
 
¶1. (U) Local press reported on March 3 that the General 
Manager of the Stock and Commodity Authority -- the UAE 
equivalent of the SEC -- Abdullah Al Turifi, told UAE 
financial institutions that he expects the possible war with 
Iraq to have long-term impact on UAE stock markets. 
Nevertheless, the Stock and Commodity Authority will reduce 
expected market volatility by putting stronger curbs in 
place to prevent equity values from dropping too 
precipitously.  (Note:  Current curbs are 10% movement per 
day.  End note.)  Al Turifi also conceded that the market is 
currently moribund as traders have postponed purchases until 
after the war starts, since they expect stock prices to 
tumble once it begins. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  While some in the UAE anticipate business 
opportunities as a result of the Iraq crisis, the local 
stock market regulatory authority is clearly taking no 
chances, acting now to prevent potential market 
destabilization in the event of a conflict.
