E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/05/2013 
TAGS: EAIR ASEC KU
SUBJECT: KUWAITI REQUEST FOR AIR MARSHALS 
 
REF: A. KUWAIT 480 
     Â¶B. 02 STATE 78755 
 
Classified By: DCM Frank Urbancic for reason 1.5 (B) 
 
1.(U) This is an action request -- see para 5. 
 
2.(C) Per ref (A), RSO and EconChief met on February 16 with 
the head of Kuwait's Aircraft Security division of the 
Ministry of Interior, who reiterated the urgency Kuwait felt 
to quickly deploy air marshals aboard all Kuwait Airways 
flights give current regional tensions.  RSO and EconChief 
explained, drawing on guidance in ref (B), the detailed 
information required to get the deployment of air marshals 
approved by TSA in Washington. 
 
3.(C) As a result of the meeting, post received a diplomatic 
note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally requesting 
permission to deploy air marshals on Kuwait Airways flights 
to the U.S. and: 
 
-- certifying that all members of the air marshal program are 
duly trained and authorized law enforcement officers 
 
-- noting that the purpose of the air marshal program is to 
protect Kuwait Airways from terrorist attacks or any actions 
to harm the aircraft or its passengers 
 
-- explaining that each flight would be accompanied by 
between three and six air marshals 
 
-- noting that Kuwait Airways operates five flights a week to 
the United States (three to New York and two to Chicago) 
 
-- explaining that the 9mm Browning pistols used by the air 
marshals would be transferred aboard the plane between teams 
after passengers had left the plane (i.e. weapons would 
remain on board) 
 
4.(C) Post notes that RSO and EconOff were told each weapon 
would carry two magazines of ammunition with 14 rounds in 
each magazine. 
 
5.(C) ACTION REQUEST:  The GOK continues to stick its neck 
out for the U.S. in the effort to oust Saddam Hussein, and 
they feel quite vulnerable and exposed.  Having been a victim 
of air terror in the past, Kuwait intends to do all it can to 
avert such disasters now.  Post requests that TSA review and 
approve this request as soon as possible so that A-2 visas 
can be issued expeditiously and Kuwaiti air marshal 
operations can begin.  Post further requests that a regional 
TSA representative travel to Kuwait soon to finalize any 
 
SIPDIS 
necessary operational details and demonstrate our commitment 
to the security of Kuwait Airways flights.
