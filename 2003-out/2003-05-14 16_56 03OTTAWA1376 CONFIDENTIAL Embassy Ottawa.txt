¶1. (C) Don Sinclair, Director General of DFAIT,s Middle East 
and North Africa Bureau, gave us a heads-up on May 14 that 
the government of Canada will announce shortly an additional 
contribution of C$200 million (approximately U.S.$140 
million) for humanitarian relief needs and reconstruction in 
Iraq.  This contribution is on top of Canada,s previously 
announced Iraq contributions in the amount of C$100 million 
(see reftels), bringing the total amount earmarked by Canada 
for Iraq assistance this year to C$300 million (approximately 
U.S. $210 million). A public announcement of this 
contribution will be made after final approval by the Prime 
Minister, and could come as early as this afternoon. Post 
will provide additional details on the allocation of this 
contribution when they are released.
