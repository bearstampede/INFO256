SUBJECT: UAEG RECEIVES DEMARCHES ON CUSTOMS CLASSIFICATION 
OF FANTA BEVERAGE AND SAUCES 
 
REFS: A) STATE 111059 B) STATE 111099 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Acting DCM Thomas Williams for 
reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (C) Econoff delivered ref demarches 5/17 to Emirates 
Authority for Standardization and Metrology Deputy Director 
General Dr. Rashid bin Farhad regarding the U.S. position 
on the classification of Fanta beverage and certain sauces 
under the Harmonized System.  Dr. Rashid undertook to pass 
the backgrounders to his superiors, but said that -- due to 
the small volume of Fanta beverage and certain sauces 
imported into the UAE -- the reclassification of such 
products would have a minimal impact on local trade.  We 
will pass to Washington agencies any further communication 
we receive from the UAEG regarding this matter.
