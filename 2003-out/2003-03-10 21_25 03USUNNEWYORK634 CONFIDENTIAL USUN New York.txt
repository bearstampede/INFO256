SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ:TEXT OF UNDECIDED SIX "COMPROMISE PROPOSAL" 
 
REF: USUN 621 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT, 
REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
¶1. (C) IN A DISPLAY OF THE INCREASING DISCOMFORT WITH THE 
DECISION BEFORE THE COUNCIL ON IRAQ, THE UNDECIDED SIX (U-6) 
HAVE PREPARED A "COMPROMISE PROPOSAL" WHICH THEY PLAN TO PUT 
BEFORE THE COUNCIL.  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHEN THIS DRAFT (TEXT AT 
PARA 2), WHICH WAS PROVIDED BY A FRIENDLY U-6 MEMBER, WILL BE 
INTRODUCED.  ALONG WITH THIS DRAFT, THE U-6 IS ALSO 
CONSIDERING OTHER IDEAS BORNE OF DESPERATION, SUCH AS HAVING 
THE VOTING ORDER IN THE COUNCIL REVISED TO ALLOW THE "NO'S" 
TO VOTE FIRST. 
 
¶2. (C) HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DRAFT INCLUDE: THE PRESENTATION OF A 
WORK PROGRAM, DIVIDED INTO TWO PHASES, NO LATER THAN MARCH 
¶17. THIS IDEA, INTRODUCED IN OP2, INCLUDES ARTICULATING KEY 
REMAINING DISARMAMENT TASKS (KRDTS) IN THE FIRST PHASE. OP3 
REQUESTS BIWEEKLY REPORTS VIA THE COLLEGE OF COMMISSIONERS. 
OP4 SETS A "FINAL REPORT" DATE OF APRIL 17, APPARENTLY 
CONTAINING KRDTS FROM PHASE I OF THE WORK PROGRAM, AT WHICH 
POINT THE COUNCIL WOULD INITIATE PHASE II OF THE WORK 
PROGRAM, WHICH WOULD APPARENTLY CONTAIN ADDITIONAL KRDTS. OP4 
ALSO HAS A HIDDEN TRIGGER AT THE END IN THAT THE COUNCIL CAN 
DECIDE ON APRIL 17 THAT IRAQ HAS FAILED TO TAKE ITS FINAL 
OPPORTUNITY. OP6 CONTAINS AN OFFER OF FULL AMNESTY FOR 
COOPERATIVE IRAQI OFFICIALS, AN IDEA TAKEN FROM AN EARLIER 
PAKISTANI RESOLUTION. 
 
¶2. (C)BEGIN TEXT OF U-6 "COMPROMISE PROPOSAL" OPERATIVE 
PARAGRAPHS ONLY. 
 
(THE SECURITY COUNCIL) ACTING UNDER CHAPTER VII OF THE 
CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS, 
 
¶1. REAFFIRMS THE NEED FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOLUTION 
1441; 
 
¶2. DECIDES THAT UNMOVIC AND THE IAEA, NOT LATER THAN 17 MARCH 
WILL EACH SUBMIT, FOR APPROVAL BY THE COUNCIL, A WORK PROGRAM 
FOR THE DISCHARGE OF THEIR MANDATES AS REQUESTED BY 
RESOLUTION 1284, WHICH WILL BE DIVIDED IN TWO PHASES TO 
INCLUDE IN THE FIRST PHASE CLEARLY DEFINED AND PRECISE KEY 
DISARMAMENT TASKS THAT IRAQ SHOULD COMPLETE NO LATER THAN 
APRIL 17; 
 
¶3. REQUESTS THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF UNMOVIC AND IAEA TO 
PRESENT BI-WEEKLY REPORTS, THROUGH THE SECRETARY-GENERAL, TO 
THE COUNCIL, FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH THE COMMISSIONERS, 
ON THE WORK OF UNMOVIC, AS WELL AS ON THE COOPERATION AND 
COMPLIANCE BY IRAQ OF THE TASKS INCLUDED IN PHASE ONE OF THE 
WORK PROGRAM; 
 
¶4. REQUESTS ALSO THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF UNMOVIC AND IAEA 
TO PRESENT A FINAL REPORT ON THE FIRST PHASE OF THE WORK 
PROGRAM BY APRIL 17 ON THE BASIS OF WHICH THE COUNCIL WILL 
DECIDE TO INITIATE PHASE TWO OF THE WORK PROGRAM CONTAINING 
THE ADDITIONAL KEY DISARMAMENT TASKS THAT IRAQ SHOULD COMPLY 
OR THE COUNCIL WILL DECIDE THAT IRAQ HAS FAILED TO TAKE THE 
FINAL OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED BY RESOLUTION 1441; 
 
¶5. CALLS UPON IRAQ TO FULFILL THE OUTSTANDING DISARMAMENT 
TASKS AS IDENTIFIED IN PHASE ONE OF THE WORK PROGRAM AND ITS 
OTHER OBLIGATIONS UNDER UNSC RESOLUTIONS AND TO EXTEND, 
IMMEDIATE, FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL COOPERATION TO THE UN 
INSPECTORS TO SECURE THE OBJECTIVE OF DISARMAMENT OF ITS WMD 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNSC RESOLUTION 1441; 
 
¶6. DECLARES A FULL AMNESTY FOR ALL IRAQI OFFICIALS WHO EXTEND 
THEIR FULL AND UNEQUIVOCAL COOPERATION TO UNMOVIC AND IAEA 
AND OTHER UN AGENCIES AND TO THE UNSC TO SECURE FULL AND 
FAITHFUL COMPLIANCE BY IRAQ WITH THE ABOVE MENTIONED 
OBLIGATIONS AND ASSURES THEM OF PROTECTION AND SECURITY FOR 
THE PERSON AND THEIR FAMILIES; 
 
¶7. DECIDES TO REMAIN SEIZED OF THE MATTER.
