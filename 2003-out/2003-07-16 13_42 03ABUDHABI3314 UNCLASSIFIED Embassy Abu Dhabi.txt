E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL TC
SUBJECT:  UAE WOMEN'S CONFERENCE 
 
 
¶1. Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, the President of the UAE 
General Women's Union and the wife of the President of the 
UAE, has invited National Security Advisor Dr. Condoleezza 
Rice and NEA Deputy Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Cheney to 
attend the "First Economic Businesswomen Forum" in Abu 
Dhabi scheduled for October 7 to October 10, 2003.  The 
forum is cosponsored by the Arab League Council for Arab 
Business Women, the General Women's Union, and the Abu 
Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The topic of the 
forum is "Projects for Businesswomen: Reality and 
Ambitions," and it is designed to encourage further 
participation by Arab women in the economies of their 
respective countries. 
 
¶2. We understand that this forum replaces a long planned 
conference, scheduled for October 5-6, hosted by the Abu 
Dhabi World Trade Center and the Abu Dhabi Businesswomen's 
Council, on "Arab Women in the 21st Century: First Economic 
and Political Conference." The organizers have told Post 
that, given the conflicting time schedule between the two 
conferences, they have cancelled the October 5-6 
conference. 
 
¶3. According to the preliminary schedule provided by the 
Women's Union, the conference will begin with a reception 
followed by a dinner on October 6.  Work sessions are 
scheduled for October 7 and 8 covering issues relating to 
investment and women in business.  A trip to UAE President 
Sheikh Zayed's nature reserve Sir Bani Yas Island is 
scheduled for October 9.  A trip to Dubai - with shopping 
and dinner - is scheduled for October 10. 
 
¶4. Post will pouch letters of invitation and a copy of the 
schedule to the Department.  It is possible that some 
details may change.  The Ambassador will engage with the 
conference arrangers in the next week in order to obtain 
more details.  A copy of the preliminary schedule will be 
faxed to NEA/ARP.
