¶1.  (SBU) A/DCM and poloff delivered the text of the December 
21 Homeland Security Department announcement to Americas 
Department Deputy Director General Suna Ilicak on December 
¶22.  Poloff informed Ilicak that the change was in response 
to intelligence indicating the possibility of an attack 
inside the U.S. during the holiday period, but did not 
preclude the possibility of attacks against U.S. interests 
overseas. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ilicak noted our demarche and said she would convey 
this message as well to MFA Deputy Director General for 
Counterterrorism Aysa.  Ilicak asked if, as part of this 
announcement, we had any additional specific information 
about planned attacks against U.S. interests in Turkey.  We 
said we did not, but would immediately communicate any such 
information to the GOT if there were any.
