SUBJECT: GUATEMALA DEMARCHED ON TOBACCO CONTROL CONVENTION 
 
REF: STATE 106632 
 
Â¶1.  PolOff discussed reftel points and left non-paper with 
Sylvia Corado, Director for Multilateral Affairs at the 
Foreign Ministry on May 5, 2003.  Corado expressed 
appreciation for the Spanish language version of the 
non-paper, saying it would help her prod the Health Ministry. 
 Corado said it was unclear, even at this late date, if the 
Health Ministry would send representatives to the May 19 - 28 
World Health Organization Assembly in Geneva due to budget 
problems.  She said the GOG understood the U.S. need to be 
able to ratify the convention with reservations, but was 
noncommittal as to whether Guatemala would support efforts to 
delete Article 30 (prohibiting reservations).
