Classified By: CDA ROBERT K. BOGGS.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶1. (C) Charge delivered Ref A demarche to Foreign Secretary 
Madhu Raman Acharya on May 30.  Acharya denied that there has 
been any change in Government of Nepal (GON) policy toward 
Tibetans transiting Nepal.  He said that he would look into 
reports of Chinese diplomats attempting to pressure 
immigration authorities and accosting UNHCR personnel (Ref 
B).  Charge consulted with EU colleagues, who demarched the 
Foreign Ministry in parallel, emphasizing the real 
possibility of economic boycott by Europeans if Nepal deports 
the Tibetans.  The Cabinet reshuffle that began on May 30 
(Ref D) thwarted our repeated attempts to engage with 
high-ranking officials at the Ministry of Home, who claimed 
to remain closeted in meetings throughout the day. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Office of Tibet Representative Wangchuk Tsering told 
poloff that the Tibetan detainees were moved from the Dili 
Bazaar jail to the Hanuman Dhoka holding facility in downtown 
Kathmandu.  Tsering said that the move indicates that the GON 
is preparing either to deport the Tibetans or to hand them 
over to UNHCR.  As of COB May 30, police at Hanuman Dhoka 
were telling the Office of Tibet that they were awaiting 
further instructions regarding the Tibetans.  Tsering 
reported that unlike the previous day, no Chinese diplomats 
were observed by his staff in the area where the Tibetans 
were being held until after COB May 30.  He expressed hope 
that no definitive action would be taken regarding the 
detainees until after the shape of a new Cabinet (Ref D) 
becomes clearer.  UNHCR Protection Officer Giulia Ranawat 
advised that her office was able to interview just one of the 
18 detainees for the first time on May 29.  She added that 
the Department of Immigration had requested her again on May 
30 to hand over the three children previously released to 
UNHCR. 
¶3.  (C)  Comment:  The possibility remains that GON 
authorities may take advantage of the weekend hiatus to 
deport the Tibetans.  Given the uncertain make-up of a new 
Cabinet--and the distinct possibility that a different Home 
Minister may be named within a week--we doubt the typically 
cautious line officers at the Ministry would take such an 
initiative.  That said, we will continue to monitor the 
situation throughout the weekend.
