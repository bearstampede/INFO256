¶I. Summary 
Mozambique is a transit country for illegal drugs (hashish, 
herbal cannabis, cocaine, mandrax (methaqualone), and 
heroin) consumed in Europe and South Africa. Some hashish 
shipments passing through Mozambique find their way to the 
United States and Canada. The country's porous borders, 
poorly policed seacoast, and inadequately trained and 
equipped law enforcement agencies facilitate transshipment 
of narcotics to South Africa. Drug production is limited to 
herbal cannabis cultivation and mandrax laboratories. 
Available evidence suggests significant use of herbal 
cannabis and limited consumption of "club drugs"(Ecstasy, 
etc.), prescription medicines, and heroin among the urban 
elite. The Mozambican government recognizes drug use and 
drug trafficking as serious problems, but has limited 
resources to address these issues. Cooperation programs with 
the UNODC and bilateral donors have attempted to improve 
training of drug control officials and provide better 
interdiction and laboratory equipment. Corruption in the 
police and judiciary significantly hampers counternarcotics 
efforts. Mozambique is a party to the 1998 UN Drug 
Convention. 
 
II. Status of Country 
Mozambique is not a significant producer of illegal drugs. 
Herbal cannabis for local consumption is produced throughout 
the country, particularly in Tete, Nampula, and Cabo Delgado 
provinces. Limited amounts are exported to neighboring 
countries, particularly South Africa. Some factories 
producing mandrax for the South African market were raided 
and closed down in 1995, 2000 and 2002. Mozambique's role 
has grown rapidly as a drug-transit country. Southwest Asian 
producers ship cannabis resin (hashish) and synthetic drugs 
through Mozambique to Europe and South Africa. Limited 
quantities of these shipments may also reach the United 
States and Canada. Reports from the Mozambican Office for 
the Prevention and Fight Against Drugs (GCPCD) indicate that 
heroin and other opiate derivatives shipped through 
Mozambique originate in Southeast Asia. Increasing amounts 
of cocaine from Colombia and Brazil transit Portugal and 
Angola or Mozambique (all Portuguese speaking countries) on 
their way to South Africa. International flights from Lisbon 
to Maputo and from Dar es Salaam to Pemba provide a conduit 
for smuggling into South Africa. With the assistance of the 
South African police, numerous arrests were made in 2003 of 
drug couriers originating in Brazil, who transit Mozambique 
from Portugal on route to Johannesburg or continue through 
Johannesburg to Maputo to take advantage of the relatively 
lax controls disembarking in Maputo. Mozambique is not a 
producer of precursor chemicals. 
 
III. Country Actions Against Drugs in 2003 
Accomplishments. Mozambique's accomplishments in meeting its 
goals under the 1988 UN Drug Convention remain limited. 
Government resources devoted to the counternarcotics effort 
are meager, and only limited donor funds are available. 
Mozambique is cooperating with the UNODC through two 
assistance projects designed to increase law enforcement 
capacity and border control. Local law enforcement agents in 
some provinces have destroyed cannabis crops. In 1995, 2000, 
and 2002, Mozambique cooperated with South Africa in raiding 
Mandrax factories near Maputo. Mozambican officials also 
seized assets connected with the production of mandrax, but 
not assets related to profits derived from drug sales. The 
Mozambican government carries out drug education programs in 
local schools in cooperation with bilateral and multilateral 
donors as part of its demand reduction efforts. 
Law Enforcement Efforts. Mozambique's drug unit, which 
operates in Maputo and reports to the Chief of the Criminal 
Investigation Police, received refresher training in drug 
interdiction techniques as part of a UNODC program in 2001 
and 2002. Under this program, 20 officers were hired and 
trained to staff drug units. Drug detection equipment was 
installed at border posts, ports, and airports. Customs 
officers at Maputo airport and seaport have received drug 
interdiction training under a UNODC program. The UNODC is 
working with customs agents at land borders as part of a 
program with Mozambique, South Africa, and Swaziland. 
Publicized seizures in 2003 include: 
- The seizure of heroin being smuggled from Brazil via 
Lisbon by two couriers at Maputo Mavalane International 
Airport in October and November and the arrest in South 
Africa in December of a Tanzanian national identified by the 
couriers. 
- The seizure by customs officials of 9.3 kilos of cocaine 
found in the baggage of a passenger arriving at Mavalane 
Airport in December. 
- The detention of three senior police officers in 
Inhambane province for trafficking in hashish and marijuana 
in November 2003. The drugs were seized from a Pakistani 
national in 2001. 
- The seizure of 75 kilos of a chemical used in the 
manufacture of mandrax found in a parked car on a busy 
street in Maputo in November. 
- The arrest of a Tanzanian national in May at Mavalane 
Airport smuggling 2 kilograms of cocaine in his stomach. 
Mozambique has not received requests for the extradition of 
drug-related suspects. 
Corruption. Corruption is pervasive in Mozambique. 
Mozambique has not prosecuted government officials for 
corruption relating to the production, processing, or 
shipment of narcotic and psychotropic drugs or controlled 
substances, nor has it prosecuted any individual for 
discouraging the investigation or prosecution of such acts. 
Agreements and Treaties. Mozambique is a party to the 1988 
UN Drug Convention, the 1961 UN Single Convention on 
Narcotic Drugs, as amended by the 1972 Protocol, and the 
1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Mozambique 
has signed, but has not yet ratified, the UN Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime. 
Cultivation/Production. Cannabis is cultivated in Nampula, 
Zambezia, Niassa, Cabo Delgado, Tete, Manica, and Sofala 
provinces. The Mozambican government has no estimates on 
crop size. Intercropping is reportedly common. 
Drug Flow/Transit. Assessments of drugs transiting 
Mozambique are based upon limited seizure data and 
observations of local and UNODC officials. Mozambique 
increasingly serves as a transit country for hashish, 
cannabis resin, heroin, and Mandrax originating in Southwest 
Asia, owing to its vast, unpatrolled coastline, lack of 
resources for interdiction and sea, air, and land borders, 
and growing transportation links with neighboring countries. 
Drugs destined for the South African and European markets 
arrive in Mozambique by small ship, especially in the 
coastal areas of the northern provinces, including islands 
off Cabo Delgado and Nampula. The Maputo corridor border 
crossing at Ressano Garcia/Lebombo is an important transit 
point. Hashish and heroin are also shipped on to Europe, and 
there is evidence that some hashish may reach Canada and the 
United States, but not in significant quantities. Arrests in 
Brazil, Mozambique and South Africa indicate cocaine is 
being shipped by drug couriers from Colombia and Brazil to 
Mozambique through Lisbon for onward shipment to South 
Africa and East Asia. In addition, there is anecdotal 
evidence that Nigerian and Tanzanian cocaine traffickers 
have targeted Mozambique as a gateway to the South African 
and European markets. 
Domestic Programs (Demand Reduction). The primary drugs of 
abuse are alcohol and herbal cannabis. Heroin, cocaine, and 
"club drug" usage and prescription drug abuse are also 
reported among Mozambique's urban elite. The GCPCD has 
developed a drug education program for use in schools. It 
has provided the material to a number of local NGOs for use 
in their drug education programs. The Maputo GCPCD office 
conducted an education program aimed at youth in 2001. The 
program included plays and lectures in schools, churches, 
and other places where youth gather. The Sofala provincial 
GCPCD office has created a community volunteer educational 
program. Funds were not available in 2003 for continuation 
of these education programs beyond major cities. Drug abuse 
and treatment options are scarce. The GCPCD is seeking donor 
assistance in creating three regional treatment centers in 
Maputo, Beira, and Nampula. 
 
IV. U.S. Policy Initiatives and Programs 
THE USG SENDS MOZAMBICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND 
PROSECUTORS TO REGIONAL TRAINING PROGRAMS THROUGH THE 
INTERNATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACADEMY (ILEA) FOR AFRICA IN 
BOTSWANA. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO RECEIVED 
TRAINING AT ILEA NEW MEXICO. 
THE BUREAU FOR INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AFFAIRS PROVIDED SUPPORT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ANTI- 
CORRUPTION UNIT AND THE POLICE SCIENCES ACADEMY (ACIPOL). 
THE FUNDS PROVIDE FOR TRAINING, SPECIALIZED COURSE 
INSTRUCTION, INSTRUCTOR DEVELOPMENT, AND CURRICULUM 
DEVELOPMENT FOR ACIPOL. THE ANTI-CORRUPTION UNIT, WHICH 
BEGAN OPERATIONS IN NOVEMBER 2002, HAS RECEIVED SPECIALIZED 
TRAINING AND ADVISOR VISITS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE OPDAT PROGRAM, AS WELL AS RENOVATION OF THEIR OFFICE 
FACILITY, IT EQUIPMENT, AND OFFICE FURNITURE, FUNDED BY AID. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ICITAP PROGRAM PROVIDES A MEDIUM- 
TERM ADVISOR TO ACIPOL TO COORDINATE THESE ACTIVITIES. 
The Department of Defense has assisted the Mozambican navy 
to develop a plan for improved coastal surveillance 
activities, and is providing training to Mozambican military 
personnel. However, the USG cannot provide the Mozambican 
navy with resources for coastal patrol capacity until the 
Mozambican parliament establishes a codified system of 
maritime law.
