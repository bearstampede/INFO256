FROM AMBASSADOR TO HR/OE DOUG FRANK; NEA/SA/EX BILL 
HUDSON 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: APER AFIN AMGT
SUBJECT: URGENT NEED FOR FSN HEALTH INSURANCE, UAE 
 
 
THE LEVEL OF HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE UAE 
GOVERNMENT TO THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS (WHO COMPRISE 100 
PERCENT OF OUR FSN STAFF) HAS DIMINISHED SO RAPIDLY IN 
THE PAST MONTHS THAT THE NEED FOR A HEALTH INSURANCE 
PROGRAM FOR OUR STAFF HAS NOW BECOME URGENT. 
 
CALLS TO THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH) REVEAL THAT NOT 
EVEN THE MINISTER'S PERSONAL AIDE CAN EXPLAIN EXACTLY 
WHAT BENEFITS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE HEALTH CARD. 
ONE EMPLOYEE IS CHARGED AED 20 FOR TWO INOCULATIONS AND 
A CONSULTATION.  ANOTHER IS CHARGED AED 200 TO SET A 
BROKEN ARM.  ANOTHER IS CHARGED FULL COST FOR AN MRI AND 
A CAT SCAN (RUNNING INTO THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS). 
LINES AT THE ONLY HOSPITALS APPROVED FOR USE WITH THE 
CARD ARE NOTORIOUS; THE WAIT IS USUALLY SEVERAL HOURS. 
EMPLOYEES WAIT TWO MONTHS FOR ROUTINE EXAMINATIONS AND 
NOT-SO-ROUTINE CHECKS. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME FOR EXPATRIATES 
IS IN CHAOS.  WE SEE PRESS PIECES THAT THE MINISTRY OF 
LABOR PLANS TO IMPLEMENT MANDATORY PRIVATE INSURANCE FOR 
ALL EXPATRIATES BY MAKING ISSUANCE OF A LABOR PERMIT 
CONTINGENT ON PROOF OF SUCH.  BUT WE DO NOT EXPECT RAPID 
PROGRESS, BECAUSE OF  THE POLITICAL IMPOSSIBILITY OF 
IMPOSING PRIVATE INSURANCE ON ALL COMPANIES.  THE VAST 
MAJORITY OF THE UAE LABOR FORCE IS EXPATRIATE. 
 
THE ONLY CLEAR TREND IS THE RAPID UNDERMINING OF THE 
BENEFITS OFFERED BY THE UAE GOVERNMENT.  POST EXPECTS TO 
SUBMIT THE UPDATED INSURANCE COMPANY SURVEY (THREE 
COMPANIES) IN TWO WEEKS.  I WOULD APPRECIATE A 
COMMITMENT BY HR/OE AND NEA/SA/EX TO MOVE FORWARD 
RAPIDLY ON THIS ISSUE. 
 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND BEST REGARDS.
