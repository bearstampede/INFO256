SUBJECT:  UAEG TO TRANSFER FROZEN ASSETS TO THE DEVELOPMENT

REF: ABU DHABI 3476 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Charge D'Affaires Richard A. Albright 
for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (U) This is an action request; please see paragraph 5. 
 
¶3.  (C) The UAE Central Bank forwarded a copy to Post of a 
July 26 letter responding to Treasury Secretary Snow's 
written request for the UAEG to transfer any frozen assets 
in the UAE belonging to the former Iraqi regime to the 
Development Fund for Iraq (reftel).  The letter states that 
a Central Bank investigation of all UAE bank accounts at 
the end of March found two accounts belonging to Iraqi 
Airways -- the balance of which (AED 305,153.16 or USD 
$83,148) has been frozen since 1990.  The Central Bank 
intends to transfer immediately this amount to the 
Development Fund for Iraq. 
 
¶4.  (C) The Central Bank letter explains that there are no 
other bank accounts within the UAE banking system that are 
clearly linked to the former Iraqi regime.  The letter 
requests, however, further clarification of the USG 
directive to confiscate and transfer to the Development 
Fund for Iraq accounts related to "individuals and entities 
that may have acted on behalf of the former Iraqi regime 
and its senior officials." 
 
¶5.  (C) Comment and action request:  As usual, we have 
received exemplary cooperation from the UAE banking 
authorities, and the letter suggests that the Central Bank 
would likely confiscate and transfer additional funds if 
the USG could provide a list of individuals and entities 
and specific and clear evidence of their relationship to 
the former Iraqi regime.  Post would appreciate any 
guidance and specific information that Washington agencies 
can provide to help the UAEG identify such accounts.  End 
comment and action request.
