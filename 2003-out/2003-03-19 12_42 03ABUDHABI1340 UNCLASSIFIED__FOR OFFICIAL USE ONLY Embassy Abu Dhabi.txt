SUBJECT:  STRATEGIC DIALOGUE FOLLOW-UP: OPIC COVERAGE 
 
REF: A) ABU DHABI 941, B) ABU DHABI 1090 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a meeting with Finance Minstate Dr. 
Muhammad Khalfan bin Khirbash (the de facto Finance 
Minister) on March 18, the Ambassador followed-up on 
the issue of OPIC coverage for the UAE, first raised 
by the UAEG last Fall in the context of the bilateral 
Strategic Dialogue meetings in Washington.  The 
Ambassador noted that a number of U.S. companies have 
expressed interest in seeing OPIC coverage extended to 
the UAE.  Dr. Khirbash said the UAEG is still very 
interested in securing OPIC coverage, particularly as 
it might help attract additional U.S. foreign direct 
investment (FDI). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Ambassador said the Labor Ministry's 
recent drafting of a proposal to more formally 
recognize workers rights (see reftels) is a positive 
development.  Having these draft rules promulgated 
might prove helpful in making the argument for a 
return of OPIC coverage.  Dr. Khirbash agreed and said 
he would contact the Labor Minister and push for rapid 
approval of the proposed regulations. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Comment:  Having Dr. Khirbash weigh in may 
help speed up the usually rather lengthy approval 
process for regulations.
