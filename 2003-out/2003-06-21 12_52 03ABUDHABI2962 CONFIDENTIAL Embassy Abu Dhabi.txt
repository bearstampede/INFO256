SUBJECT:  U/S BOLTON ENCOURAGES EARLY SIGNING OF AN 
ICC ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) In the course of a June 18 meeting in Abu 
Dhabi with MFA Minister of State Shaykh Hamdan bin 
Zayid Al-Nahyan, Under Secretary for Under 
Secretary for Arms Control and International 
 
SIPDIS 
Security Assistance John R. Bolton urged the UAE to 
conclude a bilateral ICC Article 98 agreement (see 
septel for other topics).  U/S Bolton provided an 
overview of USG progress made towards signing ICC 
Article 98 agreements, 45 of which have been 
concluded.  U/S Bolton had signed the most recent 
one that morning with Kuwait.  He laid out the 
President's desire to see more agreements 
concluded, including one with the UAE, particularly 
in light of the potential for the unfair targeting 
of Americans and the fact that the ICC has recently 
begun operations.  Bolton noted the ridiculous 
cases brought in Belgium against former President 
Bush, Secretary Powell and General Franks. 
 
¶3. (C) Shaykh Hamdan affirmed the UAE's desire for 
an agreement and pledged his personal involvement 
in signing one as soon as possible.  Hamdan said 
the U.S. had done the world a huge favor in 
removing Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq and was 
pursuing a similarly just policy in North Korea and 
Iran.  In Hamdan's view, the U.S. "deserves our 
support" and the least the UAE could do was to 
swiftly conclude an Article 98 agreement. 
 
¶4. (C) Post will follow up with the MFA to ensure prompt 
implementation of Hamdan's promise.
