¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY. EMBASSY ROME, EMBASSY VATICAN, AND THE 
U.S. MISSION TO U.N. AGENCIES IN ROME (FODAG) HAVE 
ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING PRIORITIES FOR 2003: 
 
--ADVANCE THE U.S.- EU TRADE AGENDA; 
 
--MOVE THE GOI TOWARD SCIENCE-BASED POLICY FOUNDATIONS 
AND DECISIONS, FOCUSING ON THE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE. 
HEAVY LIFTING FROM WASHINGTON REQUIRED. (SEE REF C.) 
 
--CONTINUE "BOTTOM-UP" OUTREACH TO IMPROVE PUBLIC 
ACCESS TO OBJECTIVE INFORMATION ABOUT BIOTECHNOLOGY, 
PARTICULARLY AMONG FARMERS, THE MEDIA, AND CONSUMER GROUPS. 
 
--DEEPEN SCIENTIFIC CONTACTS AND EXCHANGES, CREATING 
FORA FOR VISITING U.S. SCIENTISTS TO ADDRESS PUBLIC CONCERNS 
ABOUT THE SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY. 
TIMELY OES SUPPORT IS NEEDED. (SEE PARA 12.) 
 
-- SUPPORT BIOTECH ACTIVITIES IN ROME-BASED UN BASED AGENCIES 
AND BLOCK ANTI-BIOTECH RESOLUTIONS IN UN POLICY MAKING 
BODIES.  ENCOURAGE THE UN TO TAKE A PRO-ACTIVE, SCIENCE-BASED 
APPROACH. 
 
-- EMPHASIZE THE BENEFITS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FROM WISE 
USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, PARTICULARLY WITH ROME-BASED DIPLOMATS 
ACCREDITED TO THE FAO AND THE VATICAN. 
 
THIS CABLE OUTLINES SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES AND A TIMELINE.  IT 
ALSO INCLUDES 1) A REQUEST FOR EB FUNDING SUPPORT TO AUGMENT 
LOCAL RESOURCES AND; 2) A REQUEST TO OES TO PROVIDE 
DEPARTMENT CONCURRENCE AND FORMAL SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH 
COLLABORATIONS WITH THE GOI IN SEVERAL ASPECTS OF 
BIOTECHNOLOGY (SEE PARA 12).  END SUMMARY. 
 
SHARED TRI-MISSION GOALS 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) THE PRINCIPAL GOALS OF THE TRI-MISSION 
BIOTECHNOLOGY WORKING GROUP ARE TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO 
INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND TO PROMOTE 
THE TECHNOLOGY AS A USEFUL TOOL IN ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT IN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  FOR THE 
BILATERAL MISSION, WE HAVE ANALYZED THE GOI POLITICAL STAKES, 
PROSPECTS FOR PROGRESS, AND SUGGESTED DEPARTMENT ACTION IN 02 
ROME 6137.  THIS MESSAGE ACCORDINGLY FOCUSES ON FURTHERING 
THESE GOALS WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. 
 
SUPPORTING TECHNOLOGY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD 
 
¶4.  (SBU) FODAG AND EMBASSY VATICAN LEAD THE ROME EFFORT TO 
STRENGTHEN THE SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF BIOTECHNOLOGY AND 
ITS POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND 
ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.  THE DIRECT VOICES 
OF SCIENTISTS AND LEADERS FROM THE DEVELOPING WORLD ARE VITAL 
IN HELPING TO PERSUADE A SKEPTICAL CATHOLIC CHURCH THAT 
BIOTECHNOLOGY REPRESENTS PART OF THE PATHWAY TO A BETTER LIFE 
IN SOME OF THE WORLD'S POOREST AND HUNGRIEST COUNTRIES.  OUR 
AIM IS TO HAVE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH PLAY A POSITIVE/PROACTIVE 
ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY ON BEHALF OF THE 
DEVELOPING WORLD. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) THE UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) IS 
RESPECTED AS A NEUTRAL, SCIENCE-BASED SOURCE OF INFORMATION 
ON AGRICULTURE AND HAS CREDIBILITY THAT NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS 
OR THE PRIVATE SECTOR MAY LACK.  THE FAO'S FIELD PRESENCE IN 
MOST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES GIVES IT AN ENORMOUS POTENTIAL FOR 
OUTREACH.  FURTHERMORE, MOST OF THE FAO'S MEMBER NATIONS 
MAINTAIN PERMANENT MISSIONS IN ROME, MANY OF WHICH ARE 
STAFFED WITH OFFICIALS WITH EXPERTISE IN AGRICULTURE AND/OR 
DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE.   HOWEVER, FAO HAS NOT FULFILLED ITS 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE ITS MEMBER NATIONS STAKEHOLDERS 
WITH ACCURATE AND UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON BIOTECHNOLOGY
