SUBJECT:  UAE EXPECTS CLOSED-DOOR "DAY AFTER" 
DISCUSSION AT GCC FM MEETING 
 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (S) In conversations on April 5 and April 6 with 
the Ambassador, UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff LTG 
Shaykh Muhammad bin Zayid Al-Nahyan and MFA Minstate 
Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid both expected that the GCC 
Foreign Ministers would broach the Iraq "day after" 
issue but that there would be no public commentary 
on the discussion.  As for GCC participation in any 
post-conflict peacekeeping operations, Hamdan said 
he expected an invitation to be extended -- either 
to the Arab League or the GCC -- by an Iraqi entity, 
such as the Iraqi Interim Authority.  This would be 
more palatable than a USG/coalition invitation, in 
his view. 
 
¶3. (S) Addressing overall day after concerns, Hamdan 
advised that we reach out to the Iraqi tribes and 
clans who would put forward their leaders to 
participate in the Interim Authority.  Above all, 
Hamdan emphasized that the Iraqis need to be seen as 
choosing their leaders.  This cannot be a USG- 
engineered process, at least not overtly.  If those 
put forward are seen to have been imposed by the 
USG, we will only feed further anti-American 
extremism.  Hamdan recognized the need for the U.S. 
to play a strong role in post-conflict security and 
maintenance of the peace but noted the importance of 
having a public Iraqi face to these efforts.
