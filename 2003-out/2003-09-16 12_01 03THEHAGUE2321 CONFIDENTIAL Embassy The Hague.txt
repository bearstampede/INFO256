¶1.     (C) On September 10, EconCouns and EconOff delivered 
ref A demarche to MFA South Asia Division Director Wilfred 
Mohr.  Mohr did not specify what amount the Netherlands plans 
to contribute for 2004, but he predicted that levels would be 
lower than in the past two years due to tightening ODA 
budgets.  The Netherlands has contributed EUR 70 million over 
the past two years to the Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund 
(ARTF) and Mohr expects the bulk of FY 04 funds also to be 
directed to the ARTF.  The Dutch favor funding Afghan 
reconstruction through the ARTF because, in their words, it 
allows the Afghans to decide their own priorities.  That 
notwithstanding, Mohr said the Dutch will likely continue 
bilateral support for the police academy, judicial training 
for the ANA, the mid-term budget review, and the electoral 
process.  The MFA is considering using some of its "Stability 
Fund" (ref C) to cover its Afghanistan contributions. 
MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
