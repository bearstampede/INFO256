(S) Econoff delivered reftel information on Iranian entities 
involved in missile-related procurement programs to Tevfik 
Mengu, Director General for Agreements at the Turkish Foreign 
Trade Undersecretariat, on April 15.  Mengu thanked Econoff 
for the information, but said, as he has in response to 
previous nonproliferation demarches, that his agency could 
take preventive action only if trade transactions were found 
to be in violation of international sanctions or domestic 
law.  In other cases of apparently legitimate trade by 
suspect companies, Foreign Trade would be limited to passing 
information to us on the activities of those companies.
