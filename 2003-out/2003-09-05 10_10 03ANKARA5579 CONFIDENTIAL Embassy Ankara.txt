terrorist finance portfolio from Deputy Director General 
Hakan Okcal. Arda,s last posting was as Deputy Permanent 
Representative of Turkey to the OECD and his previous 
assignments included the UN, as a result of which he is

awaiting approval by the UN 1267 Committee before acting 
administratively on terrorist designations (Ref B). Econoffs 
delivered to Arda copies of UNSC Resolution 1373 and the UN 
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, 
and suggested that these documents provide an alternative, 
and broader, legal basis upon which to act administratively, 
as they are not limited to entities associated with UBL or 
the Taliban. Arda stated that he would research this issue. 
 
 
¶6.    (C) Arda opined that Turkish National Police might need 
more training on terrorist financing issues. He noted, for 
example, that even for PKK financing, Turkish law enforcement 
had been late to identify and freeze assets.
