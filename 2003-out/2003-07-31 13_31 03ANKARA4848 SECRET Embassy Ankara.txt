¶2. (S) Action Request:  MFA DG for Middle East Affairs 
Burcuoglu called July 31 to inform Charge that members of 
DEHAP (the political front of the PKK/KADEK) had entered Iraq 
via Jordan and had already met with refugees at UNHCR's 
Mahmour Refugee Camp.  According to the information, which 
originally came from TGS, the DEHAP politicians also planned 
to meet with KDP, PUK, PKK/KADEK, and possibly US officials. 
Burcuoglu relayed U/S Ziyal's request that the Embassy 
prevent any meeting with the PKK/KADEK.  Embassy Ankara does 
not see any USG or GOT benefit in meeting the DEHAP 
officials, thereby adding to their credibility.  DEHAP has 
been unsupportive of the GOT's "amnesty" law and cannot be 
relied upon to persuade PKK/KADEK members to take advantage 
of this opportunity and avoid confrontation with US security 
forces in Iraq.  Further it is clear that by meeting with 
PKK/KADEK, DEHAP will: 
-  create pressure against implementation of the GOT's 
reintegration law, 
-  increase pressure to ban DEHAP in Turkey with a resultant 
impact on Turkey's political reform effort, 
-  and increase questions about the US attitude toward the 
PKK/KADEK in Iraq. 
Embassy requests US officials in Iraq not meet with the DEHAP 
delegation or, at least use any contact to argue against 
DEHAP's meeting with PKK/KADEK.  Furthermore, we request the 
KDP and PUK to advise the DEHAP del not to meet with the 
PKK/KADEK. 
 
 
¶3. (S) A/PolCouns called DEHAP Vice Chairman Veli Buyuksahin 
and made the following points 1) we understand the DEHAP 
delegation was planning to meet with PKK/KADEK, which we 
regard as a terrorist group; 2) the US Embassy will never 
meet with any delegation member who has met with the 
PKK/KADEK; 3) by meeting with PKK/KADEK, DEHAP as a party 
will damage and could destroy its relationship with the US 
Embassy; and 4) the relationship between DEHAP and the USG 
will not protect the party from GOT retaliation.  He 
acknowledged the points but made no comment.
