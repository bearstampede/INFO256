REF: STATE 238713 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Charge d'Affaires Tim Smith passed reftel 
information on high-risk sources of radiation to Djiboutian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Secretary Badri Ali Bogoreh 
October 2. Bogoreh looked at the information and promised to 
pass it to the Djiboutian National Research Center.  He 
believes, however, that there are very few sources of 
radioactivity, including X-ray machines, in Djibouti, and 
that most of those machines and materials would be in the 
hands of the French or U.S. military.
