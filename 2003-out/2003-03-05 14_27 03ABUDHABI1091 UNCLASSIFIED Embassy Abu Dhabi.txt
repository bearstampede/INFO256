¶1.  This cable has been coordinated with Congen Dubai. 
 
¶2.  We offer the following comments in response to reftel 
request for a summary of Post's actions in 2002 to 
encourage respect for human rights in the United Arab 
Emirates. 
 
¶3.  Since its independence in 1971, the United Arab 
Emirates has transcended rapidly from an undeveloped 
country to a dynamic regional economic power with an 
advanced infrastructure and a diverse urbanized population. 
In the process, the UAE Government has granted increasing 
protection for human rights in many areas.  Embassy Abu 
Dhabi and Consulate Dubai have encouraged the continuation 
and broadening of this progression through a strong public 
diplomacy program and an active dialogue with all levels of 
government and civil society. 
 
¶4.  Throughout the year, the Embassy and Consulate General 
used public diplomacy programs to encourage respect for 
human rights.  We utilized the numerous visits of U.S. 
government officials, NGOs and private individuals as tools 
to engage with the government, civil society and the public 
through media interviews, lectures, roundtables and hosted 
gatherings for various political, academic, and social 
leaders.  We also used official functions to promote human 
rights, for example, at the annual Independence Day 
reception we used a photographic exhibition to highlight 
the role of minorities and immigrants in the development of 
our country. 
 
¶5.  We continued to highlight and promote the role of 
women, journalists and civil society activists in a number 
of ways.  To encourage the enhanced participation of women 
in public life and business, the Ambassador met regularly 
with UAE First Lady Shaykha Fatima Bint Mubarak and other 
women leaders and hosted regular get-togethers for women 
from numerous disciplines.  The Public Affairs Section 
hosted a Ramadan iftar for journalists and embassy 
officials, and awarded a public diplomacy grant to the 
country's largest environmental NGO, which is led by an 
Emirati woman. 
 
¶6.  At the encouragement of embassy and consulate 
officials, a number of Emirati officials, academics, 
journalists and other individuals participated in 
International Visitor Programs and other exchanges and 
conferences that included components promoting respect for 
human rights.  For example, two police officers attended an 
International Visitor Program on monitoring and combating 
trafficking in persons.  And, the Embassy facilitated the 
attendance of a Ministry of Justice official in a judicial 
reform exchange program. 
 
¶7.  To highlight our commitment to the advancement and 
protection of human rights in the area of trafficking in 
persons, the Ambassador added trafficking in persons to the 
agenda for the first U.S.-UAE Strategic Dialogue in 
November 2002 to build on the excellent strides made by the 
UAE Government in the implementation and enforcement of a 
child camel jockey ban in September 2002.  And, furthering 
the U.S. policy of promoting religious freedom, we 
expressed concern to the UAEG about the prosecution of an 
expatriate pastor for proselytizing. 
 
¶8.  In 2003, Post will continue to pursue an activist 
approach with the UAEG.  An official visit in January 2003 
by Department of State officials from the Office to Monitor 
and Combat Trafficking in Persons provided an excellent 
opportunity to engage senior Emiratis on this important 
transnational crime and human rights issue.  We will 
continue to utilize the annual reports on human rights, 
religious freedom and trafficking in persons as tools to 
promote and encourage respect for human rights in the UAE.
