SUBJECT: IRAQI RECONSTRUCTION: CANADIAN PERSONNEL FOR 
BAGHDAD 
 
 
THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST - SEE PARA 3. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Canada has committed to providing US$215 million in 
humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for post-conflict 
Iraq, with emphasis on access to basic services (water, 
sanitation, health care); building democratic institutions; 
reforming judicial, police and correctional services; 
strengthening civil society; and promoting human rights.  As 
part of this effort, the GoC is trying to deploy two 
officials to Baghdad who would serve as a national liaison to 
the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and as police 
advisor to the CPA, respectively. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ann Flanagan, Deputy Director of Foreign Affairs' 
Middle East Division, has requested our assistance in getting 
CPA approval for these Canadian officers.  The GoC has 
proposed that FSO Ben Rowswell be attached to the CPA as 
Canadian national liaison, and that RCMP officer David Beer 
be deployed as police advisor to the CPA.  Beer was part of 
the multinational police assessment team that visited Iraq 
for 4 weeks in June, during which time he served for 3 weeks 
as principal advisor to the Chief of Police for Baghdad West. 
 Both Rowswell and Beer are available to deploy immediately, 
and they have already been proposed by the Canadian Embassy 
in Washington. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Please advise ASAP on the Canadians' 
proposals to deploy Rowswell and Beer to the CPA.  Having 
these two individuals in place will help bolster policing 
efforts and speed the delivery of Canadian assistance, 
especially given the absence of a Canadian Embassy in Baghdad.
