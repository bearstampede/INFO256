SUBJECT: GUATEMALA SUPPORTS CUBA RESOLUTION AT OAS 
 
REF: STATE 9937 
 
Classified By: Ambassador John Hamilton for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) In the absence of Foreign Minister Gutierrez, Embassy 
raised reftel points with Director General for Multilateral 
Affairs, Giovanni Castillo on April 21, 2003.  Castillo 
agreed that the OAS Permanent Council is an appropriate venue 
for a human rights resolution on Cuba.  Castillo cautioned 
that he could not speak officially without reviewing the 
actual text, but then assured us that Guatemala would support 
an OAS resolution along the lines proposed in reftel. 
Castillo said that Nicaraguan and Costa Rican co-sponsorship 
would reinforce Guatemala's support for the resolution and 
speculated that El Salvador and Honduras would be almost 
certain to support it as well.  Castillo emphasized that 
under those circumstances it would be "impossible" for 
Guatemala to oppose the resolution.
