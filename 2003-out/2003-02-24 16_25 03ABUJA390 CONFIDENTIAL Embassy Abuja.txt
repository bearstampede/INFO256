CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER. REASON 1.5(b). 
 
 
¶1.  (C) DCM February 22 delivered ref A points to MFA 
Permanent Secretary Ambassador T.D. Hart.  Hart took the USG 
position on board, promising to convey it to FM Sule Lamido. 
 
 
¶2.  (C) COMMENT: Nigeria believes that Iraq must be disarmed 
through the UN Security Council but that Saddam must realize 
that the USG will not stand down its forces without a strong 
justification.  Detail on Nigeria's position is contained in 
refs C&D.  Hart echoed ref A points as DCM made them, but it 
was not clear whether he did so out of personal or official 
agreement or was simply reiterating to make sure he grasped 
them fully. 
 
 
¶3.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: President Obasanjo makes his own 
decisions on foreign policy issues and was already in Kuala 
Lumpur by Saturday morning, Nigeria time.  The President's 
International Affairs Advisor, Ad'Obe Obe, accompanied his 
boss to Singapore and Malaysia.  Obe is clear-headed, knows 
Nigeria's national interests and can influence Obasanjo on 
foreign policy issues.  He has been accessible to us in Abuja. 
Lamido, on the other hand, often succumbs to the allure of 
stand-up-to-the-West NAM "solidarity" and may be harder for 
the USG to engage effectively.  Hart noted, however, that it 
was Lamido (in Kuala Lumpur since Friday) who was involved in 
the "nitty-gritty" of drafting the statement.  END COMMENT. 
 
 
¶4.  (U) Note: Abuja does not seem to be a member of the NAM 
Collective.  We will request inclusion septel.  The Department 
is requested to insert Abuja as a separate addressee until 
such time as the collective can be updated.
