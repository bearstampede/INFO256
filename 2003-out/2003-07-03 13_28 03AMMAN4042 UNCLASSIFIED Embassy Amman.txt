Assembly (reported septel), A/PolCouns delivered ref talking 
points requesting GOJ support for the Costa Rican resolution 
on human cloning. Braizat suggested that GOJ decisions 
regarding a cloning convention would likely be made in New 
York and would likely involve the input of several GOJ 
actors.  All three officials emphasized the complexity of the 
issue.

the UN,s Ad Hoc Committee on an International Convention 
against the Reproductive Cloning of Human Beings in early

informed on this issue.
