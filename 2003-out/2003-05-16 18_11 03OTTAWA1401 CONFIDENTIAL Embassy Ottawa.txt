SUBJECT: TAIWAN OBSERVERSHIP AT THE WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY: 
CANADIAN POSITION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 130140 
 
Classified By: Curtis Stone, ESTH Counselor.  Reasons 1.5 (b,d). 
 
Â¶1. (C) As requested in reftel, ESTH Counselor made points on 
observer status for Taiwan to Ross Snyder, Deputy Director 
for UN Specialized Agencies, Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade (DFAIT).  Snyder indicated that he 
was well aware of the issue and would pass our views along to 
appropriate members of the Canadian delegation to the WHA, 
most of whom had already left for Geneva.  He said that the 
GOC sees the benefits that would accrue from Taiwan having 
observer status at the WHO.  While not prepared to take an 
active role in pressing the case for Taiwan, Canada would 
support any consensus on this issue that met the concerns of 
both China and Taiwan.
