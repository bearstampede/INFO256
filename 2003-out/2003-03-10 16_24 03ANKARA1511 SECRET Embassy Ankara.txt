(S) MFA Director General for Middle Eastern Affairs Tahsin 
Burcuoglu told DCM March 10 that the MFA had forwarded the 
list of PPE for northern Iraq to the TGS.  Noting that the 
list seemed to include more commo gear than protective 
equipment, he said the list did not mean much to the MFA.  He 
suspected the TGS might have some questions or requests for 
clarification about the list.
