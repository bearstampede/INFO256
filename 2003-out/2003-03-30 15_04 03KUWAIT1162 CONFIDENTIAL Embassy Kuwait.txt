Classified By: DCM Frank C. Urbancic for reasons 1.5. (B) and (D) 
 
¶1. (C) Detailed Kuwaiti production figures are unavailable 
today, but total production is understood to remain above 2.4 
million barrels per day. 
 
¶2. (C) A senior KPC official confirmed today that all three 
refineries of the Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation (Mina 
Al-Ahmadi, Mina Al-Abdulla and Shuaiba) have resumed full 
operations and are refining some 915,000 barrels of oil per 
day.  All three trains at the LPG plant are also operating 
normally.  On March 21, KPC had reported that it had scaled 
back operations to 625,000 bpd and closed one LPG train due 
to the threat of missile attacks.  However, the KPC official 
noted the firm's continuing nervousness over the security of 
its refinery operations, particularly in the light of the 
explosion of an Iraqi missile early in the morning of March 
29 which caused some minor damage to a Kuwait City shopping 
mall.  The shopping mall is less than 20 miles 
north-northwest of the refinery complex.
