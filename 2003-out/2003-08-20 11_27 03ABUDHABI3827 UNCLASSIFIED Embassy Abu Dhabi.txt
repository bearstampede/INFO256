CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT OF IGC

¶1. (U) UAE MinState for Foreign Affairs Sheikh 
Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan (HbZ) issued a 
statement August 20 condemning the attack on the 
UN headquarters in Baghdad, and calling on the 
international community to stand united in 
supporting the UN and the Iraqi Governing 
Council (GC) to restore security and stability 
in Iraq.  The statement comes a day after the 
UAEG expressed strong public support for the 
visiting GC delegation led by Council President 
Dr. Ahmed Al-Jafari (see reftel). 
 
¶2. (U) HbZ labeled the August 19 truck bombing a 
"criminal and cowardly" act that targeted the 
international organization, its values, 
principles and humanitarian mission as well as 
its efforts to help Iraq restore its security 
and stability and protect its independence and 
territorial integrity.  This aggression exposes 
the real enemies of Iraq, peace and stability." 
 
¶3. (U) He added that such a crime obligates the 
international community to take a decisive 
position and to redouble and intensify the UN 
efforts in Iraq.  He also called for the support 
of the Iraqi Governing Council to enable it to 
achieve security, stability and the 
reconstruction of Iraq. 
 
¶4. (U) HbZ offered his condolences to UNSYG Kofi 
Annan and to the families and victims of the 
blast.
