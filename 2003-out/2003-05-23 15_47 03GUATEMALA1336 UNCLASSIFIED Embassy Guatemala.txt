TAGS: PREL GT
SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON POSSIBLE PUERTO RICAN REQUEST FOR 
RECOGNITION 
 
REF: STATE 131326 
 
PolOff discussed reftel points with Marco Tulio Chicas, 
Deputy Director for Multilateral Affairs at the Foreign 
Ministry on May 21.  Chicas, who is the MFA's action officer 
for the Central American Integration System (SICA), confirmed 
that Puerto Rico had requested Guatemalan support in its bid 
for permanent observer status in SICA and said he believed 
Puerto Rico had made the same request in all SICA capitals. 
Guatemala's response to Puerto Rico, according to Chicas, has 
been to merely receive the request.  Chicas stated that the 
MFA understood the logic or our points and added that no 
decisions would be made until the MFA's legal department 
reviewed the request.  We would note, however, that Puerto 
Rico sought and obtained observer status at the Central 
American Parliament in October of 2001.
