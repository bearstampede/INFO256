SUBJECT:  WHAT YONDER LIGHT DOTH SHINE?  UAE NEWSPAPER 
PUBLISHES POLL ON UAE NATIONAL ATTITUDES 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  ARABIC DAILY AL KHALEEJ NEWSPAPER 
RECENTLY PUBLISHED A TWO-PART COMMENTARY ON A POLL CONDUCTED 
RANDOMLY OF 500 UAE NATIONALS IN SEVERAL UAE CITIES.  THE POLL 
ASKED A WIDE RANGE OF QUESTIONS ON POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND 
RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES.  FOR THE FIRST TIME, A UAE PAPER 
PUBLISHED STATISTICS ON POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, INDICATING 
THAT 10 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS THINK "POLITICAL PARTICIPATION" 
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT NATIONAL ISSUE.  WHAT IS ALSO REMARKABLE 
IS THAT A SCIENTIFIC POLL OF POPULAR ATTITUDES WAS PUBLISHED 
IN A WIDELY READ PAPER, SOMETHING RARELY SEEN IN THE UAE AND 
LENDING FURTHER CREDENCE TO PRIVATE REMARKS BY UAEG OFFICIALS 
THAT JOURNALISTS HAVE A LOT MORE LATITUDE THAN THEY BELIEVE. 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT.

¶4.  COMMENT:  THE RESULTS GIVE US A USEFUL GLIMPSE AT 
NATIONALS' ATTITUDES TOWARD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, POLITICAL 
PARTICIPATION.  ALSO, BREAKING DOWN THE RESPONSES BY MEN 
VERSUS WOMEN YIELDS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ATTITUDES IN 
SEVERAL AREAS.  WOMEN ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH GETTING AN 
EDUCATION AND A JOB AND SPEND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR 
TIME INDOORS, SURFING THE INTERNET OR WATCHING TV.  THIS GELS 
WITH PA AND POL STAFF EXPERIENCE IN TALKING WITH FEMALE 
STUDENTS AT ZAYED UNIVERSITY OR THE UAE UNIVERSITY, WHERE 
INFORMATION FROM SATELLITE TV AND THE INTERNET IS A PRIMARY 
SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE. 
 
¶5.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS TYPE OF POLL, WITH A VARIETY OF 
OPINIONS FOR AND AGAINST THE OFFICIAL UAEG LINE, HAS NEVER 
BEEN PUBLISHED IN SUCH A PROMINENT UAE NEWSPAPER.  TYPICALLY, 
THE UAE'S PAPERS USE INFORMAL "MAN ON THE STREET" SURVEYS TO 
PULSE PULIC OPINION.  PUBLICATION OF THIS MORE SCIENTIFIC POLL 
LENDS CREDIBILITY TO PRIVATE REMARKS BY SENIOR UAEG OFFICIALS 
THAT JOURNALISTS HAVE MUCH MORE FREEDOM THAN THEY CURRENTLY 
EXERCISE.  WHILE THE UAEG HAS ALSO MADE CLEAR THAT 
ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE RECENTLY TERMINATED ZAYED CENTER FOR 
COORDINATION AND FOLLOWUP WILL NOT BE TOLERATED, THE 
PUBLICATION OF THIS POLL IS YET ANOTHER SIGNAL THAT THE UAEG, 
BUILT ON THE CONSERVATIVE FOUNDATIONS OF TRIBAL CONSENSUS, IS 
WILLING TO ALLOW THE MEDIA TO PUBLISH ITS CITIZENS' DISCUSSION 
OF THE COUNTRY'S ISSUES.  END COMMENT.
