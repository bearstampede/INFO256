SUBJECT: EMIRATI ATTENDANCE AT MARRAKESH WOMEN'S SUMMIT 
 
REF: STATE 121501 
 
¶1.  Embassy Abu Dhabi and Consulate General Dubai have 
identified prospective Emirati participants in the upcoming 
2003 Global Women's Summit in Marrakesh on 28-30 June, and 
will encourage their attendance.  These prospective 
attendees include high-profile women in government, 
business, and the NGO community.  In an effort to also 
encourage wider Emirati attendance, we plan to engage with 
our contacts at the Ministry of Information to request 
their assistance in informing the public by placing 
articles about the Summit in the UAE's English and Arabic 
dailies. 
 
¶2.  We intend to contact H.E. Nora Al-Suweidi, Director for 
the UAE General Women's Union (GWU) and Undersecretary for 
the Ministry of Education and Youth, and encourage the 
attendance of GWU members.  The GWU, chaired by UAE First 
Lady Shaykha Fatima bint Mubarak, is a federation comprised 
of the seven, emirate-level women's unions and is the 
primary promoter of women's issues in the UAE.  It is 
considered the UAE Government's de facto ministry of 
women's affairs, and its leader typically serves as the UAE 
government's women's affairs representative at 
international conferences. 
 
¶3.  On 11 May, EconOff confirmed that the Abu Dhabi 
National Businesswomen's Council -- a Global Summit 
International Partner Organization -- will be sending three 
representatives to the Summit, including its Executive 
Committee Chairperson Dr. Rawda Al-Mutawwa.  We will also 
forward information on the Summit to Dubai Businesswomen's 
Committee's leadership for distribution to its membership.
