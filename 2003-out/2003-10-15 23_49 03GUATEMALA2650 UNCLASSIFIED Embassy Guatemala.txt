Sylvia Corado, Director for Multilateral Affairs at the 
Foreign Ministry, told us on October 15 that Guatemala 
continues to consult internally and has not yet decided 
whether it will co-sponsor the Costa Rican Resolution. 
Corado was familiar with the substance of the resolution and 
promised to inform the Embassy as soon as the GOG reaches its 
decision on cosponsorship.  Corado was unwilling to speculate 
at this point on whether Guatemala would vote for the 
resolution even if it decides not to cosponsor.
