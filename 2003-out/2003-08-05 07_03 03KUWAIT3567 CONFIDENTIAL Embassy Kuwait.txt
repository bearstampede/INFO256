TAGS: EAID ECON PREL KU IZ
SUBJECT: U/S JARALLAH ON CIC REPRESENTATIVE 
 
REF: A. STATE 206458 B. KUWAIT 03266 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para. 3. 
 
¶2. (C) The Ambassador raised the issue of Kuwait's 
designation of a Council for International Coordination (CIC) 
representative with MFA U/S Khaled Al-Jarallah during their 
July 27 meeting.  Jarallah said that Kuwaiti participation 
would be "difficult" because the GOK had no official presence 
on the ground in Iraq.  When reminded by the Ambassador that 
the GOK does have Ministry of Interior officials there as 
part of Task Force Hope, Jarallah indicated Kuwait should be 
willing to designate a representative, as long as security 
could be assured.  (Note: Kuwait currently has 7 Ministry of 
Interior and 2 Ministry of Defense personnel attached to Task 
Force Hope.  All are there under the auspices of coalition 
forces, to search for Kuwaitis missing since the Iraqi 
occupation.  End Note.) 
 
¶2. (C) Action Request:  Post requests department's assistance 
in ascertaining what living and security arrangements will be 
made for CIC representatives, so we may pass this on for GOK 
consideration. 
 
¶3. (U) Baghdad minimize considered.
