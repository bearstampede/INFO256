DEAL 
 
 
(U) Classified by CDA Richard Albright, for reasons 1.5 (B) 
and (D).  This contains business proprietary information 
 
¶1. (C) On October 27, David Scott, General Manager of Oxy 
of Abu Dhabi (protect) told Econchief that Occidental 
Petroleum, along with the UAE Offsets Group and other 
consortium partners, was in the initial stages of a large 
gas to liquids (GTL) project with Qatar.  The consortium 
has signed an MOU with the GoQ and is currently engaged in 
technology testing in the U.S.  According to Scott, if the 
project goes forward it will be the second largest GTL deal 
in the world at 120,000 barrels of liquids a day and would 
draw from Qatar's North Field.  He suggested that his 
company would decide early next year whether to continue 
with the project.  (Note:  Occidental Petroleum, the UAE 
Offsets Group and Total are partners in the Dolphin Energy 
project to bring gas from Qatar to the UAE.) 
 
¶2. (C) Scott also expressed concern that Oxy's UAE partners 
could have problems obtaining visas to go to the U.S. to 
participate in the project and in the briefings.
