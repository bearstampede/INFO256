SUBJECT: OTTAWA:  LETTER FROM U/S LARSON AND TAYLOR ON 
FILING THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT'S FINANCING GAP 
 
REF: STATE 105217 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) We delivered reftel message April 25 to Hau Sing 
Tse, Vice-President of the Canadian International Development 
 
SIPDIS 
Agency (CIDA) and to Jonathan Fried, Senior Assistant Deputy 
Minister of Finance, with a copy to the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade.  The GOC is discussing allocation of its 
remaining aid commitments, and hopes to have a proposal for 
approval by Minister Whelan by early June. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  A CIDA official confirmed that of Canada's 
two-year, C$250 million pledge in Brussels, C$23.5 million 
has been committed to the ARTF for this year's operational 
expenses, with another allocation planned for next year. 
That timing is now being reconsidered. Canada plans to focus 
its development assistance on livelihoods; natural resources 
(including agriculture); and security/rule of law.  Between 
now and early June the GOC is consulting with the Afghan 
government and other donors to determine the major outline of 
its allocations of development and operational assistance, 
and the extent to which development funds can be redirected 
to the ARTF.
