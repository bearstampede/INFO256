SUBJECT: UAEG IS CONSIDERING WIPO INTERNET TREATIES 
 
REF:  STATE 174725 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Acting DCM Thomas E. Williams for 
reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (C) Econoff delivered ref demarche, as well as an 
Arabic translation of WIPO's Digital Agenda, to UAE 
Ministry of Information Director of Copyrights Ali Al- 
Baloushi on June 21.  Al-Baloushi noted that the protection 
of intellectual property on the Internet, and the expansion 
of e-commerce, is a priority for the UAEG.  The UAEG is 
carefully studying the language of the WIPO treaties, with 
the intention of acceding within the next year. 
 
¶3.  (C) Al-Baloushi recounted the several steps that the 
UAEG -- and Dubai Government, in particular -- has taken to 
protect intellectual property on the Internet.  The UAEG 
enacted in July 2002 Law No. 7 for Copyright and 
Neighboring Rights, which in addition to other works, 
affords protection to computer software and databases. 
Also in 2002, the Dubai Government passed the "Law of 
Electronic Transactions and Commerce No. 2/2002," which 
protects certain electronic records and signatures, and 
some electronic communications.  The Dubai law also 
provides penalties for any person who knowingly creates, 
publishes or otherwise makes available a false signature or 
certificate, or provides false statements online for 
fraudulent or any other unlawful purpose.  Most recently in 
March 2003, the International Bar Association hosted a 
conference in Dubai entitled, "Middle East Law and the 
Internet Age."  The conference addressed the legal 
developments related to new technologies, with a focus on 
e-commerce in the Middle East. 
 
¶4.  (C) Comment: Dubai already has taken important steps 
consistent with the spirit of the WIPO Internet Treaties to 
protect intellectual property on the web.  Federal-level 
legislation probably will trail the efforts of more 
progressive Dubai -- the future success of Dubai Internet 
City and Dubai International Financial Center will depend 
on the Government's ability to protect electronic 
transactions and intellectual property rights in 
cyberspace.  Al-Baloushi said that the UAEG is working 
closely with WIPO to create and implement an effective IPR 
regime that meets international standards.  We will 
continue to monitor and report the UAE's progress in this 
area, and forward any request for USG assistance that we 
receive.  End comment.
