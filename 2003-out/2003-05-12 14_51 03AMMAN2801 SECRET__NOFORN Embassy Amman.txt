SUBJECT: JORDANIAN MILITARY PROSECUTOR CHARGES 11 WITH 
MURDER OF LARRY FOLEY 
 
¶1. (SBU) The military prosecutor indicted 11 people on May 11 
involved in the plot to assassinate USAID employee Larry 
Foley.  Jordanian officials have captured and detained four 
of the accused, including the possible trigger man, but seven 
remain at large outside of Jordan, including the accused 
ringleader of the cell, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.  Post expects a 
trial date to be announced in the near future.  According to 
the temporary terrorism law that was issued in October, 2001, 
any terrorist act that results in death is a capital crime 
and the State Security Court, which will oversee the case, 
may seek the death penalty for some of the accused. 
 
¶2. (S/NF) Comment: The GOJ did not inform us of these 
indictments before the public statement was made.  ORCA is 
seeking more information through its channels.
