(C) We delivered points contained reftel to Luke Sookocheff, 
Human Rights Officer in DFAIT's Human Rights, Humanitarian 
Affairs and International Women's Equality Division, on April 
Â¶11. In a follow-up discussion April 17, Sookocheff told 
poloff that Canada agrees the plight of the Bhutanese 
refugees in Nepal is unacceptable, and that Canada has sent 
and will continue to send that message to the governments of 
Bhutan and Nepal. Sookocheff said Canada would urge Bhutan to 
finalize its negotiations with Nepal, to work closely with 
UNHCR on a repatriation/integration plan, and to begin 
repatriation as soon as possible. Sookocheff indicated that 
Canada remains interested in participating in third country 
resettlement efforts as part of a comprehensive settlement of 
the refugee problem. (Note: While Canada's mission in New 
Delhi has been responsible for Bhutan, Sookocheff said that 
Canada is in the process of establishing diplomatic relations 
with Thimphu and expects to open a 1-person post there this 
year. End note.)
