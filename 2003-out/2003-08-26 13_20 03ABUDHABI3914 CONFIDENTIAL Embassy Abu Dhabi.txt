SUBJECT: SYRIAN FM SHARA'A VISITS UAE 
 
Classified by Richard A. Albright, Charge 
d'Affaires, a.i., for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Syrian Foreign Minister Shara'a 
visited the UAE August 24-25, meeting with Abu 
Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed al- 
Nahyan and with Information Minister Sheikh 
Abdullah Bin Zayed al-Nahyan.  Shara'a is touring 
the Gulf (in Doha today enroute to Kuwait) to 
organize the October visit of President Bashar, 
according to a readout the Syrian Ambassador 
provided Charge.  The visit was short on substance. 
End summary. 
 
¶2. (C) In their August 25 meeting, which was more 
protocolary than substantive, Shara'a and Sheikh 
Khalifa exchanged views on the Palestinian/Israeli 
conflict, Iraq, and an Arab League reform proposal. 
On Palestinian/Israeli developments, the Syrians 
said they want stronger US intervention to control 
Israel.  The Crown Prince's press statement was 
bland, noting the primacy of the US role, and 
adding that the US could use its leverage on Israel 
to comply with international resolutions and 
consequently withdraw from all Arab territories 
occupied in 1967. 
 
¶3. (C) On Iraq, the Syrian Ambassador told Charge 
that Syria was not planning to recognize the IGC, 
and that for now, no IGC visit was planned to 
Damascus.  With respect to Arab League reform, he 
said that Shara'a had raised with the Crown Prince 
an Arab League reform proposal that would move 
voting on some issues from consensus to some form 
of majority vote.  The Syrian Ambassador described 
the discussion as general and had no further 
details to share. 
 
¶4. (U) The Ambassador indicated that Shara'a visit 
was arranged suddenly as he, who was abroad, got 
back to Abu Dhabi only two hours before his Foreign 
Minister's arrival.
