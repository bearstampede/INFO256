¶1. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Following the reported release of detained Turkish 
special forces in northern Iraq, both Kellogg, Brown and Root 
(KBR) and the World Food Program told us that the Habur 
border crossing with Iraq returned to normal operation at 
approximately midday on July 7.  KBR advised that some 300 
fuel trucks held up at the border were now being allowed to 
cross, and the company has resumed loading of fuel for export 
from Turkey.  WFP also reported that the border has reopened, 
but that it could take as long as a week to clear the 
accumulated backlog of trucks.  WFP reports that an 
18-kilometer line of trucks is currently waiting to cross 
into Iraq.  The U.S. Movement Control Team on the Iraqi side 
of the gate also confirmed that the border was apparently 
opened completely at about 13:00 July 7.
