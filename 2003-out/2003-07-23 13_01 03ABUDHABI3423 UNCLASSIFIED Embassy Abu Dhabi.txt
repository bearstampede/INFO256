SUBJECT: UAE CONTRIBUTIONS TO IRAQ TOTAL USD $50 
MILLION 
 
REF: ABU DHABI 2877 
 
¶1. (U) UAE Chief of Staff, and de facto Defense 
Minister, Shaykh Muhammad Bin Zayid Al-Nahyan (MbZ) 
told the Ambassador on July 20 that UAE assistance to 
Iraq already totals USD $50 million.  This 
contribution includes Red Crescent medical and food 
supplies, hospital and medical equipment, continuing 
medical treatment for a number of Iraqis evacuated to 
the UAE in May, and water treatment plants. MbZ 
expects this figure to rise to USD $80 million by the 
end of the year as the Emiratis continue to provide 
the services they have promised. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: The overall UAEG assistance to Iraq 
is substantially greater than just Red Crescent 
contributions (reftel) -- it includes outlays from the 
Defense Ministry as well as ongoing humanitarian 
efforts. The UAEG's commitment to Iraqi reconstruction 
has been steadfast, and as MbZ's statement indicates, 
will continue to be resolute. End comment.
