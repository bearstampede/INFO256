SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) THE DRUZHBADRIA PIPELINE PROJECT IS ONE POSSIBLE 
ROUTE TO BRING RUSSIAN OIL TO WESTERN MARKETS, SOMETHING 
WHICH WOULD ENHANCE GLOBAL ENERGY SECURITY BY INCREASING 
DIVERSIFICATION OF OIL SUPPLIES.  THE CROATIAN PRESS HAS 
SOUGHT TO PORTRAY CROATIA AS A NEW PLAYER IN WORLD OIL 
POLITICS.  HOWEVER, ACTUAL CROATIAN INFLUENCE ON THE SUCCESS 
OF THE PROJECT, AND THE UPFRONT INVESTMENT AND THUS RISK 
CROATIA IS WILLING TO TAKE ON, ARE RELATIVELY SMALL. 
ENVIRONMENTAL OPPOSITION TO THE PIPELINE HAS ARISEN, AND THE 
GOVERNMENT'S WILLINGNESS TO MAKE MORE-THAN-BARE-MINIMUM 
INVESTMENTS IN THE PROJECT COULD WEAKEN IF IT DOES NOT 
RECEIVE CLEAR COMMITMENTS FROM SUPPLIERS AND BUYERS.  SIMILAR 
ISSUES SURROUND THE CPOT (CONSTANTA-PANCEVO-OMISALJ-TRIESTE) 
BOSPORUS BYPASS PIPELINE PROJECT, AS WELL AS CONCERN OVER THE 
LOSS OF SERBIAN AND BOSNIAN EXPORT MARKETS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE DRUZHBADRIA PROJECT 
----------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) ON DECEMBER 16, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SIX 
COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN THE DRUZHBADRIA OIL PIPELINE PROJECT 
SIGNED AN AGREEMENT ON COOPERATION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
PROJECT OF INTEGRATION OF THE "DRUZHBA" AND "ADRIA" OIL 
PIPELINES IN ZAGREB.  THE AGREEMENT WAS THE CULMINATION OF 
FIVE YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS, BUT IMPORTANT ISSUES REMAIN TO BE 
WORKED OUT BEFORE ANY OIL ACTUALLY FLOWS FROM RUSSIAN OIL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00799  01 OF 05  110814Z 
FIELDS, THROUGH UKRAINE, BELARUS, SLOVAKIA AND HUNGARY TO THE 
TERMINUS OF THE DRUZHBA PIPELINE, THEN INTO THE ADRIA 
PIPELINE TO THE CROATIAN PORT OF OMISALJ. 
 
¶3.  (U) CURRENTLY JANAF, THE CROATIAN STATE-OWNED OIL 
PIPELINE COMPANY, RECEIVES OIL AT THE DEEP-WATER PORT OF 
OMISALJ, ON THE NORTHERN CROATIAN ADRIATIC COAST, LESS THAN A 
HUNDRED MILES FROM TRIESTE.  SOME OIL GOES TO THE RIJEKA 
REFINERY, AND THE REST IS PUMPED VIA PIPELINE OVER THE GORSKI 
KOTAR MOUNTAINS TO A REFINERY IN SISAK (SOUTH OF ZAGREB), 
THEN EASTWARDS TOWARDS SERBIA AND NORTHWARD TOWARDS HUNGARY. 
 
¶4.  (U) IN ORDER FOR CROATIA TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN TO 
CREATE A NEW ROUTE FOR THE EXPORT OF RUSSIAN CRUDE TO WESTERN 
EUROPE AND THE U.S., IT WILL NEED TO INSTALL PUMPS CAPABLE OF 
PUMPING OIL IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.  THE INITIAL INVESTMENT 
REQUIRED TO ENABLE JANAF TO ACCOMPLISH THE FIRST-PHASE GOAL 
OF BEING ABLE TO EXPORT FIVE MILLION TONS OF OIL A YEAR COULD 
BE AS LITTLE AS $20 MILLION.  INVESTMENTS OF UP TO $70 TO 80 
MILLION WOULD BE NEEDED TO REALIZE THE FINAL OUTPUT GOAL OF 
15 MILLION TONS PER YEAR.  MUCH OF THE NEW INVESTMENT IS FOR 
STRENGTHENING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES.

¶5.  (SBU) A RELATIVELY SMALL INVESTMENT IS NEEDED IN THE 
SHORT-TERM BECAUSE JANAF'S FACILITIES ARE WOEFULLY 
UNDERUTILIZED.  KRESIMIR BARANOVIC, HEAD OF DEVELOPMENT 
PROJECTS FOR JANAF SAID MOST OF THE NEAR-TERM INVESTMENTS 
WILL BE FOR REVERSIBLE PUMPS AT THE SISAK REFINERY, SOME 
PUMPS AT OMISALJ FOR LOADING OIL ONTO TANKERS, ADDITIONAL 
STORAGE TANKS AT SISAK, AND SOME PIPING AND CONTROL 
EQUIPMENT.  MUCH OF THIS EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN BOUGHT AND SOME 
DELIVERED.  SOME EXISTING PUMPS ARE SIMPLY BEING REPOSITIONED. 
 
PIPELINE BRINGS EXISTING PROBLEMS INTO FOCUS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (U) SOON AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE DRUZHBADRIA AGREEMENT, 
THE MEDIA AND NGOS PROMINENTLY RAISED ENVIRONMENTAL 
QUESTIONS.  THE "ENVIRONMENTALISTS" BREAK DOWN INTO TWO 
GROUPS -- THOSE WHO SIMPLY WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
AND JANAF CONDUCT APPROPRIATE STUDIES AND TAKE THE ADEQUATE 
PRECAUTIONS, AND THOSE WHO THINK THAT ANY ADDITIONAL 
ENVIRONMENTAL RISK TO THE CROATIAN COAST IS UNACCEPTABLE. 
CONCERNS CENTERED ON TWO ISSUES -- THE POSSIBILITY OF AN OIL 
SPILL AND THE EFFECT OF DISCHARGES OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF 
BALLAST WATERS, WHICH COULD INTRODUCE NEW AQUATIC INVASIVE 
SPECIES TO THE CROATIAN ADRIATIC COAST.  LOCALS AND OTHERS 
CITED CONCERNS THAT A LARGE SPILL COULD ENDANGER TOURISM, 
WHICH IS BY FAR CROATIA'S BIGGEST FOREIGN CURRENCY EARNER, 
BRINGING IN AN ESTIMATED $4 BILLION IN REVENUE IN 2002. 
MEDIA REPORTS QUOTE THE PRESIDENT OF JANAF AS SAYING REVENUE 
FLOWS FROM THE DRUZHBADRIA PROJECT WOULD BE $30 MILLION PER 
YEAR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT, INCREASING TO $80 
MILLION AT FULL CAPACITY. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00799  02 OF 05  110814Z 
 
¶7.  (SBU) THE GOVERNMENT, SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFULLY, HAS REBUTTED 
THE OIL-SPILL ARGUMENT BY NOTING THAT THE INTENSITY OF 
TRAFFIC ENVISIONED UNDER THE DRUZHBADRIA PROJECT -- AT ITS 
PEAK, 80 LARGE (250 THOUSAND PLUS TON ) TANKERS PER YEAR -- 
WILL HARDLY CHANGE.  CURRENTLY, ABOUT 50-60 TANKERS A YEAR 
DOCK AT OMISALJ (IN THE PRE-WAR YEARS IT WAS OVER A HUNDRED), 
AND OVER 400 AT TRIESTE.  THE GOVERNMENT'S ARGUMENT IS NOT 
THAT IT IS PERFECTLY SAFE -- AN IMPOSSIBLE ASSURANCE TO GIVE 
-- BUT THAT IT WOULD BE NO MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CURRENT 
SITUATION. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) THE GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH OTHER 
GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION TO UPGRADE REQUIREMENTS FOR TANKERS 
(E.G., TO REQUIRE THAT TANKERS BE DOUBLE HULLED) AND TO 
ESTABLISH TRAFFIC LANES IN THE ADRIATIC.  (CURRENTLY THERE 
ARE NO TRAFFIC LANES, ACCORDING TO THE MARITIME MINISTRY. 
WHEN WE QUIPPED "THANK GOODNESS THERE ARE NO ICEBERGS IN THE 
ADRIATIC" THE REJOINDER WAS "AH, YES, BUT WE HAVE LOTS OF 
ISLANDS.") 
 
¶9.  (SBU) CONTACTS AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND MARITIME 
MINISTRIES BELIEVE THAT A SMALL SPILL NEAR OMISALJ, PERHAPS

WHILE OFF-LOADING OR LOADING A SHIP, COULD BE EASILY 
CONTAINED BY JANAF'S MODERN EQUIPMENT.  MUCH MORE DIFFICULT 
WOULD BE A SPILL AT OPEN SEA.  IN THAT CASE, THEY CONCEDED, 
CROATIA'S RESOURCES WOULD BE OVERWHELMED, AND THEY WOULD 
REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL HELP. 
 
BALLAST WATER PROBLEM 
--------------------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU) THE BALLAST WATER PROBLEM IS NEW ONLY IN ITS SCOPE 
AND IN THE ATTENTION IT HAS DRAWN.  CURRENTLY, SHIPS THAT 
TAKE ON CROATIAN EXPORTS ARE DUMPING BALLAST WATER IN UNKNOWN 
LOCATIONS -- THERE ARE NO CONTROLS.  THE QUANTITIES ARE 
PROBABLY SMALL, AND MANY OF THESE SHIPS ARE MOVING BETWEEN 
MEDITERRANEAN PORTS, RATHER THAN BRINGING BALLAST WATERS FROM 
FARTHER AFIELD.  THUS, THE QUESTIONS RAISED OVER THE 
DRUZHBADRIA PIPELINE ARE HIGHLIGHTING A PROBLEM THAT HAS 
EXISTED FOR QUITE A WHILE, IF IN LESS DRASTIC FORM.  IDEALLY, 
BALLAST WATERS SHOULD BE EXCHANGED 200 MILES FROM SHORE -- 
WHICH MEANS NOWHERE IN THE ADRIATIC -- AND THERE ARE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WISDOM OF DOING IT IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. 
CROATIA IS LOOKING AT THIS PROBLEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL MARITIME ORGANIZATION (IMO) AND AS PART OF THE 
ADRIATIC UNION INITIATIVE. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR, JANAF FORMED AN EXPERT 
GROUP TO LOOK AT THE BALLAST WATER PROBLEM, INCLUDING MEMBERS 
FROM RESEARCH AND UNIVERSITY INSTITUTIONS, ACCORDING TO THE 
JANAF WEBSITE.  OUR GOVERNMENT CONTACTS TELL US THIS GROUP 
MET ONCE, THEN DECIDED THAT THE PROBLEM HAD TO BE ADDRESSED 
BY THE GOVERNMENT.  AN INTER-GOVERNMENTAL COMMITTEE WAS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00799  03 OF 05  110815Z 
FORMED, BUT APPARENTLY HAS YET TO MEET. 
 
¶12.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENT CONTACTS, JANAF 
TECHNICALLY DOES NOT NEED TO DO AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY 
(EIS) FOR THE DRUZHBADRIA PIPELINE, SINCE THE EXISTING 
PIPELINE AND ON- AND OFF-LOADING FACILITIES AT OMISALJ ARE 
ALREADY LICENSED FOR TRANSPORTING UP TO 30 MILLION TONS A 
YEAR.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE PIPELINE, 
THE GOVERNMENT DIRECTED JANAF TO DO AN EIS, AT JANAF'S 
EXPENSE.  THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT BELIEVES THIS WILL TAKE 
ONLY TWO TO THREE MONTHS, PLUS ANOTHER FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS 
FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.  (NOTE: PER THE SCOPE OF WORK OF A 
TDA-FINANCED FEASIBILITY STUDY OF THE CPOT PROJECT -- SEE 
PARA 16 BELOW -- THERE WILL BE AT LEAST A PARTIAL EIS DONE AS 
PART OF THAT STUDY.  WE ARE TRYING TO CLARIFY THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO STUDIES.)

DEAL.  ASSISTANT MINISTER OF ECONOMY ROMAN NOTA RECENTLY 
COMMENTED TO US, HALF SARCASTICALLY, THAT AMERICANS AND 
RUSSIANS REGULARLY VISIT HIM TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE STATUS OF 
THE DRUZHBADRIA PIPELINE PROJECT.  HOWEVER, THEY ARE NOT 
SHOWING SUPPORT FOR ANY PARTICULAR ROUTE, AND THEY ARE NOT 
COMMITTING TO PUT MONEY INTO THE PROJECT.  "IT IS NOT CLEAR 
WHO WILL FILL THE PIPELINE, AND WHO WILL BUY WHAT COMES OUT." 
 INDEED, THE AGREEMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE GUARANTEES FOR 
MINIMUM DELIVERIES. 
 
¶14.  (SBU) A FEW U.S. COMPANIES HAVE EXPRESSED PRELIMINARY 
INTEREST IN SOURCING FROM THE DRUZHBADRIA PIPELINE, BUT WERE 
DIRECTED BY THE GOC AND JANAF TO AK TRANSNEFT -- THE RUSSIAN 
ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING SUPPLIES AND BUYERS FOR THE 
OIL -- TO NEGOTIATE ANY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  THE GOC AND 
JANAF ARE ALSO NOT INTERESTED IN ANY DEAL THAT WOULD RESULT 
IN LOSING OWNERSHIP CONTROL OF ITS PIPELINE, WHICH WAS PART 
OF THE OFFER OF AT LEAST ONE OF THE INTERESTED U.S. PARTIES. 
 
¶15.  (SBU) IN THE MEANTIME, THERE ARE RISKS FOR CROATIA -- 
NAMELY ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS, AND BY EXTENSION, POLITICAL 
RISKS.  FOR CROATIA, UPGRADING ITS ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING 
AND POLLUTION CONTROLS WILL BE RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE.  NOTA 
CHARACTERIZED COOPERATION AMONG THE COUNTRIES PARTY TO THE 
AGREEMENT AS GOOD, WITH "OCCASIONAL PROBLEMS FROM UKRAINE," 
WHICH HAS A POTENTIALLY COMPETING, "INTERNAL PROJECT," I.E., 
ODESSA-BRODY.  WHILE NOTA HAS SIMILAR CONCERNS ABOUT THE CPOT 
PROJECT, IF BOTH PROJECTS WERE RUNNING CONCURRENTLY, CROATIA 
WOULD GET MORE BENEFIT WITH THE SAME RISK, HE SAID.

¶16.  (SBU) THE CONSTANTA-PANCEVO-OMISALJ-TRIESTE (CPOT) 
PIPELINE, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING CASPIAN BASIN OIL FIRST 
TO AN EXPORT TERMINAL AT OMISALJ, THEN AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION 
OF A PIPELINE TO TRIESTE, TO THE TRANS-ALPINE PIPELINE.  A 
U.S. CONSORTIUM, HLP-PARSONS, IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING A 
TDA-FINANCED TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY STUDY.  THE 
RELATIVELY MINOR UPGRADES THAT CROATIA WOULD HAVE TO MAKE FOR 
THE DRUZHBADRIA PROJECT WOULD COMPLEMENT THE POTENTIALLY 
LARGER CPOT PROJECT.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS FOR 
CROATIA REGARDING THE CPOT PROJECT.  CURRENTLY, SERBIA AND 
PARTS OF BOSNIA ARE SERVED BY OIL COMING EAST FROM OMISALJ 
AND SISAK, EITHER THROUGH PIPELINE OR TRUCK.  SHOULD A CPOT 
PIPELINE BE BUILT, CROATIA WOULD LOSE THOSE MARKETS, AS THE 
PETROLEUM WOULD FLOW WEST AND SUPPLY REFINERIES IN SERBIA AND 
BOSNIA. 
 
¶17.  (SBU) IN A MEETING WITH JANAF PRESIDENT VESNA 
TRNOKOP-TANTA AND AN ADVISOR, PROBLEMS WERE CITED WITH THE 
PARSONS STUDY.  NAMELY, JANAF FELT THAT PARSONS WAS USING 
UNREALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE 
RESULTANT USE OF ENERGY IN SERBIA AND BOSNIA.  THESE

ASSUMPTIONS INCREASED THE COST OF THE PROJECT IN TWO WAYS -- 
MORE INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD NEED TO BE BUILT IN THE EASTERN 
PART OF THE ROUTE, AND LESS OIL WOULD END UP BEING DELIVERED 
TO CROATIA AS A RESULT OF CONSUMPTION PROJECTIONS.  "IT ISN'T 
WORTH IT TO US TO LOSE OUR SERBIAN MARKETS, IF WE ONLY GET 5 
MILLION TONS OF OIL," COMPLAINED TRNOKOP.  (IN OTHER QUARTERS 
WE HAVE HEARD ESTIMATES OF 10-12 MILLION TONS PER YEAR AS THE 
MINIMUM ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE AMOUNT.)  ON THE OTHER HAND, 
MINISTRY OF ECONOMY OFFICIALS SAID THEIR DISPLEASURE WITH THE 
PARSONS STUDY WAS SIMPLY THAT PARSONS WAS USING OLD, 
INACCURATE DATA. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶18.  (SBU) WHILE BOTH PIPELINE PROJECTS COULD BE BENEFICIAL 
TO CROATIA, THERE IS LITTLE CROATIA CAN DO, AS A TRANSIT 
COUNTRY, TO BRING THE PROJECTS TO FRUITION.  IN THE MEANTIME, 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS ARE INCREASING, AND JANAF WILL BE 
LOATH TO COMPLETE EXTENSIVE INVESTMENTS , INCLUDING IN 
ENVIRONMENTAL UPGRADES, UNTIL THE PROJECTS HAVE FIRM SUPPORT 
FROM BUYERS AND SUPPLIERS.
