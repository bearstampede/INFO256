SUBJECT:  UAE RED CRESCENT BEGINS AIRLIFTS TO BAGHDAD 
 
REF: ABU DHABI 1978 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C) Heralding a new phase of UAE Red Crescent 
operations in Iraq, the UAE Air Force today 
facilitated the first of four airlifts to Baghdad 
International Airport on behalf of the Red Crescent 
Authority (RCA).  RCA Secretary General San'a Al-Kitbi 
told Econoff 5/3 that the plane carried 15 tons of 
medical equipment and medicines for seven different 
hospitals in the Baghdad area.  The four airlifts 
combined will deliver more than USD $300,000 in 
medical supplies to Iraq.  Since November 2002, the 
RCA has spent a total of USD $3,347,761 on its 
humanitarian operations in Iraq. 
 
¶3.  (C) According to Al-Kitbi, the medical airlifts 
are only the first step in what is a plan to provide 
seven hospitals located in different areas of Baghdad 
with all the medical supplies and equipment they need 
to offer both outpatient and long-term/surgical 
services.  UAE medical experts are already in Baghdad 
assisting with the complete renovation of the Olympic 
Hospital near the Iraq Ministry of Health building and 
have identified the seven hospitals to receive the RCA 
assistance.

¶4.  (U) According to press reports, the RCA delegation 
that arrived to Umm Qasr 4/11 handed over six fully 
equipped ambulances on 5/2 to the Iraqi Red Crescent 
Society.  ICRC will assist the Iraqi Red Crescent in 
the distribution of the ambulances to hospitals 
located in remote areas of southern Iraq. 
 
¶5.  (U) Post also learned that RCA coordinated 5/1 a 
convoy carrying 140 tons of food and medical aid to 
Iraq from Jordan on behalf of Human Appeal 
International -- the third largest NGO in the UAE. 
UAE Ambassador to Jordan Rahma Al-Za'abi dispatched 
the convoy from Amman earlier this week.  Ten 
representatives from the UAE branch of Human Appeal 
International accompanied the supplies to Iraq, and 
will distribute them to Al-Karekh Hospital and other 
medical centers in central Iraq.
