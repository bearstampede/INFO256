SUBJECT: NIGERIA: VETTING OF NIGERIAN BATTALIONS FOR 
LIBERIA 
 
 
REF: A. STATE 217905 
     ¶B. FREETOWN 776 
 
 
¶1.  (U) Post has requested the name of the current 
commander of the 26th Infantry battalion as well as other 
key officers in the battalion.  The Nigerian military has 
yet to respond to the request, thus we have not been able 
to vet the names of the battalion commander and his core 
officers.  However, we have checked all available records 
at Post and thus far have found no information indicating 
involvement of that battalion in any gross human rights 
violations.  We also have not found any derogatory 
information about NIBATT 15 currently deployed in Sierra 
Leone under UNAMSIL. 
 
 
¶2.  (U) Post will vet the names of the battalion commander 
and his senior officers once they have been provided by the 
GON. 
 
 
¶3.  (U) ACTION REQUEST: For Department: Please complete 
human rights vetting for these battalions as soon as possible 
and inform Embassy Abuja of findings.
