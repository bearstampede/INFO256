SUBJECT: GUATEMALA ON MIDDLE EAST RESOLUTIONS AT UNGA 
 
REF: STATE 305553 
 
PolOff discussed reftel points with Luis Carranza, Acting 
Director for Multilateral Affairs at the Foreign Ministry on 
November 6.  Carranza promised to forward our points to Vice 
Minister Aguilera and to Guatemalan Permanent Representative 
to the United Nations, Ambassador Rosenthall, for comment. 
Carranza said that Guatemala agreed in principle with our 
argument that repetitive, one-sided, and purely political 
UNGA resolutions were not helpful, and he added that his 
government's initial view of our proposals was positive, 
especially the effort to consolidate resolutions.  However, 
Carranza cautioned that Guatemala would carefully consider 
Arab positions on these issues, especially those of the 
Palestinian representative.  Carranza added that the NAM had 
yet to form a position, and Guatemala would take its views 
into consideration before mapping its own votes.
