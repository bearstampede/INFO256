NOMINATING-OFFICER: Joe Novak 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
As a civil servant Ms. Arifa has proven herself quite 
effective.  She is a very knowledgeable person that 
Mission relies on for particular information on a 
regular basis.  With her ability and dedication she can 
be expected to rise through the civil service ranks and 
eventually fill a leadership role in the Sri Lankan 
government, most likely in one of the more sensitive 
areas such as Kattankudy.  It is in the Mission's 
interest not only to establish a strong link with 
government officials in these sensitive areas, but she 
also provides a direct link to the Muslim community.
