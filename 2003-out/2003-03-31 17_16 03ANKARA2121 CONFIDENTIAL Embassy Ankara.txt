SUBJECT: RESUPPLY OF TROOPS IN NORTHERN IRAQ: REQUEST FOR 
GUIDANCE 
 
 
REF: A) STATE 81560 B)ANKARA 2063 
 
 
(u) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: 
1.5 (B and D). 
 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 6.

RESUPPLY OF US FORCES 
--------------------- 
 
 
¶2. (C) A/DCM, ECON counselor and TF-N/J4 representative met 
with MFA DDG for the Americas Suna Ilicak and DDG for 
Bilateral Economic Affairs Mehmet Gucuk March 31 to discuss 
the possibility of the USG resupplying US troops in northern 
Iraq via Turkey (refs). 
 
 
¶3. (C) Ilicak and Gucuk said they did not envision any 
problem with the USG request for US military authorities to 
contract directly with Turkish companies for the ground 
transportation of water purchased in Turkey.  On the US 
request to transport US-origin MREs, however, the MFA 
officials said they would have to take the request to their 
higher authorities for a decision. 
 
 
¶4. (C) On fuel, both Ilicak and Gucuk said that, in their 
opinion, it would be much easier for the US military to 
contract directly with Turkish firms (as opposed to going 
through the Turkish military) to procure/transport Turkish 
fuel, as well as to transport US fuel already in Turkey, to 
US forces in Iraq.  The MFA officials said the US request on 
fuel already had been relayed to the GOT policy levels for a 
decision (ODC-TGS letter dated March 28 -- ref b).  However, 
Ilicak and Gucuk cautioned if the GOT were to approve such a 
method of procurement/transportation of fuel, and the US were 
to elect to contract directly with Turkish companies, the GOT 
would have "no flexibility" on the issue of taxes (i.e., the 
USG would be required to pay taxes.) (Comment: this is not to 
say that Ilicak and Gucuk were implying that the USG would 
not/not have to pay taxes if the USG elects to work through 
gov-to-gov channels.  They simply did not comment on this. 
End comment.) 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
SECURITY FOR TURKISH VEHICLES ONCE THEY ENTER IRAQ 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
¶5. (C) The MFA officials said that the GOT would be 
responsible for ensuring the safety and security of the 
commercial vehicles while they were in Turkey.  What happened 
when the vehicles crossed the Turkish-Iraqi border was 
another matter and one of concern to the GOT. Ilicak and 
Gucuk said they envisioned three possible arrangements for 
ensuring the security/safety of the Turkish vehicles while 
they were in northern Iraq:  (1) the USG provides assurances 
(in writing) that the USG will assume responsibility once the 
vehicles cross into northern Iraq; (2) the GOT will assume 
full responsibility; or (3) the USG and GOT will share 
responsibility and develop together appropriate measures. 
The MFA officials said they did not have a preference among 
the three options; their only request was that the USG advise 
(in writing) of its intention. (Note:  our understanding here 
at post is that the US military is prepared to assume 
responsibility for the vehicles once they arrive in northern 
Iraq. end note.) 
 
 
------ 
ACTION 
------ 
 
 
¶6. (C) In the event the GOT approves our request to contract 
via commercial means the procurement and transportation of 
fuel to US forces in northern Iraq, we will have to address 
head-on the question of whether the US is willing to pay 
taxes on official purchases.  The Embassy therefore requests 
guidance (if possible NLT OOB Ankara April 1) on how to 
proceed on this tax issue.  Unless instructed otherwise, the 
Embassy/TF-N intend to notify the MFA in writing that the US 
military intends to assume responsibility for the security of 
Turkish vehicles transporting supplies for US troops once 
they enter northern Iraq.
