On June 16, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) denied Rios 
Montt's appeal for a review of the TSE's June 12 split 
decision against the legality of his Presidential candidacy. 
TSE President Bolanos told reporters that the widely expected 
 
SIPDIS 
decision was based on Article 186 of the constitution.  The 
FRG announced that it will file an appeal with the Supreme 
Court.  Any decision by the Supreme Court, either for or 
against, is expected to ultimately be appealed to the 
Constitutional Court for final resolution.  Parties have 
until September 9 to register their candidates, giving the 
FRG sufficient time for the appeal process to run its course.
