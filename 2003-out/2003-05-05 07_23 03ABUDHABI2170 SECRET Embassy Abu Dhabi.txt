SUBJECT:  ADNAN PACHACHI IS BAGHDAD BOUND 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (S) Former Iraqi foreign minister Adnan Pachachi 
contacted the Ambassador over the local weekend 
with the news that he will be flying into Baghdad 
on Tuesday, May 6 aboard a UAE Air Force C-130 with 
a small group of his supporters.  MFA Minstate 
Hamdan bin Zayid and Armed Forces Chief of Staff 
Shaykh Muhammad bin Zayid separately told the 
Ambassador that the UAEG is supporting the 
establishment of an office for Pachachi in Baghdad 
and providing him with security, until he has set- 
up his own Iraqi security detail. 
 
¶3. (S) Comment:  Pachachi believes he has much to 
contribute in the evolving dialogue on the future 
Iraqi government.  The octogenarian statesman has 
spent the last several weeks touring various Arab 
capitals briefing leaders, including Hosni Mubarak 
and King Abdullah, on his vision, and soliciting 
their advice.  Here in Abu Dhabi, where he has 
resided with his wife since the early 1970s, 
Pachachi has been hosting informal diwans where 
Iraqi expats of all stripes have been airing their 
concerns about the current state of affairs and 
presenting suggestions on how to shape the new 
government.  For the Emiratis, Pachachi's 
moderation, his message of inclusion and his strong 
pan-Arab credentials are an important balance to 
what they view as the alarming emergence of Shi'a 
sectarianism coupled with signs of Iranian meddling 
in Iraqi affairs.  End Comment.
