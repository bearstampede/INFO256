¶1.  (C)  MFA CARIBBEAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR MONS. GIORGIO LINGUA 
TOLD US MARCH 28 THAT THE HOLY SEE STILL HOPED THAT THE MARCH 
8 OPENING OF THE BRIGITTINE SISTERS' HOUSE IN HAVANA, 
DEVELOPED WITH CASTRO'S COOPERATION, WOULD HELP PAVE THE WAY 
TO GREATER CHURCH ACCESS TO THE CUBAN PEOPLE.  THE HOLY SEE 
REGRETTED CASTRO'S TURNING THE OPENING CEREMONY INTO A 
PROPAGANDA OPPORTUNITY, BUT IS WILLING TO GRIT ITS TEETH FOR 
THE TIME BEING.  THE HOLY SEE WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT 
CARDINAL ORTEGA'S STRONG PASTORAL LETTER OF FEBRUARY 24 AND 
THE CUBAN BISHOPS' LETTER OF MARCH 11 REACTING AGAINST THE 
CASTRO GOVERNMENT'S PROPAGANDA USE OF THE BRIGITTINE SISTERS 
(REFTEL).  LINGUA BELIEVED THAT BRIGITTINE MOTHER TEKLA, 
CARDINAL SEPE, AND THE HOLY SEE ITSELF HAD MISPLAYED THE 
BRIGITTINE CONVENT OPENING, NOT JUST BY LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN 
FOR CASTRO TO PROPAGANDIZE, BUT ALSO BY EXERCISING POOR 
COORDINATION AND JUDGMENT IN THEIR PUBLIC ACTIVITIES.  MOTHER 
TEKLA HERSELF TOLD US THAT NO SPECIAL HONORS WERE ACCORDED 
CASTRO AT THE OPENING CEREMONY, AND THAT SHE INVITED HIM TO 
THE INAUGURATION OUT OF "CHARITY" AND CHRISTIAN COURTESY, 
GIVEN THAT HE HAD BOTH PERMITTED AND EXPEDITED THE PROJECT. 
NOTING THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED THREATENING LETTERS FROM "MIAMI 
CUBANS," SHE EMPHASIZED HER DESIRE TO STAY OUT OF POLITICS, 
EXPAND THE BRIGITTINE PRESENCE INTO THE POORER PROVINCES, AND 
CONTINUE TO OPEN DOORS TO ANY IN CUBA WHO CARE TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF HER SANCTUARY FOR REFLECTION, PRAYER AND 
RENEWAL.  END SUMMARY.

¶2. (C) EMBASSY MET WITH MFA CUBAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR MONS. 
GIORGIO LINGUA MARCH 21, TO GET HIS TAKE ON THE APPARENT 
DIVISIONS BETWEEN CUBAN CARDINAL ORTEGA AND BRIGITTINE MOTHER 
TEKLA, SIGNALED IN THE CUBAN BISHOPS' LETTER "CLARIFYING" 
THAT THE CUBAN CHURCH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH CASTRO'S 
APPEARANCE AT THE MARCH 8 OPENING OF THE BRIGITTINE SISTERS' 
HOUSE AND CARDINAL ORTEGA'S EARLIER PASTORAL LETTER 
EMPHASIZING THAT THERE IS NO REAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CUBA 
(REFTEL).  THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE OPENING OF THE BRIGITTINE 
HOUSE HAD BEEN REPORTED IN  VATICAN-RELATED PRESS SHORTLY 
AFTER THE BISHOPS ISSUED THEIR MARCH 11 LETTER.  LINGUA TOLD 
US THE HOLY SEE STILL HOPED THE OPENING OF THE BRIGITTINE 
SISTERS' HOUSE IN HAVANA WOULD HELP PAVE THE WAY TO GREATER 
CHURCH ACCESS IN CUBA, THUS THE HOLY SEE WAS WILLING TO GRIT 
ITS TEETH AND ACCEPT CASTRO'S PROPAGANDIZING OF THE OPENING 
CEREMONY. 
 
3.(C) SEEKING TO DAMPEN THE DIFFERENCES THAT AROSE BETWEEN 
ORTEGA AND BRIGITTINE MOTHER TEKLA OVER CASTRO'S EFFORTS TO 
CAPITALIZE ON THE CONVENT'S OPENING, LINGUA INSISTED THAT 
TEKLA AND CARDINAL SEPE, WHO ATTENDED THE OPENING, 
REPRESENTED ONLY THEMSELVES -- NOT THE HOLY SEE.  LINGUA 
UNDERSCORED THAT CARDINAL SEPE, WHO HEADS THE VATICAN 
CONGREGATION FOR EVANGELIZATION, WAS NOT A PAPAL ENVOY SENT 
TO COMMEMORATE THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE POPE'S CUBA TRIP 
(AS CASTRO REPORTEDLY SAID TO THE TV CAMERAS).  LINGUA AGREED 
THAT CARDINAL ORTEGA AND THE CUBAN CLERGY HAD A LEGITIMATE 
BEEF WITH HOW MOTHER TEKLA HAD ORGANIZED THE CONSTRUCTION AND 
INAUGURATION OF HER CONVENT (I.E. VIA DIRECT COMMUNICATION 
WITH CASTRO AND THE POPE RATHER THAN VIA THE CUBAN BISHOPS). 
HE ADMITTED THAT THE HOLY SEE HAD NOT MANAGED THE EVENT WELL, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  01401  01 OF 03  021115Z 
NOTING THAT MOTHER TEKLA "IS NOT CONTROLLABLE" AND THAT 
CARDINAL SEPE HAD TRAVELED TO THE OPENING AND OFFERED REMARKS 
WITHOUT CLEARING EITHER THE TRAVEL OR THE REMARKS WITH THE 
SECRETARIAT OF STATE.  LINGUA ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE 
 
SIPDIS 
SECRETARIAT'S CONCERN AT THE ACTIVITIES OF MEXICAN CARDINAL 
 
SIPDIS 
SANDOVAL DURING THE WEEK OF THE CONVENT OPENING, IN 
PARTICULAR SANDOVAL'S ILL-CONSIDERED PUBLIC VISIT TO AND 
POSITIVE COMMENTS AT A CLINIC WHERE THE CUBAN CHURCH HAD FOR 
YEARS BEEN SEEKING PERMISSION TO MINISTER, WITHOUT SUCCESS.

¶4. (C) TO HEAR THE BRIGITTINE SIDE OF THE STORY, EMBASSY 
OFFICERS MET MARCH 20 WITH MOTHER TEKLA FAMIGLIETTI, ABBESS 
GENERAL OF THE BRIGITTINE SISTERS, TO DISCUSS HER VISIT TO 
CUBA TO OPEN THE CONVENT IN HAVANA.  SHE AFFIRMED THAT THE 
PROJECT ORIGINATED DURING HER VISIT TO MEXICO, WHICH 
COINCIDED WITH CASTRO'S PARTICIPATION IN THE INAUGURATION OF

PRESIDENT FOX.  AFTER MEXICAN CARDINAL SANDOVAL INTRODUCED 
HER TO CASTRO, A SERIES OF CIRCUMSTANCES LED TO CASTRO 
WRITING TO POPE JOHN PAUL II TO ASK FOR HIS BLESSING ON 
MOTHER TEKLA'S PLANS TO OPEN A CONVENT IN CUBA, WHICH WAS 
RECEIVED.  WHILE CARDINAL ORTEGA GAVE HIS OWN PERMISSION FOR 
THE ORDER TO ESTABLISH ITS PRESENCE IN HIS DIOCESE, MOTHER 
TEKLA TOLD US THE CARDINAL DID NOT ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE 
PROJECT.  BECAUSE ORTEGA COULD OFFER THE CONVENT ONLY A 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  01401  02 OF 03  021115Z 
COUNTRY PROPERTY "MILES OUTSIDE OF HAVANA," TEKLA TOLD US SHE 
TURNED TO CASTRO, AND CUBA'S COMMUNIST PARTY GAVE HER THE 
CONVENT BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN HAVANA.  FIDEL CASTRO PERSONALLY 
INTERVENED TO ENSURE THAT THE BUILDING'S RENOVATION AND 
INAUGURATION PROCEEDED WITHOUT ANY OF THE NORMAL BUREAUCRATIC 
OBSTACLES, SHE SAID, IN ORDER TO HAVE IT READY FOR THE 
"ANNIVERSARY OF THE POPE'S VISIT."  THE RENOVATION COSTS WERE 
COVERED BY DONATIONS SOLICITED BY MOTHER TEKLA'S ORDER, AND 
THE VATICAN'S NUNCIATURE ASSISTED WITH IMPORTING BUILDING 
MATERIALS AND FITTINGS USUALLY HARD TO COME BY IN CUBA. 
 
¶5. (C) CUBAN CATHOLIC CHURCH OFFICIALS WERE CLEARLY MIFFED AT 
MOTHER TEKLA'S OUT-OF-CHANNELS APPROACH TO CASTRO AND THE 
POPE, AND ESPECIALLY THE PROPAGANDA OPPORTUNITY IT AFFORDED 
CASTRO, AND DID NOT ATTEND THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY DURING 
WHICH THE CUBAN LEADER FEATURED PROMINENTLY.  MOTHER TEKLA 
STRESSED THAT, CONTRARY TO MEDIA REPORTS, SHE ACCORDED NO 
SPECIAL HONORS TO CASTRO, AND THAT SHE INVITED HIM TO THE 
INAUGURATION OUT OF CHARITY AND "CHRISTIAN COURTESY," GIVEN 
THAT HE HAD EXPEDITED THE PROJECT.  SHE TOLD US SHE GAVE HIM 
ONE OF HER OWN ORDER'S MEDALS FOR HIS EFFORT "TO SUPPORT 
ECUMENISM" ONLY IN RESPONSE TO THE VARELA MEDAL CASTRO HAD 
OFFERED HER.  SHE INSISTED THAT NEITHER GIFT MEANT MUCH MORE 
THAN SIMPLE COURTESY, AND UNDERSCORED THAT THE BRIGITTINE 
MEDAL IS NOT AN OFFICIAL HOLY SEE RECOGNITION. 
 
¶6. (C) MOTHER TEKLA ASSURED US THAT HER ORDER IS NOT IN CUBA 
FOR POLITICAL REASONS.  IN FACT, SHE SAID THE CHURCH SHOULD 
STAY OUT OF POLITICS AND INSISTED THAT CHRISTIAN CHARITY WAS 
THE SOLE MOTIVE FOR HER ORDER'S PRESENCE IN CUBA.  SHE SAID 
THE CONVENT SEEKS TO PROMOTE PEACE AND JUSTICE THROUGH 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  01401  02 OF 03  021115Z 
REFLECTION, AND CUBANS HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMING FOR RELIGIOUS 
INSTRUCTION, BAPTISM, AND TO RECEIVE BIBLES.  MOTHER TEKLA 
ALSO NOTED THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAVE ALSO 
CONTACTED THE CONVENT.  THE ORDER HOPES TO OPEN ANOTHER 
CENTER IN CUBA, PREFERABLY IN A POOR AREA OF THE COUNTRY 
OUTSIDE OF HAVANA.  HOWEVER, SHE SAID HAVANA'S CARDINAL 
ORTEGA HAS HER SISTERS UNDER FIRM CONTROL AND HINTED THAT THE 
CARDINAL MIGHT OBSTRUCT HER ORDER'S EXPANSION. 
 
¶7. (C)  MOTHER TEKLA TOLD US THAT PRIOR TO HER VISIT TO CUBA 
SHE HAD RECEIVED "THREATENING LETTERS" FROM CUBAN MIGRS IN 
MIAMI WHICH, SHE SAID, WERE AIMED AT DEMORALIZING HER.  SHE 
REGRETTED THE FACT THAT THE PUBLIC CIRCUS SURROUNDING THE 
OPENING OF HER HOUSE HAD CAUSED A RIFT BETWEEN ORTEGA AND HER 
SISTERS, AND BY "POLITICIZING" THE EVENT APPARENTLY 
STIMULATED PEOPLE TO SEND THE LETTERS.

¶8. (C) THE HOLY SEE IS CLEARLY EMBARRASSED AT HOW POORLY THEY 
MANAGED THIS AFFAIR.  NEVER AN INSTITUTION TO MAKE A BOLD 
DIPLOMATIC GESTURE, AS MONS. LINGUA HAS TOLD US MANY TIMES, 
THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE IS NERVOUS ABOUT A POSSIBLE 
CRACKDOWN ON THE LIMITED RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS THE CUBAN CHURCH 
GAINED AFTER THE POPE'S 1998 VISIT TO THE ISLAND.  HE SAID 
THEY NEVERTHELESS PLACED MUCH HOPE IN THE BRIGITTINE CONVENT 
SETTING A PRECEDENT TO OPEN THE WAY FOR THE MANY OTHER 
PENDING REQUESTS OF RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES TO GAIN ACCESS TO 
CUBA.  WE BELIEVE THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENING HERE TOO. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  01401  02 OF 03  021115Z 
 MOTHER TEKLA IS REPUTED TO HAVE A DIRECT CONNECTION TO POPE 
JOHN PAUL II, WHO HIMSELF IS KNOWN TO MAKE THE OCCASIONAL 
BOLD GESTURE.  CARDINAL SEPE IS A FAVORED SON, WHO WAS 
ELEVATED TO CARDINAL AND MADE PRESIDENT OF THE PONTIFICAL 
CONGREGATION FOR THE EVANGELIZATION OF PEOPLE (THE OLDEST AND 
SOME SAY MOST POWERFUL DICASTRY) IN 2001, IN PART FOR HIS 
GOOD WORK ORGANIZING THE 2000 JUBILEE YEAR -- A CHERISHED 
PROJECT OF JOHN PAUL II.  WE FIND IT IMPLAUSIBLE THAT SEPE 
ATTENDED THIS EVENT ONLY AS A "FRIEND OF MOTHER TEKLA."  IT 
SEEMS MORE LIKELY THAT THE POPE HIMSELF PUT GREAT STORE IN 
THE OPENING OF THE BRIGITTINE CONVENT (WHICH WAS REFLECTED IN 
THE MANY FULL PAGES OF COVERAGE IT RECEIVED IN OSSERVATORE 
ROMANO -- THE VATICAN OFFICIAL NEWS DAILY).  IN THIS CONTEXT, 
WE BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE POPE WISHED TO USE THE 
OPENING OF THE CONVENT TO HELP PRY OPEN THE DOORS TO GREATER 
RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES IN SUCH AS WAY THAT THE CUBAN CLERGY 
ITSELF WAS PROTECTED FROM ANY BACKLASH. 
 
¶9.  (C) WE LEAVE TO USINT TO ASSESS WHETHER THE CONVENT 
OPENING WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO GREATER RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN 
CUBA AND WHETHER THE EVENT HAS OR HAS NOT CREATED LASTING
