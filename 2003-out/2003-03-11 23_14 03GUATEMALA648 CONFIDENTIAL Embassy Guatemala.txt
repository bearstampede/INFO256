E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2013 
TAGS: PREL IZ GT UNSC
SUBJECT: GUATEMALA NOT LIKELY TO ASSIST ON IRAQ RESOLUTION 
 
REF: A. STATE 63629 
     ¶B. GUATEMALA 370 
 
Classified By: Rob Copley for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (C) Although the GOG has informally indicated support for 
Iraq's unconditional need to comply with UNSCR 1441, it has 
remained non-committal on US/UK/Spanish resolution on Iraq. 
Were we to press Guatemala we believe it might play an 
unhelpful role.  We therefore did not urge GOG participation 
in the Security Council session mentioned in Ref A. 
 
¶2.  (C) Ambassador Hamilton discussed Secretary Powell's UNSC 
presentation of the case against Iraq with then-Acting 
President Reyes on February 6 (Ref B).  In that meeting Reyes 
chose not comment substantively on the GOG's position on 
Iraq.  The DCM twice raised the issue of Iraqi non-compliance 
with Foreign Minister Edgar Gutierrez after the February 7 
and 14 presentations by Secretary Powell to the U.N. Security 
Council.  On both occasions Gutierrez expressed appreciation 
for translated transcripts of the Secretary's presentations 
but studiously avoided any comment as to GOG policy towards 
Iraq.
