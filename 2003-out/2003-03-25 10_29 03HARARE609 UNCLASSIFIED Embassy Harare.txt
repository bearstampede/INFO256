  ¶1.   Under headline "Bush, Blair are villains" the 
      government-controlled daily Chronicle" called 
      for broadcast of "more gory pictures of 
      mutilated British and American soldiers on our 
      television screens," in its March 25 editorial. 
      Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .We wish to see more gory pictures of 
      mutilated British and American soldiers on our 
      television screens.  This will serve as a lesson to 
      those who believe that they can control the world and 
      bully everybody.  It is disappointing that the world 
      has stood by and let George Bush and his partner in 
      crime, Tony Blair, kill innocent civilians under the 
      guise of promoting democracy. . .  We will not support 
      the bullying of smaller nations by those who believe 
      that they can police the world. . .  We are relieved 
      that there are reports that the U.S.-led forces face 
      fiercer-than-expected resistance, quashing hopes of a 
      swift victory. . .  We urge the immediate resignation 
      of Tony Blair and George bush for crimes of war and 
      crimes against humanity." 
 
  ¶3.   Comment: This editorial, truly sick even by the 
      Chronicle's notoriously low standards, contrast 
      harshly to the Zimbabwean information minister's 
      locally ballyhooed March 24 complaint that western 
      media coverage of Iraq abuses ethical and audience 
      standards by showing violent images.
