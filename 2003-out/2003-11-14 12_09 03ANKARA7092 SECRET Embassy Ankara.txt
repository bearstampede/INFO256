¶1. (S) On November 14, MFA Intelligence and Research 
Department Head Ahmet Yildiz handed PolMilOff the following 
non-paper: 
 
 
Begin text: 
 
 
It has been reported that two members of PKK/KADEK terrorist 
organization, Sefin (born in 1966 in Syria) and Davut Felat 
(a Turkish national, born 1970 in Diyarbakir) surrendered to 
the Kurdistan Democratic Party's (KDP) peshmergas in Atrush 
on 01 November 2003.  However, upon the PKK/KADEK's request 
the aforementioned persons were handed over to the terrorist 
organization in Mount Gara area on 02 November 2003. 
 
 
After a full evaluation of the situation, it is concluded 
that the attitude of KDP was aimed to block the 
implementation of the Law on Reintegration into Society by 
obstructing the members of the terrorist organization from 
surrendering, contrary to the joint efforts by US and Turkey 
to encourage the terrorists to give up their arms and resume 
their everyday lives, and also reinvigorate and maintain 
social peace and stability in the region.

¶2. (S) RECOMMENDATION: Post recommends Washington and CPA 
raise this case with senior KDP officials and seek a 
commitment that any PKK/KADEK/KHK member surrendering to the 
KDP will be turned over to Turkish forces for processing 
under Turkey's Reintegration Law.
