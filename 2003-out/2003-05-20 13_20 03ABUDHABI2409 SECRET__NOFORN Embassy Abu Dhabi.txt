SUBJECT: (S)  TERRORIST FINANCING:  REQUEST 
FOR RELEASABLE INTEL PACKAGE ON HUMAN APPEAL 
INTERNATIONAL 
 
REF:  STATE 133205 
 
¶1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE RICHARD ALBRIGHT 
FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶2.  (S/NF) Because of the sensitivities 
associated with Human Appeal International 
(HAI), we have requested an appointment with 
de facto Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamdan Bin 
Zayid to deliver reftel points.  Hamdan, our 
primary leadership-level contact on terrorist 
financing issues, is currently traveling 
outside the UAE. 
 
¶3.  (S/NF)  However, in anticipation of his 
likely response to our demarche, we would 
appreciate receiving (via ORCA channels if 
necessary) a releasable intel package which we 
may provide to the UAEG in support of our 
request that they crack down on Human Appeal. 
The information on Ayoub Ali and Boudella Al- 
Haj is specific and compelling, but we have 
no/no direct supporting information with 
regard to HAI's funding of Hamas.  If we want 
the UAEG to block HAI funding of Hamas, it 
would be helpful to give them evidence that 
such funding has occurred in the past and is 
continuing, including the specific 
entities/accounts belonging to Hamas into 
which HAI funds are flowing.  Similarly, 
details with regard to the Al-Rashid Trust's 
continuing operations in the UAE would be most 
helpful.  We note that the UAE Central Bank 
has already ordered financial institutions 
here -- at our request -- to freeze any 
accounts associated with the Al-Rashid Trust. 
 
¶4.  (S/NF)  When we went to the UAE to request 
their partnership with us in closing Al- 
Barakat operations here we were able to submit 
to them a lengthy intel package outlining the 
reasons why we believed that organization was 
involved in terrorist financing.  A similar 
package on HAI will demonstrate that we are 
motivated by solid fact and that we are 
serious about having the UAEG take appropriate 
action to block HAI funding of terrorist 
groups.  A strong intel package should give 
the Emirati authorities the compelling 
information they will need to intiate their 
own investigation and take the necessary steps 
to ensure HAI is not funding -- wittingly or 
unwittingly -- terrorist groups.
