29TH SESSION 
 
REF: A) ROME 1380   B) ROME 1685 
 
¶1. SUMMARY. THE UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION 
(FAO) COMMITTEE ON WORLD FOOD SECURITY (CFS) WILL MEET 
MAY 12-16 IN ITS FIRST SESSION AFTER THE "WORLD FOOD 
SUMMIT:FIVE YEARS LATER" RECONFIRMED ITS MANDATE TO 
MONITOR PROGRESS TOWARDS REACHING THE GOAL OF HALVING 
WORLD HUNGER BY 2015.  THE CFS WILL CONSIDER FAO'S "ANTI- 
HUNGER PROGRAM" -- A USD 24 BILLION/YEAR PROPOSAL TO "GET 
COUNTRIES ON TRACK TOWARDS MEETING WORLD FOOD SUMMIT 
GOALS"-- AND FAO'S PROPOSAL TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE 
"INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE AGAINST HUNGER."  THE CFS MEETING 
PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE UNITED STATES TO WORK WITH 
OTHER COUNTRIES TO IMPROVE CFS MONITORING AND TO 
HIGHLIGHT THE U.S.'S OWN "ANTI-HUNGER" INITIATIVES.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
OPENING OF THE SESSION, BUREAU 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  THE 29TH SESSION OF THE CFS WILL MEET MAY 12-16, 2003 
IN ITS FIRST SESSION AFTER THE 2002 WORLD FOOD 
SUMMIT:FIVE YEARS LATER MEETING (WFS5YL) RECONFIRMED ITS 
MANDATE TO MONITOR PROGRESS TOWARDS REACHING THE GOAL OF 
HALVING WORLD HUNGER BY 2015. THE CFS BUREAU SERVES FOR 
TWO SESSIONS.  THE CHAIR (THAILAND) AND VICE-CHAIRS 
(FRANCE, REPUBLIC OF KOREA, EGYPT AND SOUTH AFRICA) WILL 
SERVE THROUGH THIS YEAR'S SESSION.  THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC WILL OPEN THE SESSION.  FAO DIRECTOR 
GENERAL JACQUES DIOUF WILL ATTEND THE FIRST DAY.  THE 
U.S. WILL REPRESENT NORTH AMERICA ON THE DRAFTING 
COMMITTEE. 
 
ITEM II.  FAO DISTINGUISHED LECTURE ON FOOD SECURITY 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
¶3. FORMER IMF DIRECTOR MICHEL CAMDESSUS WILL PRESENT THE 
LECTURE. 
 
ITEM III. ASSESSMENT OF THE WORLD FOOD SECURITY SITUATION 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
¶4.  THE FAO ASSESSMENT PRESENTS A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE 
CURRENT WORLD FOOD SECURITY SITUATION. 
 
¶5. CURRENT SITUATION: THE DOCUMENT STATES THAT THE NUMBER 
OF UNDERNOURISHED IS NOW ESTIMATED AT 840 MILLION, A 
DECREASE OF BARELY 2.5 MILLION OVER THE LAST 7 YEARS, AND 
FAR BELOW THE 22 MILLION A YEAR REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE 
WORLD FOOD SUMMIT (WFS) GOAL OF HALVING THE NUMBER OF 
HUNGRY BY 2015. OUT OF A TOTAL OF 96 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
FOR WHICH COMPARABLE DATA EXISTS, THE FAO CONSIDERS THAT 
24 COUNTRIES ARE "ON TRACK" TO ACHIEVING THE WFS TARGET, 
6 ARE "LAGGING BEHIND" AND 44 COUNTRIES ARE "OFF TRACK." 
OUTSIDE OF ASIA AND EASTERN EUROPE, GROWTH RATES IN MOST 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE "TOO LOW TO GENERATE A MARKED 
EFFECT ON POVERTY REDUCTION." 
 
¶6.  HUNGER HOT SPOTS: 38 COUNTRIES, MOST OF THEM (25) IN 
AFRICA, ARE EXPERIENCING SERIOUS FOOD SHORTAGES. 
 
¶7.  FOOD AID REQUIREMENTS: THE WFP FIGURE OF USD 3 
BILLION FOR 2003 IS CITED. 
 
¶8.  AVAILABILITY AND STABILITY OF SUPPLY:  THE REPORT 
NOTES LAST YEAR'S DECLINE IN CEREAL PRODUCTION, WITH 
PRODUCTION OF OTHER BASIC FOODS UNCHANGED OR SHOWING 
MODEST INCREASES. 
 
¶9.  FOOD IMPORT BILLS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TRENDED 
DOWN DUE TO FALLING INTERNATIONAL PRICES FROM MID-90'S TO 
¶2001.  THE VOLUME OF FOOD IMPORTS BY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
ROSE SUBSTANTIALLY DURING THE SAME PERIOD.  STARTING IN 
2002, THE IMPORT BILL INCREASED BY OVER 6 PERCENT (IN 
NOMINAL TERMS), MOSTLY DUE TO RISING INTERNATIONAL PRICES 
FOR WHEAT, COARSE GRAINS, OILS, FATS AND OILSEEDS.  THE 
REPORT CONCLUDES THAT "IF RECENT INTERNATIONAL COMMODITY 
PRICES INCREASES ARE SUSTAINED IN 2003, AND TRANSMITTED 
TO INTERNAL MARKET PRICES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE 
DEMAND FOR FOOD IMPORTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES WILL BE 
AFFECTED NEGATIVELY." 
 
¶10. ACCESS TO FOOD - FOCUS ON TRADE:  THE ACCESS TO FOOD 
SECTION FOCUSES ON THE POTENTIAL OF TRADE TO CONTRIBUTE

29TH SESSION 
 
TO OVERALL ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL GROWTH AND THE 
REDUCTION OF FOOD INSECURITY.  IT NOTES THAT THE BENEFITS 
FROM FREER TRADE DO NOT COME AUTOMATICALLY, AND 
HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF ASSISTING DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES TO IMPROVE THEIR CAPACITY TO COMPLY WITH 
INTERNATIONAL FOOD SAFETY STANDARDS AS WELL AS TO 
PARTICIPATE IN AGRICULTURAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. 
 
¶11.  IN THE CONTEXT OF FOOD SAFETY, THE DOCUMENT NOTES 
THREE INITIATIVES:  FAO'S "STRATEGY TOWARDS A FOOD CHAIN 
APPROACH TO FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY "; THE NEWLY 
ESTABLISHED WHO/FAO CODEX ALIMENTARIUS TRUST FUND AND THE 
INTEREST IN HOLDING A SECOND GLOBAL FORUM OF FOOD SAFETY 
REGULATORS.  THE DOCUMENT NOTES THAT A PREPARATORY 
MEETING ON THE SECOND GLOBAL FORUM WILL BE HELD IN JULY 
2003 TO FINALIZE THE ARRANGEMENTS. 
 
¶12.  COMMENT: THE LAST CFS SESSION REQUESTED THAT THE FAO 
PROVIDE A "DRAFT FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT OUTLINING FAO'S 
STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS KEY ELEMENTS OF POLICY ADVICE, 
CAPACITY BUILDING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND ACTIONS 
THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL 
LEVELS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD." THE 
RESULTING DOCUMENT, FAO'S "STRATEGY ON A FOOD CHAIN 
APPROACH TO FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY" AROUSED STRONG 
OBJECTIONS FROM CAIRNS GROUP COUNTRIES (AND THE U.S.) AT 
THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE (REFTEL 
B), NOT LEAST BECAUSE THE FAO HAD ADDED "QUALITY" TO THE 
FRAMEWORK.  WE EXPECT CAIRNS GROUP COUNTRIES TO RAISE 
THOSE CONCERNS AGAIN (AS SHOULD THE U.S.). USDEL SHOULD 
ALSO COMMENT ON THE PROPOSED SECOND GLOBAL FORUM OF FOOD 
SAFETY REGULATORS. END COMMENT. 
 
ITEM IV. REPORT ON THE FIRST INTERGOVERNMENTAL WORKING 
GROUP (IGWG): VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD 
IN THE CONTEXT OF NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶13.  THE CFS WILL HEAR A REPORT OF THE IGWG'S FIRST 
MEETING IN MARCH 2003.  WE DO NOT EXPECT SUBSTANTIVE 
DISCUSSION. (SEE REFTEL A REPORTING CABLE ON THE IGWG). 
ITEM V.  RECENT FAO INITIATIVES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST 
HUNGER: ANTI-HUNGER PROGRAM; INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE 
AGAINST HUNGER 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶14.  THE CFS WILL BE ASKED TO "ENDORSE" THE FAO'S "ANTI- 
HUNGER PROGRAM," FIRST UNVEILED AT THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT 
FIVE YEARS LATER (WFS5YL) AND REVISED FOR THE WORLD 
SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (WSSD).  THE FAO "ANTI- 
HUNGER PROGRAM" ESTIMATES AN ANNUAL NEED FOR PUBLIC 
INVESTMENT ON THE ORDER OF USD 24 BILLION (EVENLY 
FINANCED BETWEEN DONORS AND RECIPIENTS, ACCORDING TO THE 
FAO) TO "BRING HUNGER REDUCTION BACK ON TRACK."  THE 
PUBLIC INVESTMENT "PACKAGE" POSITS THE NEED FOR USD 5 
BILLION FOR DIRECT TRANSFERS TO THE UNDERNOURISHED AND 
USD 19 BILLION FOR ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF 
UNDERNOURISHMENT AND RURAL POVERTY THROUGH AGRICULTURAL 
GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENT IN RURAL AREAS.  FAO 
ALSO INTENDS TO RE-NAME THE PROGRAM "THE ANTI-HUNGER 
PROGRAM IN SUPPORT OF THE UN MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT 
GOALS."  FAO REITERATED THAT THE PROGRAM IS A 
"PROGRAMMATIC CALL TO ACTION BY ALL STAKEHOLDERS" AND 
THAT THE FAO DOES NOT SEEK A NEW ROLE OR NEW RESOURCES. 
 
¶15.  COMMENT:  CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER OECD MEMBERS ON 
THE "ANTI-HUNGER PROGRAM" HAVE SHOWN THAT MEMBERS ARE 
CONCERNED THAT ENDORSEMENT OF THE PROGRAM MAY IMPLY 
CONSENT EITHER TO THE USD 24 BILLION "PRICE TAG" OR TO A 
COMMITMENT TO FUND PART OF THE ANTI-HUNGER PROGRAM. END 
COMMENT. 
 
¶16. UNDER "FAO INITIATIVES," THE CFS WILL ALSO BE ASKED 
TO ENDORSE THE "AIMS, GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND ACTIVITIES" 
OF THE INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE AGAINST HUNGER (IAAH).  THE 
CFS SHOULD ADVISE ON FREQUENCY OF MEETINGS, AND INDICATE 
FUNDING OPTIONS (THE DOCUMENT INDICATE THAT THERE IS A 
NEED FOR RESOURCES TO ESTABLISH AND OPERATE THE IAAH). 
THE IAAH, FIRST DISCUSSED AT THE WFS5YL, WOULD BUILD UPON 
EXISTING INITIATIVES AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND

INTERNATIONAL LEVELS.  THE EXISTENCE OF THE IAAH WOULD 
"PROVIDE INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR NATIONAL 
INITIATIVES AS PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL PROCESS OF 
WORKING TOWARD THE WFS GOAL." THE IAAH WOULD LINK 
TOGETHER STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS (INCLUDING NGO'S AND 
THE PRIVATE SECTOR) IN EFFORTS TO MEET THE WFS GOALS.

MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF DISASTERS AND DISCUSSES THE 
POTENTIAL OF AQUACULTURE FOR IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY. 
 
VIII.  OTHER MATTERS -- THEMES FOR NEXT SESSION 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶18.  UNDER "OTHER MATTERS" MEMBERS WILL BE ASKED TO 
COMMENT ON THE PROPOSED THEMES FOR THE NEXT SESSION AND 
IDENTIFY ONE FOR THE NEXT SESSION.  THE PROPOSED THEMES 
ARE: 
 
¶A. AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COSTS OF HUNGER; 
¶B. CROP AND INCOME DIVERSIFICATION - IMPLICATIONS FOR 
SMALLHOLDER PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AND FOOD SECURITY; 
¶C. BEST PRACTICES IN REDUCING RURAL POVERTY AND FOOD 
INSECURITY IN MARGINAL LANDS - LESSONS FROM SUCCESSFUL 
EXPERIENCES IN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES AND 
ECONOMIC POLICIES IN SELECTED COUNTRIES; 
¶D. AGRICULTURAL BIODIVERSITY: THE IMPORTANCE SMALL FARMER 
IN-SITU CONSERVATION OF PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES; 
¶E. IMPLICATIONS OF GMO'S FOR FOOD SECURITY AND FOOD 
SAFETY. 
 
¶19. COMMENT:  MISSION RECOMMENDS C AS THE BEST THEME, 
WITH B AND D ACCEPTABLE.  WE WOULD NOT SUPPORT A OR E. 
MISSION ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT AMONG THE THEMES FOR NEXT 
YEAR'S SELECTION BE ONE ON HIV/AIDS AND ITS IMPACT ON 
FOOD SECURITY. 
 
INFORMATION DOCUMENTS -- COST OF WFS5YL 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶20.  A DOCUMENT ON THE COST OF THE WFS5YL IS INCLUDED IN 
THE INFORMATION DOCUMENTS.  ACCORDING TO THE FAO 
CALCULATIONS, THE WFS5YL CONSUMED SOME USD 2 MILLION IN 
REGULAR BUDGET RESOURCES OF WHICH USD 463,000 WERE 
"DIRECT INCREMENTAL COSTS" AND USD 1,46 MILLION WERE 
"REDIRECTED" FROM DIVISIONS FROM WITHIN EXISTING 
ALLOTMENTS.  ANOTHER USD 2 MILLION WAS PROVIDED BY 
VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM GOVERNMENTS AND THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR. 
 
INFORMAL PANEL DISCUSSION ON THE IMPACT OF ACCESS TO LAND 
ON IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY AND ALLEVIATING RURAL POVERTY 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶21.  THE PANEL IS CONSIDERED "OFF THE RECORD" AND WILL BE 
HELD ON FRIDAY MORNING (5/16) BEFORE ADOPTION OF THE 
FINAL REPORT.  THE PANEL WILL LOOK AT SUCCESSFUL CASES OF 
LAND REFORM IN SELECTED COUNTRIES.  PANEL SPEAKERS ARE 
EXPECTED FROM BRAZIL, THE PHILIPPINES, A U.S. SPEAKER 
FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN LAND TENURE CENTER AND 
POSSIBLY A REPRESENTATIVE FROM SOUTH AFRICA.

REPORTING WAS UNSATISFACTORY.  IT WAS AGREED THAT THEY 
WOULD DISCUSS WITH THE BUREAU THE POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING 
AN INFORMAL WORKING GROUP DURING THE WEEK TO DISCUSS WAYS 
TO IMPROVE REPORTING ON THE WFS TARGETS.  FLORES ALSO 
WELCOMED NEWS THAT THE U.S. WAS CONSIDERING HOLDING A 
"SIDE-EVENT." (FLORES EXPLAINED THAT INTERPRETATION COSTS 
WOULD HAVE TO BE BORNE BY THE U.S.)  FLORES NOTED THAT

GUEST SPEAKERS AND SIDE EVENTS. 
 
COMMENT 
-------- 
¶24.  THE GOALS OF THE WORLD FOOD SUMMIT ARE TO BE 
ACCOMPLISHED BY COUNTRIES, NOT BY INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS; THE FAO PLAYS A SUPPORTING ROLE, BUT 
COUNTRIES MUST FEEL MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR REPORTING ON 
PROGRESS ACHIEVED.  THERE IS GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT THE 
CFS HAS BEEN PUTTING IN A LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE OVER THE 
LAST FEW YEARS, AND ONE INCOMMENSURATE WITH THE 
IMPORTANCE OF ITS MANDATE.  RECOGNIZING THAT THE CURRENT 
REPORTING FORMAT IS BURDENSOME, AND LEADS TO A HIGH RATE 
OF NON-REPORTING, IMPROVING THE COUNTRY REPORTING SYSTEM 
SHOULD BE ONE OF THE CFS'S HIGHEST PRIORITIES.   HALL
