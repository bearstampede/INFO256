¶1. (U) Classified by A/DCM Katherine Van de Vate for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (U) The UAEG officially claimed that 100,000 
illegal immigrants "benefited" from the amnesty which 
began January 1, 2003, and that 40,000 illegals have 
been arrested over the past few months. The Labor 
Ministry instigated the amnesty in hopes of removing 
illegal workers and establishing better control over 
the UAE labor market (see ref A).  Though the amnesty 
was extended until the end of June from its original 
April 30 deadline, the UAEG has now officially 
declared that illegals can continue to apply for exit 
visas indefinitely. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment: Though the amnesty failed to live up 
to expectations, the UAEG has decided to save face and 
declare victory. Based on conversations with foreign 
labor attaches, we reported in mid-June that 
approximately 60,000 workers had departed the UAE -- 
this estimate was in line with publicized official 
reports at the time. In recent follow-up phone 
conversations with the foreign labor attaches, all 
agreed that the UAEG was exaggerating both the number 
of people who departed as well as the number arrested. 
By claiming to take a hard line against illegal 
immigrants, but leaving the door open for departure, 
the UAEG hopes that more illegals will leave the 
country. However, workers do not fear getting caught - 
- even though they are threatened with jail time and 
financial penalties if caught, they know the reality 
is that they will simply be deported.  The UAE will 
not be able to control the illegal labor market via 
amnesties; true reform  will only be possible when the 
UAEG cracks down on UAE nationals profiting from the 
"free visa" scheme (see ref B). End comment.
