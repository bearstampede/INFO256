SUBJECT: (S)  UAEG FINDS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT 
ALLEGATION RE IRAQI ASSETS IN THE UAE 
 
REF:  STATE 135203 
 
¶1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE RICHARD ALBRIGHT FOR 
REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶2.  (S) A/DCM conveyed reftel concerns May 21 to 
UAE Central Bank Financial Intelligence Unit Chief 
Abdul-Rahim Sinkais Al-Awadhi.  A/DCM noted that we 
had a single, uncorroborated report that as much as 
one billion USD in cash had moved into accounts 
here belonging to the Al-Wasl and Babel Trading 
Company.  Al-Awadhi promised to check with the 
Central Bank Governor and get back to us. 
 
¶3.  (S)  On May 25, Al-Awadhi told A/DCM that, 
after consultations with the Governor, he was 
authorized to state that the UAEG has no 
information to support the allegation.  Large 
movements of cash of the nature described would 
immediately come to the attention of the Central 
Bank, and would in any case be reported by the 
relevant banks here to the authorities, since large 
cash deposits would automatically trigger reporting 
requirements.  Al-Awadhi suggested that the source 
of the information was likely not familiar with the 
relatively small size of the UAE financial sector, 
nor the oversight of that sector exercised by 
government authorities.  While hundreds of millions 
of dollars might be overlooked in New York or 
London, such substantial deposits into the UAE 
banking system would have instant visibility. 
A/DCM expressed appreciation for this information.
