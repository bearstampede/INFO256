SUMMARY

¶2.  (C) Post has been contacted several times by Amman-based 
Swedish diplomats seeking welfare and whereabouts assistance 
for a Swedish detainee held in Iraq.  The Embassy has been 
able to ascertain from the Coalition Provisional Authority 
(CPA) in Baghdad that the Swede is in U.S. custody, but we 
are unable to answer follow-up queries.  Post seeks 
Department guidance and requests the CPA formulate policy and 
designate a POC to deal with similar requests from other 
countries. End Summary.

¶3. (C) The Swedish Embassy has contacted the Embassy on 
several occasions -- including a formal diplomatic note --

custody in Iraq.  The Swedes provided the following

      Name: Haider Muhsin Saleh 
      DOB: July 1, 1962 
      Swedish Personal Ident. No.: 620701-0239 
      Swedish Passport No.: 23802467 
      Issued: January 22, 2003

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5. (C) We expect more such welfare/whereabouts requests in 
the coming months (we note that the Jordanian government has 
formally inquired about 37 Jordanians it believes are in 
custody in Iraq - reftel).  Post recommends the Department, 
CPA and CENTCOM define a clear policy for handling such 
inquiries, and designate a point of contact that can address 
such requests. 
 
¶6. (U) CPA Baghdad minimize considered.
