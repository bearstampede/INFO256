SUBJECT: UAE APPROVES ILO BIO-HAZARD RULES 
 
¶1. (U) The UAE approved the recommendations of the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) on ccupational 
health and safety.  The ILO agreed, in a conference 
last month, to new standards for the prevention of 
biological hazards in the workplace, calling for 
action to reduce the number of deaths, injuries and 
disease among workers. The action plan approved by the 
ILO requires states to guarantee the right to a safe 
and healthy working environment. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: The UAE continues to enact domestic 
labor laws that conform with international principles. 
The government understands well that the UAE economy, 
including the laws that regulate the labor market, 
must conform to global standards or it will lag 
behind.  Additionally, Minister of Labor Matar Humaid 
Al-Tayer and Undersecretary Dr. Khalid Al-Khazraji led 
the UAE delegation to Geneva -- a further indication 
of the importance of the ILO Conference to the UAEG 
and its commitment to labor reform. End comment.
