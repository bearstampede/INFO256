TAGS: PGOV PREL TU CY
SUBJECT: TURKEY/CYPRUS: TURK WAXES INDIGNANT AT GREEK 
CYPRIOT UN GAME PLAN 
 
 
(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reason: 1.5 (b)(d). 
 
 
¶1. (C) MFA Deputy U/S for Bilateral Political Affairs Baki 
Ilkin summoned reps from UNSC member countries April 11 to 
convey in a meandering fashion Ankara's concern with the 
"funny game" being played by Greek Cypriots in the UN.

It's Not Fair!

¶2. (C) While admitting that Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas 
had been outmaneuvered by Cyprus President Papadopoulos at 
the Hague, Ilkin decried Greek Cypriots for: (1) wanting to 
leave out any reference to the Annan Plan in a UNSC 
resolution; and (2) attempting to delay a resolution until 
after April 16, when Cyprus will officially join the EU.  His 
main objective was clearly to suggest that Denktas not be 
criticized, since the discussion of the resolution showed the 
Greek Cypriots' true reaction to the Annan Plan.  "The Greek 
Cypriots will be rewarded for leaving out the Annan Plan, 
which they previously had accepted.  How can Greek Cypriots 
get the credit?" he pleaded. 
 
 
¶3. (C) Ilkin further noted that he, "personally," did not 
object to the inclusion of a reference to the Annan Plan in a 
UNSC resolution but said that was up to the Council members. 
That said, "I can't say if Turkey views the draft resolution 
positively" -- nor whether the GOT or Denktas accepts the 
Annan Plan as the basis of negotiations.  In reply, DCM 
pointed out that US supported quick passage of a resolution 
that: (1) contains a clear reference to UNSYG's Good Offices 
mission; and (2) will keep the Annan Plan at the center of 
future negotiations.
