SUBJECT:  UAE:  REQUEST FOR CASH ASSISTANCE FOR 
WFP PROVISION OF IRAQI FOODSTUFFS 
 
REF:  STATE 70827 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) Polchief delivered reftel demarche on cash 
assistance for WFP provision of Iraq foodstuff to 
MFA Assistant U/S for Political Affairs Abdullah 
Rashid Al-Nuaimi on March 19.  Al-Nuaimi indicated 
that visiting WFP officials had held a meeting 
earlier in the day with the UAE Foreign Ministry to 
discuss the expeditious establishment of a WFP 
regional office in Dubai.  The Emiratis have 
authorized the establishment of the office and Al- 
Nuaimi believes it will be opened almost 
immediately in order to facilitate the movement of 
foodstuffs to Iraq.  He noted that the visiting WFP 
officials had not made mention of the need for cash 
assistance. 
 
¶3. (C) Al-Nuaimi promised to brief MFA Minstate 
Hamdan (who is also the Chairman of the UAE Red 
Crescent Authority) immediately on our request, but 
noted that the UAE would be channeling significant 
amounts of humanitarian assistance, including 
foodstuffs, via the UAE Red Crescent Authority, 
which already has a presence in Iraq and a 
relationship with the Iraqi Red Crescent Society. 
The UAE RCA employees intend to remain in Iraq 
during the conflict stage in order to ensure the 
continuing flow of assistance to the Iraqi people. 
Polchief suggested that it would be useful if the 
UAEG regularly briefed USG officials on their 
humanitarian assistance plans as that would help us 
understand the types of aid going to Iraq.
