¶1. (C)  Post notified the GOC of reftel points on May 22.  On 
May 28, the Department of Foreign Affairs notified us of the 
results of this morning's interagency meeting on possible 
responses to our demarche.  The GOC has decided to add al 
Aqsa Foundation to the Criminal Code listing workplan for 
designation as a terrorist entity,  a process that should 
take several months.  Not only do entities listed under the 
Criminal Code face financial restrictions, it is also a 
criminal offence to provide a wide range of other assistance 
to listed entities.  There are currently 26 individuals or 
entities listed under the Criminal Code. 
 
¶2. (S) The GOC had confirmed earlier this week that there are 
no known al Aqsa Foundation assets in Canada, a major factor 
in its decision to proceed with the slower but thorough 
Criminal Code listing process. 
 
¶3. (U) Note: The complete Criminal Code list is found on the 
GOC's Solicitor General web site (www.sgc.gc.ca).  The 
complete list of entities and individuals designated as 
terrorist financers is available on the Office of the 
Supervisor of Financial Institutions (OSFI) web site at (www. 
osfi-bsif.gc/ca/eng/documents/advisories/docs /entstlp/xls ).
