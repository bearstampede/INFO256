¶1.  (U) Classified by Charge d'Affaires Richard A. 
Albright, for reasons 1.5 (b)(c)(d). 
 
¶2.  (C) Summary: UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff 
Shaykh Muhammad bin Zayid Al-Nahyan (MbZ) visited May 
10 the newly refurbished Shaykh Zayid Hospital in 
Baghdad (formerly the Olympic Hospital) which opened 
its doors to the public last week.  The hospital was 
established on the orders of UAE President Shaykh 
Zayid bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, and an advance team of UAE 
military personnel (accompanied by a USLO 
representative) traveled to Baghdad last month to 
conduct a site assessment survey for the hospital 
(reftel).  During his visit, MbZ reportedly toured the 
facility, and spoke with a number of staff and 
patients.  The hospital has two pharmacies, an 
outpatient clinic, several operating rooms, and an 
initial stock of supplies to last at least 60 days. 
MbZ's visit was the first such visit by a senior 
Emirati to liberated Iraq and was made possible by the 
superb coordination and support provided by CENTCOM. 
A closely held secret in the planning stages, the 
visit was highlighted in all of the local papers 
today.  The Emiratis have gone to great lengths to 
publicize the generous humanitarian assistance 
provided to the Iraqi people by the UAEG via the UAE 
Red Crescent Authority, the Muhammad bin Rashid 
Charitable Foundation and last, but not least, the UAE 
Armed Forces.  End summary. 
 
¶3.  (C) In a May 6 meeting with the Ambassador, MbZ 
solicited her assistance in facilitating a short-fuse 
visit to the recently established Shaykh Zayid 
Hospital in Baghdad (formerly known as the Olympic 
Hospital).  MbZ wanted to visit his troops and see 
first-hand the situation on the ground.  He admitted 
he had been itching to get into Iraq since the 
dramatic fall of Baghdad on April 9.  The UAE Armed 
Forces were one of the first Arab/GCC military outfits 
to enter Iraq, when GHQ officers accompanied a UAE Red 
Crescent Authority vessel to Umm Qasr.  The Ambassador 
directed the Embassy's USLO office to coordinate MbZ's 
visit with CENTCOM.  CENTCOM did a spectacular job 
facilitating the visit and provided security for MbZ 
and his entourage during their two-and-a-half hours on 
the ground in Baghdad.  The Embassy's Acting USLO 
Chief accompanied the Emirati delegation. 
 
¶4.  (C) During his tour of the hospital, MbZ was 
briefed that the hospital receives approximately 1,000 
new patients every day.  Recent press reports indicate 
that Iraqis from areas outside of Baghdad are 
traveling to the hospital for medical treatment. 
Acting USLO Chief personally witnessed a queue of 
Iraqis seeking medical treatment leading outside of 
the hospital and down the street; it is clear that the 
hospital's staff is overwhelmed, but coping. 
Following his visit to the hospital, MbZ dropped by 
the Rashid Hotel where the UAE hospital staff are 
billeted, and the UAE Embassy in Baghdad to meet with 
the staff. 
 
 
¶5.  (C) Comment: The short visit to Baghdad was a win- 
win for everyone involved -- the UAE leadership saw 
firsthand the hospital's operations and facilities, 
and recognized the essential roles played by both 
CENTCOM and the Embassy in facilitating the delivery 
and set-up of this hospital.  On the return trip, 
MbZ's staff requested USG assistance in evacuating 
wounded Iraqis who require specialized medical care 
not available in Iraq.  We currently are coordinating 
with the UAE Red Crescent to evacuate 37 injured 
Iraqis (mostly children) to the UAE.  End comment.
