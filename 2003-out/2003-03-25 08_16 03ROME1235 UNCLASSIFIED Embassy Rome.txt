E.O. 12958:  N/A 
TAGS: AORC ABUD UNIDROIT
SUBJECT: MEETING OF UNIDROIT SUB-FINANCE COMMITTEE 
 
REF: A) STATE 68933   B) ROME 945 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: THE FINANCE SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR THE UNIFICATION OF PRIVATE 
LAW (UNIDROIT) MET ON MARCH 17 TO CONSIDER PRELIMINARY 
2004 BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR THE ORGANIZATION.  GIVEN THE 
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED OVER BUDGET 
UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING BOTH INCOME AND EXPENDITURES, NO 
REAL EFFORT WAS MADE TO FIND CONSENSUS.  THE SUB- 
COMMITTEE AGREED TO MEET AGAIN WHEN THE PICTURE BECOMES 
    CLEARER. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. U.S. MISSION REP ATTENDED THE 3/17 MEETING.  PER REF 
A) GUIDANCE, U.S. MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS: OUR BUDGET 
POLICY FOR ALL INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IS ZERO 
NOMINAL GROWTH; WE RECOGNIZE THE WORK UNIDROIT IS DOING 
AND CAN SUPPORT A MODEST INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE 
IMPORTANCE OF THE CAPETOWN CONVENTION DEPOSITARY FUNCTION 
AND FOR NECESSARY INCREASES IN STAFF EXPENSES; THIS DOES 
NOT REPRESENT A CHANGE IN U.S. POLICY BUT IS A ONE-TIME 
RECOGNITION OF THESE HIGH-PRIORITY ITEMS; AND WE WILL NOT 
SUPPORT AN INCREASE IN THE LEGAL COOPERATION PROGRAM BUT 
INSTEAD BELIEVE THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE SUPPORTED WITH 
EXTRA-BUDGETARY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THOSE COUNTRIES WHO 
FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT IT. 
 
¶3. CANADA AND GERMANY JOINED THE U.S. IN SUPPORTING A 
POLICY OF ZNG.  SEVERAL QUESTIONS WERE RAISED AND MORE 
DETAILS REQUESTED REGARDING STAFF SALARIES AND TRAVEL. 
INCOME UNCERTAINTIES REVOLVE AROUND TWO ISSUES: THE 
ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE 
POSSIBLE ACCESSION OF A NEW MEMBER (PANAMA), WHICH WOULD 
BRING IN NEW MONIES.  THE ITALIAN DELEGATE SAID THE GOI 
CONTRIBUTION MAY BE RESOLVED AFTER A MEETING BETWEEN 
UNIDROIT AND THE GOI MINISTRIES OF THE ECONOMY AND 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS, TO BE SCHEDULED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. 
THE SYG ADDED THAT MORE SHOULD ALSO BE KNOWN IN THE NEXT 
SEVERAL WEEKS ABOUT THE ACCESSION OF PANAMA. 
 
¶4. GIVEN THE REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL BUDGET DETAILS AND 
THE UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE GOI 
    AND PANAMA, THE SUB-COMMITTEE AGREED TO MEET AGAIN 
PROBABLY IN TWO OR THREE MONTHS RATHER THAN TRYING TO 
REACH CONSENSUS NOW.
