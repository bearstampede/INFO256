H.E. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
THE WHITE HOUSE 
 
YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
 
YOU ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MORE AWARE THAN ANY ONE ELSE THAT THE 
WORLD TODAY IS ON THE BRINK OF A DESTRUCTIVE WAR WHICH THOUGH 
CONCENTRATED ON ONE REGION MIGHT LEAD TO A GLOBAL 
CONFLAGRATION. WE RECOGNIZE PERFECTLY THE IMPORTANCE OF WORLD 
COOPERATION TO ELIMINATE ALL KINDS OF WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION WHEREVER THEY MAY BE FOUND WITHOUT 
DISCRIMINATION. WE APPRECIATE ALSO THE URGENT NEED TO COMBAT 
TERRORISM AND PUT AN END TO THE CULTURE OF TERRORISM WHEREVER 
IT MAY EXIST. AT THE SAME TIME WE BELIEVE THAT THIS TASK IS 
COMPLICATED. IT REQUIRES THE BACKING OF AN INTERNATIONAL 
CONSENSUS, BOTH OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL. MORE TIME IS NEEDED 
TO BRING ABOUT INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO ROOT OUT THE 
CULTURE OF TERROR AND TO ESTABLISH A CULTURE OF LOVE, 
SECURITY AND PEACE FOR THE WHOLE OF HUMANITY INCLUDING FUTURE 
GENERATIONS. 
 
WE THEREFORE URGE YOU, AS WE URGE BY A SIMILAR LETTER H.E. 
PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR AND H.E. PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSSEIN, 
AND AS WE WOULD URGE EVERY WORLD LEADER, TO FOREGO THE OPTION 
OF WAR AS A WAY OF ACHIEVING THESE NOBLE GOALS. THE OPTION OF 
WAR WOULD ONLY COMPLICATE MATTERS FURTHER, SINCE IT WOULD 
OPEN THE DOOR TO A TRAGIC SERIES OF CONFLICTS AND ACTS OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        VATICA  00700  220302Z 
TERROR THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. IT WOULD TEND TO LEND 
JUSTIFICATION TO TERRORISM AND THUS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF 
ITS SUPPORTERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. 
 
AS WE WRITE THIS LETTER TO YOU, YOUR EXCELLENCY, WE BELIEVE 
THAT YOU WILL GIVE IT SERIOUS CONSIDERATION, RECOGNIZING THAT 
OUR SOLE INTENTION IS TO SAVE HUMANITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT 
FROM A TERRIBLE DISASTER. WE WISH TO ASSURE YOU THAT 
RELIGIOUS LEADERS OF THE WORLD ARE READY TO COOPERATE WITH 
THE UNITED NATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SECURITY, PROSPERITY 
AND PEACE FOR ALL HUMAN SOCIETIES. 
 
WE LOOK FORWARD TO A POSITIVE RESPONSE ON YOUR PART.

¶3.  COMMENT:  ARCHBISHOP FITZGERALD HEADS THE HOLY SEE'S 
COUNCIL ON INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
OUTREACH TO MUSLIM GROUPS.  THE INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC FORUM 
FOR DIALOGUE IS THE COUNCIL'S PRINCIPAL INTERLOCUTOR IN THE 
MUSLIM WORLD.  TOGETHER THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED ON ONGOING 
DIALOGUE THAT HAS ADVOCATED MODERATION AND TOLERANCE AND HAS 
CONTRIBUTED TO GREATER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE MUSLIM AND 
CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES.  A SIMILAR LETTER WAS SENT AT THE SAME 
TIME TO PRIME MINISTER BLAIR ALONG WITH A MODIFIED ONE TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  00700  220302Z 
SADDAM HUSSEIN URGING HIM TO COMPLY WITH UN RESOLUTIONS. 
FITZGERALD, WHO HAS LONG EXPERIENCE WITH THE MUSLIM WORLD, 
HAS EXPRESSED TO US HIS CONCERN ABOUT THE FALLOUT OF A WAR IN 
IRAQ FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM, AND 
THIS LETTER IS NO DOUBT INTENDED TO REINFORCE THE SHARED 
DESIRE OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS OF BOTH FAITHS TO AVOID A WAR.
