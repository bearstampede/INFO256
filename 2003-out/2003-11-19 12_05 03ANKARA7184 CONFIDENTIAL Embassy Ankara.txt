E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/20/2013 
TAGS: PHUM PREL IR TU
SUBJECT: DEMARCHE:  SUPPORT FOR THE UNGA THIRD COMMITTEE 
IRAN RESOLUTION 
 
REF: A. STATE 317277 
     ¶B. STATE 318063 
 
 
(U) Classified by Political Counselor John Kunstadter, E.O. 
12958, reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
¶1.  (U) We delivered ref B demarche and, subsequently, 
Canadian draft resolution November 18 to Turkish MFA South 
Asia Department Head Soner. 
 
 
¶2.  (U) After reviewing the draft and citing "established 
practice that Turkey does not co-sponsor or vote in favor of 
resolutions against neighboring countries," Soner told us the 
GOT plans to abstain.  In explaining the decision, Soner 
declared that Turkey's best option is to abstain.  He 
expressed hope that Turkey's position will be helpful to the 
U.S. delegation at the UNGA Third Committee session at least 
at a minimum level. 
 
 
¶3.  (C) Discussing Turkish-Iranian relations in general, 
Soner observed that Iran should be watched seriously because 
of its nuclear technology expertise, its avowed policy to 
develop a nuclear bomb and its ability to "function 
intelligently in international relations."  He  cited Iran's 
violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as another 
reason for Turkey's concern.  Finally, Soner averred that the 
public statements of Turkish-Iranian rapprochement and 
friendship had all been initiated by Iran, not Turkey.
