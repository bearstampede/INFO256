Received two phone calls from Amcits employed 
in Kuwait.  Both asked about Embassy departure 
status because their employers are urging them 
to return. Callers were informed Embassy remains 
on ordered departure and that any change would 
be posted on the Dept website and sent out as 
a warden message.
