(C) MFA Iraq Desk Officer Haldun confirmed to Operation 
Northern Watch POLAD Feb. 12 that Turkey will not/not permit 
individuals volunteering to be human shields to enter Iraq 
directly from Turkey.  Haldun said MFA U/S Ziyal had given 
his word on this to Ambassador Pearson (see reftel).  Haldun 
pointed out that the volunteers might be able to get into 
Iraq from other neighboring states after departing Turkey (he 
specifically mentioned Syria) and that there was nothing 
Turkey could do to prevent that.
