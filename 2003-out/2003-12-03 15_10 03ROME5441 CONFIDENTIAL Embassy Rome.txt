"UNACCEPTABLE"

CLASSIFIED BY: POL MINISTER COUNSELOR TOM COUNTRYMAN REASON:1.5 (B)(D). 
 
¶1. (C) ACCORDING TO MFA DESK OFFICER FOR MOLDOVA LORENZO 
ORTONA, MOLDOVAN PRESIDENT VORONIN INFORMED BOTH PRESIDENT 
CIAMPI AND PM BERLUSCONI THAT HE FOUND THE "KOZAK" DOCUMENT 
UNACCEPTABLE.  VORONIN MADE CLEAR TO HIS ITALIAN 
INTERLOCUTORS DURING HIS NOVEMBER 27 VISIT TO ROME THAT 
NEGOTIATIONS TO SETTLE THE TRANSNISTRIAN CONFLICT MUST RETURN 
TO THE LONG-STANDING "FIVE PARTIES" (OSCE, RUSSIA, UKRAINE, 
MOLDOVA, TRANSNISTRIA) MEDIATION PROCESS UNDER THE OSCE 
COORDINATION UMBRELLA. 
 
¶2. (C)  VORONIN TOLD BERLUSCONI THAT HE VIEWED THE PLAN AS A 
GOOD INITIATIVE BY RUSSIA IN LOOKING FOR CREATIVE FORMULAS TO 
MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD.  HOWEVER, VORONIN AGREED WITH 
POINTS IN REFTELS HIGHLIGHTING THE NONTRANSPARENT MANNER IN 
WHICH THE AGREEMENT WAS BROKERED.  FURTHER, MOLDOVANS COULD 
NEVER LIVE WITH MOSCOW'S SIDEBAR TO THE AGREEMENT WHICH WOULD 
HAVE ALLOWED UP TO 2000 RUSSIAN TROOPS TO REMAIN IN 
TRANSNISTRIA UNTIL 2020. 
 
¶3. (C)  VORONIN MINCED NO WORDS WHEN REFERRING TO THE 
TIRASPOL AUTHORITIES.  TRANSNISTRIA IS A "STALINIST REGIME" 
UNDER THE CONTROL OF A "MAFIA-LIKE CRIMINAL POLITICAL 
SYSTEM."  THE KEY TO BREAKING THE IMPASSE IS MOSCOW, VORONIN 
EMPHASIZED.  RUSSIA MUST USE ITS INFLUENCE OVER TRANSNISTRIAN 
AUTHORITIES TO AGREE TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT 
AND FOLLOW UP WITH A COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL OF MILITARY FORCES 
    AND WEAPONS AS CALLED FOR UNDER THE CFE ISTANBUL ACCORD. 
MOLDOVA IS COUNTING ON THE OSCE, AND EVENTUALLY THE EU, TO 
HELP END THIS STALEMATE AND ASSIST CHISINAU TO REBUILD ITS 
ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURES. 
 
¶4. (SBU) ORTONA SAID THAT BERLUSCONI HAD ASSURED VORONIN THAT 
MOLDOVANS WOULD CONTINUE TO BE CONSIDERED FAIRLY FOR 
NORMALIZED STATUS AS ITALY IMPLEMENTS 2002 IMMIGRATION REFORM 
LEGISLATION (THE "BOSSI-FINI" LAW).  VORONIN WAS PLEASED TO 
LEARN THAT ITALY WOULD INCREASE, FROM 500 IN 2003 TO 700 IN 
2004, THE NUMBER OF MOLDOVANS GRANTED LEGAL STATUS TO WORK IN 
ITALY.
