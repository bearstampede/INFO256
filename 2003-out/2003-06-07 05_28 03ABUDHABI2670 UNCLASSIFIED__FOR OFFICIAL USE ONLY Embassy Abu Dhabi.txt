SUBJECT: THREE MORE LABOR STRIKES RESOLVED 
 
REF: ABU DHABI 2323 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (U) In the last week, the local English dailies 
reported on three labor strikes, two in Dubai and one 
in Abu Dhabi. All three labor stoppages involved the 
nonpayment of wages by contracting firms and resulted 
in the intervention of the UAE Labor Ministry to 
mediate a resolution between the parties. The Ministry 
dispatched a legal consultant and inspectors to review 
each complaint and negotiated settlements that 
provided immediate payment of a portion of the wages 
and an installment plan for the rest, in addition to 
regular salary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: Similar work stoppages and 
resolutions have occurred periodically in both Abu 
Dhabi and Dubai, though they are not technically 
sanctioned by law (see reftel). Ministry officials 
generally are sympathetic to the workers' plight and 
negotiate a quick settlement. In addition to these 
informal dispute resolution mechanisms, the government 
is also proceeding with legislation permitting the 
creation of unions.  This week's strikes -- and 
subsequent resolution by the MOL -- are just the 
latest examples of the UAEG's ongoing efforts to 
improve labor standards countrywide. End comment.
