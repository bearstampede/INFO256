Haldun Tekneci August 15.  Tekneci thanked PolMilOff but made 
no comment on the information. 
 
 
¶2. (C)  During an introductory call August 18, MFA U/S Ziyal 
gave the Ambassador a brief readout of Pakistani FonSec 
Khokhar's meetings in Ankara.  According to Ziyal, the GOT 
encouraged Pakistan to contribute to the stabilization force, 
noting that it was important to have Muslim countries 
involved.  The GOT also offered to "help" Pakistan, but Ziyal 
did not specify what type of assistance Turkey was prepared 
to offer.  Ziyal said Pakistan had not decided whether to 
participate in the force, but he inferred from his Pakistani 
counterpart that Islamabad was hesitant because it perceived 
such a deployment as potentially injurious to the 
conventional balance of forces between India and Pakistan.
