MACROECONOMIC OVERVIEW 
---------------------- 
 
¶1. The Honduran economy grew at a rate of 2.5 percent in 
2002, similar to its 2.6 percent growth rate in 2001. Since 
the population growth rate is approximately 2.6 percent, 
Honduras has enjoyed essentially zero real per capita 
economic growth over the last two years.  Major factors 
influencing the Honduran economic performance were the slow 
international (especially the U.S.) economy, the continuing 
coffee crisis, and low international prices for other export 
products. 
 
¶2. According to the Consumer Price Index, the inflation rate 
in 2002 was 8.1 percent, similar to the inflation rate for 
the last two years and compatible with the GOH's goal of 
maintaining the inflation rate at a stable and acceptable 
level.  The Central Bank continued to depreciate the nominal 
exchange rate of the lempira by 6 percent against the dollar 
in 2002, in order to maintain purchasing power parity with 
the United States.  Interest rates fell by a percentage 
point during the year.  The minimum wage increased by 12 
percent for workers in small agriculture, but approximately 
nine percent for most other workers, more than compensating 
for the rate of inflation. 
 
¶3. Net international reserves reached USD 130.5 at the end 
of 2002, USD 10 million higher than expected. This level was 
equivalent to 3.8 months of imports. 
 
¶4. Monetary policy was oriented to maintenance of a stable 
exchange rate and to maintain a normal functioning of the 
payment system.  Open market operations were the principal 
instruments used.  The Central Bank uses an auction system 
to regulate the allocation of foreign exchange. 
 
¶5. There was a positive flow of net transfers during the 
year, due to an increase in family remittances, but the 
current account showed a deficit of USD 243 million.  The 
commercial deficit in 2002 reached USD 1.4 billion.  There 
was also a decrease in direct investment and net long-term 
loans to the official sector that decreased the balance of 
the capital account as well. 
 
¶6. During 2002, the balance of the public external debt was 
USD 4.4 billion, 5.7 percent higher than the amount owed at 
the end of 2001.  The GOH continues its policy of taking on 
only foreign concessional loans for projects of high 
priority. 
 
¶7. After adopting a series of austerity and tax measures, 
the GOH closed 2002 with a central government fiscal deficit 
of Lps. 5.7 billion (USD 345 million) which represents 5.2 
percent of the GDP, down from the six percent registered in 
¶2001.  The financing of this deficit came mostly from 
foreign loans.

ECONOMIC ACTIVITY 
----------------- 
¶8. According to GOH data, economic growth in 2002 was 2.5 
percent, slightly less than the rate of 2.6 percent observed 
in 2001.  Honduras' growth was the highest of the Central 
American countries, except for Costa Rica.  The increase in 
agricultural activity was 4.8 percent due to an increase in 
corn production (22 percent), rice (21.2 percent), and beans 
(43.8 percent).  The production of banana and sugar cane 
declined due to labor conflicts in one of the most important 
banana producing companies and bad weather conditions that 
affected sugar production in the south-central part of the 
country.

PRICES AND WAGES

¶9. The end of period Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 8.1 
percent growth during 2002, slightly lower than the 8.8 
percent growth registered in 2001, continuing the declining 
trend of the past four years.  This result was in part 
obtained by the stability of the real exchange rate, the 
application of prudent monetary policy, an increased 
domestic supplies of basic grains due to increases in 
national production, helping to moderate food prices.  There 
were also informal price controls for part of the year. 
Increases in gasoline prices and public transportation 
offset the favorable effect of the food index.

EMPLOYMENT 
---------- 
 
¶10. Employment data is collected once per year by the 
National Institute of Statistics (INE) through a survey 
conducted each September.  The labor market was closely 
linked with the economic activity of the country, which can 
be observed in the stagnant behavior of the labor market. 
Employment rose by only 2.3 percent, mostly representing new 
labor joining the informal side of the market.  There was 
also a 2.7 percent increase in the economically active 
population in September 2002 with respect to the same month 
in 2001.  Even though there was a decrease observed in open 
unemployment, the increase of almost 3 percentage points of 
underemployment is significant.  It demonstrates that the 
majority of the emerging labor force is entering the 
informal part of the economy. 
 
¶11. The employment level in the textile industry showed a 
decrease for the second straight year.  According to the 
Maquila Association, in 2002 this industry had a total of 
107,398 direct jobs, which means that 2,685 jobs were lost 
with respect to 2001 (2.4 percent) as a result of the 
closing of 13 companies.

¶12. The latest revision of the minimum wage (an increase of 
12 percent for workers in small agriculture and 
approximately nine percent for most other workers) was 
implemented in spring 2003.  New negotiations will start in 
November of this year for the 2004 increase. 
 
------------------- 
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS 
------------------- 
 
¶13. Net international reserves increased by USD 214.0 
million in 2002 to reach USD 1.85 billion, as a result of 
the positive balance in the long-term capital account of the 
private sector and also due to large transfers, especially 
in net family remittances, which increased 32.1 percent 
compared to 2001. 
¶14. The balance of the capital account was USD 187.8 million 
that represents a reduction of 18.6 percent from 2001 caused 
mainly by a reduction in direct investment and also long- 
term loans to the official sector. 
 
¶15. The current account deficit in 2002 was USD 243.0 
million, equivalent to 3.7 percent of GDP.  The current 
account balance was a result of various factors: a reduction 
of 0.6 percent in imports, and the increase of 3.0 percent 
in overseas net transfers product of a bigger flow in family 
remittances that rose from USD 533.0 in 2001 to USD 704.3 
million in 2002.

EXPORTS 
------- 
 
¶16. Honduras' export value in 2002 was USD 1.37 billion, 
down by 1.5 percent from 2001.  This decrease was due mainly 
to lower exports of banana, shrimp, soaps and detergents 
because of big price declines.  In 2002, Honduras exported 
USD 665.2 million to the U.S., an amount equivalent to 48.5 
percent of total exports.

the dominant source of FDI in Honduras with investment in 
2002 reaching an estimated USD 54,500.0 million, or 38.1 
percent of total FDI in Honduras.  These totals do not 
include the accumulated investments in the maquila industry, 
which is considerable.

INTEREST RATES 
-------------- 
 
¶19. In 2002, nominal interest rates declined slightly, due 
in part to the Central Bank's monetary policy, which 
included the elimination of the obligatory investment 
requirement to the financial system, providing more 
liquidity and resources for the productive sector. 
 
¶20. In December 2002, the average nominal interest rate in 
local currency for new loans was 20.9 percent and for long 
term deposits was 12 percent, which represents a reduction 
of 1.3 and 2.1 percentage points respectively compared to 
the end of 2001 averages. 
 
¶21. The average nominal interest rates on new operations in 
foreign currency  - loans and deposits at the end of 2002  - 
- were 9.4 percent and 2.6 percent respectively which means 
a reduction of 2.5 and 2.1 percentage points compared to the 
end of 2001 averages.  This decrease is directly related to 
the continued reduction of interest rates internationally.

PUBLIC SECTOR FINANCES 
---------------------- 
 
¶25. The Central Government fiscal deficit at the end of 2002 
was Lps. 5.849 billion (USD 345.7 million), equivalent to 
5.4 percent of GDP, lower than the 6 percent observed in 
¶2001. 
 
¶26. The 2002 central government deficit was mainly financed 
through domestic financing (66.2 percent of total) compared 
to foreign financing  (33.8 percent).  Regarding domestic 
financing, it is important to point out that most of the 
resources were obtained through transfers from Hondutel (the 
State-owned telephone company) of Lps. 2.485 billion (USD 
146.8 million) equivalent to almost 60 percent of the 
required resources.  This source of funds is now basically 
exhausted. 
 
¶27. During 2002, tax collection increased to Lps. 17.3 
billion (USD 1.021 billion) equivalent to 16.0 percent of 
GDP, slightly lower than the 16.2 percent reached in 2001. 
Tax income increased by 7.4 percent (in nominal terms) with 
respect to 2001, compared to a 10.0 percent increase in 
¶2000.  The decrease in tax income occurred primarily in the 
first semester of 2002 and was largely counterbalanced in 
the second semester as a result of the administrative 
measurements adopted by the application of the new law of 
Financial Equilibrium approved by Congress in May 2002. Part 
of the declines in the first semester were attributed to 
falling income from oil taxes due to oil prices and part 
from scheduled declines in some import duties as a result of 
trade and regional integration agreements. 
¶28. Total expenditures of the Central Government were Lps. 
26.773 billion (USD 1.6 billion) which were 4 percent higher 
than to 2001, due to the increase of 10.7 percent in current 
expenditures and a reduction of 12.6 percent in capital 
expenditures.  The increase in current expenditures was due 
to a 16.7 percent increase in salaries (primarily teachers). 
There was a decrease of 4.7 percent in goods and services 
expenditures as a result of the measures taken by the 
government to control public sector expenditures, and a law 
approved by Congress in May 2002 to control expenditures.

FOREIGN DEBT

¶29. Honduras's foreign debt, which is held by the official 
sector, Central Bank and private sector (financial and non- 
financial) in the year 2002, was USD 4.963 billion, up 3.2 
percent (USD 155.7 million) from 2001; mainly due to the 
U.S. dollar devaluation with respect to other currencies 
that are the components of the baskets of the international 
lending institutions, since net flows (reimbursements minus 
capital payments) increased only by USD 10.2 million.  The 
relation of the total debt to the GDP in 2002 was 75.6 
percent, very similar to 75.1 percent in 2001. 
 
¶30. Foreign debt service in 2002 was USD 583.5 million, USD 
466.0 million of capital and USD 117.5 million in interest. 
In 2002, under the HIPC initiative, Honduras was scheduled 
to receive total debt relief of USD 48.8 million.  Of this 
relief, USD 35.5 million are resources to be used for the 
financing of the Poverty Reduction Strategy. Honduras has 
not yet reached the HIPC completion point.

¶31. Tourism is one of the priority sectors for the GOH, 
which hopes it will generate a substantial number of jobs 
and economic growth.  The three project goals are the 
Caribbean Creation, a Mayan Route and Nature Adventure. 
Each of these projects contain several smaller clusters of 
projects.  The Caribbean Creation involves encouraging 
tourism development in the Bay Islands and the northern 
coast of Honduras, focusing on beaches and reefs.  The goal 
is to increase to one million tourists and USD 500 million 
income in foreign exchange.  The second project is a 
complete Mayan Route from Copan to other archeological sites 
and will involve visitors from cruise ships flying to Copan. 
The third project is marketing and developing eco-tourism on 
the north shore, national parks and in the Copan Ruins area.
