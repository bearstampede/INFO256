SUBJECT: NAVCENT COMMANDER'S FAREWELL CALL IN 
THE UAE 
 
Ref: Abu Dhabi 4206 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) Summary: USNAVCENT Commander Vice Admiral 
Timothy J. Keating made a visit to the UAE on 
September 13-14.  In Abu Dhabi, he called on UAE 
Armed Forces Chief of Staff LTG Sheikh Muhammad bin 
Zayed Al-Nahyan (MbZ) and Commander of UAE Naval 
Forces Major General Suhail Al-Marar.  In Dubai, he 
called on Dubai Crown Prince Gen. Sheikh Muhammad 
bin Rashid Al-Maktoum.  The discussion with MbZ 
concentrated on Iraq, Iraqi oil smuggling, and the 
global war on terror. 
 
¶3. (S/NF) Summary continued: As he did during his 
meeting with CENTCOM Commander General Abizaid (see 
reftel), MbZ urged more work with Sunni tribal 
leaders to ensure the Sunni community will have a 
stake in the future of Iraq.  MbZ reacted 
positively to Keating's proposal to transfer the 
five Chinese-manufactured patrol boats stored in 
Jebel Ali Dubai to the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr with 
the goal of having the Iraqi navy patrol its own 
waters within a year.  Keating thanked the Emiratis 
for their ongoing supportive role in the Gulf 
region and in Afghanistan, and said he was leaving 
the region with the realization that the US still 
has much to learn about the Arab perspective on 
issues.  End summary. 
 
¶4. (C) Vice Admiral Keating made his farewell visit 
to the UAE on September 13-14.  MbZ received 
Keating at his palace in Abu Dhabi.  The 
Ambassador, USLO Chief, Naval Attache, USNAVCENT 
Security Cooperation Officer, USNAVCENT Flag Aide, 
and Polchief (notetaker) attended.  MbZ was 
accompanied by MG Suhail and Senior Assistant 
Yousef Al-Otaiba. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Training Iraq's Navy, stopping oil smuggling 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (S/NF) Keating expressed his thanks to MbZ and 
Suhail for the UAE's naval contribution and close 
cooperation with Coalition forces during OIF.  He 
proposed expanding that cooperation to include 
Iraq's new navy.  Five Chinese-manufactured patrol 
boats, diverted from delivery to the former Iraqi 
regime and currently stored at Jebel Ali near 
Dubai, could soon be transferred to Umm Qasr.  With 
US Navy and potential UAE Navy assistance, Iraqi 
sailors could receive training and begin patrolling 
Iraqi waters within a year.  Keating emphasized the 
need to act against oil smugglers by seizing 
vessels and prosecuting crews.  He said a customs 
judge from Basra held hearings on cases involving 
vessels smuggling Iraqi oil, and those cases are 
now in the hands of the Iraqi Justice Ministry for 
prosecution.  Keating told MbZ that this marked the 
first time the Iraqi authorities had exercised 
their legal powers in regard to smuggling.  Some of 
the ships that are being detained are apparently 
owned by Dubai-based companies. 
 
¶6. (S/NF) MbZ reiterated his belief that Coalition 
forces erred when they dismantled the Iraqi army 
and police force.  The decision robbed the country 
of a core of experienced officers, soldiers, and 
law enforcement elements - not all loyal to Saddam 
Hussein, MbZ said.  Keating acknowledged the 
resultant problems and said we are now helping 
train a new police force and Iraqi army. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Sunnis: Save them from Saddam, UBL 
---------------------------------- 
¶7. (S/NF) MbZ focused on the particular problem of 
Sunnis in post-Saddam Iraq.  He said it is 
important that Sunni tribal leaders be assured that 
they have a political stake in the new Iraq.  In 
the battle of Iraqi Sunni hearts and minds, "We 
cannot let those who are not supporting Saddam go 
with those who are with Saddam," MbZ said.  By not 
addressing the Sunnis' needs, the Coalition risks 
giving Usama bin Laden and other extremist groups a 
foothold.  "Usama bin Laden is investing in the 
Sunnis.  I would not let that happen." 
 
¶8. (S/NF) In a final note about Saddam Hussein, MbZ 
said it would be a mistake to take the former Iraqi 
leader alive because he would become a hero. 
 
¶9. (U) This cable was cleared by Vice Admiral 
Keating.
