SUBJECT: (C) WESTERN OIL EXEC CLARIFIES COMMENTS REGARDING 
UAE OIL PRODUCTION 
 
REF A: ABU DHABI 1086 REF B: ABU DHABI 1289 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, for 
reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C/NF) A western oil executive previously commented to 
Econchief that the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is 
producing about 10 percent or 200,000 barrels per day (b/d) 
over its current OPEC quota of 2.138 million barrels per 
day (mmb/d) (ref A).  The western oil exec clarified on March 
19 that the above-mentioned overproduction also includes an 
approximate 120,000-150,000 b/d of oil from Dubai. 
 
¶3.  (S/NF) Comment: This tracks well with ADNOC officials' 
disclosure this week that Abu Dhabi is producing 2.2 mmb/d 
(ref B), which combined with Dubai's production indicates that 
the UAE is over-producing its quota by about 200,000 barrels 
per day. OPEC's production quota for the UAE encompasses output 
from both Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  However, as Dubai was not a 
member of OPEC at the time of the UAE's federation (1971) -- 
and because Abu Dhabi production is so much larger than Dubai's 
-- it has long been the policy here that Dubai will produce as 
much oil as it can, with Abu Dhabi filling the rest of the UAE's 
quota.
