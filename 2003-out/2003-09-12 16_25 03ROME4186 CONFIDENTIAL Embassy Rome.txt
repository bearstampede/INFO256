CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING POL M/C J. BASS, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
    ¶1. (C) ON SEPTEMBER 11, POLOFFS MET WITH MFA GULF COUNTRIES 
OFFICE DIRECTOR, LUIGI MACCOTTA, TO CONSULT ON THE UNGA THIRD 
COMMITTEE IRAN RESOLUTION (REF C). POLOFF ALSO LEFT POINTS 
WITH THE MFA'S HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICE, WHOSE OFFICIALS WERE 
UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT. MACCOTTA STATED THAT ALTHOUGH THE EU 
IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE WORSENING HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN 
IRAN, IT DOES NOT WANT TO JEOPARDIZE FUTURE DIALOGUE WITH 
IRAN AND THEREFORE DOES NOT FAVOR A RESOLUTION AT THIS TIME. 
 
¶2. (C) MACCOTTA SAID THE EU BELIEVES IN THE NEED TO PRESERVE 
A DIALOGUE IN ORDER TO DELIVER A "MESSAGE OF CRITICISM" AND 
STATED THAT TABLING A RESOLUTION AT THIS TIME WOULD BE 
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE SINCE IT WOULD "CONDEMN" AND "ISOLATE" 
IRAN. HE EXPRESSED ITALY'S SUPPORT OF THE EU VIEW, 
REITERATING THE GOI'S PREFERENCE TO USE A CARROT RATHER THAN 
A STICK APPROACH WITH IRAN. 
 
¶3. (C) MACCOTTA CONFIRMED THE RECENT DECISION TO POSTPONE THE 
EU-IRAN HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE, SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 15-16, 
DUE TO IRAN'S OBJECTION TO THE PRESENCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH 
AND AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL REPRESENTATIVES. HE STATED THAT THE 
DIALOGUE HAS NOT BEEN RESCHEDULED AND REFERRED TO THIS PERIOD 
AS A "SHORT-TERM PAUSE FOR REFLECTION."
