¶1.   Summary: The Consular Section received the visa 
    application of an individual presenting a Brazilian passport 
    and stating he also held the passports of Libya, Egypt and 
    Turkey. Individual intended to travel as part of an official 
    UAE delegation to the United States. After contacting the Fraud 
    Unit at the US Consulate General in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the 
    Brazilian passport was found to be fraudulent.  In addition, a 
    Local Lookout entered by Post in November 2001 from a 
    Diplomatic Note circulated by the UAE Embassy in Baghdad, 
    showed that the same individual had lost a UAE diplomatic 
    passport issued in his name. End Summary. 
 
¶2.   On 10 May 2003, the Consular Section received the visa 
    application of TATANAKI, Hassan Salah El Din, DPOB, 04 Jan 
    1957, Libya. The individual presented a Brazilian passport 
    issued in Sao Paulo in November 2002.  The Fraud Unit in Sao 
    Paulo confirmed with the Federal Police that although they had 
    a record of a passport issued with the above bio data, the 
    photo in their files did not match the one in the passport or 
    visa application.  Furthermore, conoffs in Ankara confirmed 
    with Turkish Passport authorities that there is no record of a 
    Turkish passport issued to the above individual. 
 
¶3.   A local check of NIV records showed a Local Lookout for 
    the above individual.  The Lookout file indicated that the UAE 
    Embassy in Baghdad had sent a series of diplomatic notes on 
    October 2, 2001, reporting that a total of 13 UAE diplomatic 
    passports had been lost, one of which belonged to a TATARIAKI, 
    Hassan Salah Aldeen. Checks with consular contacts at UAE 
    Immigration confirmed that this is the same individual. 
 
¶4.   A check of the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) showed 
    that the individual's brother TATANAKI, Faez Salah El Din, 
    DPOB, 12 May 1954, Libya, had presented a fraudulent Brazilian 
    passport in London in February 1999 and had been refused for 
    misrepresentation and fraud, INA 212(a)(6)(C).  In addition, in 
    February 2002, the same brother had a visa in a Turkish 
    passport revoked under INA 212(a)(3)(A)(i) by conoffs in Cairo. 
 
¶5.   Comment:  The case of Hassan Tatanaki illustrates the 
    continuing problems associated with the issuance UAE passports 
    to non-UAE nationals.  As reported in previous cables (see 
    refs), the basis for issuance of a UAE passport to an 
    individual may only be the individual's connection to 
    influential ruling family members.  In this particular case, 
    the individual also held passports from four other countries, 
    at least one of which was fraudulent. The individual has been 
    entered into CLASS under section 212(a)(6)(C) of the INA. End 
    Comment.
