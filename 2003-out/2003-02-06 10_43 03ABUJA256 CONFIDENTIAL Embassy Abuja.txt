SUBJECT: NIGERIA: UWECHUE SEES SMOOTH SAILING AHEAD FOR 
OBASANJO CAMPAIGN 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR HOWARD F. JETER; REASONS 1.5 (B) 
AND (D). 
 
 
(C) During a January 9 meeting with Ambassador Jeter, 
Nigerian Special Presidential Envoy on Conflict Resolution 
Ambassador Raph Uwechue shared his thoughts on President 
Obasanjo's prospects for reelection.  Uwechue said that All 
Nigerian People's Party (ANPP) nominee Maj. Gen. (Ret.) 
Mohammedu Buhari is well liked and respected among Northern 
Muslims.  However, Buhari is singularly unpopular with 
Christians and Southerners, making it unlikely that he 
could win the election.  Uwechue did not believe Buhari's 
partner on the ticket, former Senate President Chuba 
Okadigbo, and Igbo, would rally many Southerners to the 
ANPP flag.  In the absence of other credible opposition, 
Uwechue thought President Obasanjo would easily win a 
second term.
