¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (S) The Ambassador, accompanied by Polchief, 
presented Ref A demarche and background paper to 
MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan on 5/31. 
Hamdan was not aware of the issue, but promised to 
bring it to the attention of the Dubai authorities. 
On 6/1, Hamdan's office director, Sultan Al- 
Romaithi, contacted Polchief to report that he had 
briefed Ateeq Juma'a, the Intel Advisor to Dubai 
Crown Prince Muhammad bin Rashid Al-Maktoum (MbR), 
on our demarche and suggested that our Consul 
General in Dubai follow-up with MbR's Executive 
Office on the issue.  Dubai CG Olson has requested 
these meetings.
