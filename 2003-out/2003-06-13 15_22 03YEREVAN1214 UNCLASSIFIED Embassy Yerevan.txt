SUBJECT: GOAM WELCOMES MOVE TO TIER II ON TIP REPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 156656 
 
¶1. (U) SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE TREAT 
ACCORDINGLY. 
 
    ¶2. (U) POLOFFS DELIVERED COPIES OF THE 2003 TRAFFICKING IN 
PERSONS REPORT TO MFA HUMAN RIGHTS DESK OFFICER AND ACTING 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HEAD (MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS 
DIRECTOR), KARINE SOUDJIAN, JUNE 12 PER INSTRUCTIONS IN 
REFTEL.  SOUDJIAN EXPRESSED THE GOAM'S SATISFACTION THAT 
ARMENIA HAD BEEN CLASSIFIED IN THIS YEAR'S REPORT AS A TIER 
II COUNTRY. 
 
¶3. (U) SOUDJIAN ALSO OUTLINED FUTURE STEPS THE GOAM WILL 
TAKE TO COMBAT TRAFFICKING THROUGH ITS DRAFT NATIONAL PLAN 
OF ACTION (NPA).  THE DRAFT NPA IS UNDER REGULAR REVIEW BY 
THE GOAM'S "INTER-AGENCY COMMISSION TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING."  SOUDJIAN SAID THAT THE MFA HOPES THE 
DRAFT WILL BE FORMALLY ADOPTED BY THE GOAM LATER THIS MONTH. 
(NOTE:  POST HAS FORWARDED AN ENGLISH VERSION OF THE NPA TO 
G/TIP FOR COMMENT.  END NOTE.)  SHE HIGHLIGHTED VARIOUS 
INITIATIVES UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMISSION THAT 
INVOLVE MICRO ENTERPRISE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DESIGNED 
TO ASSIST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS.  SOUDJIAN SAID THAT THE 
GOAM HOPES THESE PROGRAMS WILL HELP ENHANCE THE PROTECTION 
SERVICES AVAILABLE TO VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING. 
 
¶4. (SBU) SOUDJIAN ADDED HER SURPRISE THAT, GIVEN THE 
POSITIVE MOVE TO TIER II, THE NARRATIVE SECTION ON ARMENIA 
APPEARED TO CONTAIN MORE NEGATIVE THAN POSITIVE COMMENTARY. 
SHE ALSO INQUIRED WHY DISCUSSION OF AZERBAIJAN WAS NOT 
INCLUDED IN THE REPORT.  SHE EMPHASIZED THAT HER OFFICE 
CONSIDERS THE TRANSNATIONAL NATURE OF THE TRAFFICKING ISSUE 
AND SAID THE GOAM VIEWED THE PROBLEM AS A "REGIONAL ONE, NOT 
LIMITED TO OUR NATIONAL TERRITORY."
