¶1. (U) Classified by CDA Richard Albright for reasons 1.5 
(b) and (d). 
 
¶2. (C) Summary:  Charge met with MFA Assistant 
Undersecretary for Political Affairs Abdullah Rashid Al- 
Nuami to urge that the UAEG donate generously at the Madrid 
donors' conference.  Al-Nuami confirmed that the UAE was 
actively reviewing the Iraqi needs assessments and trying to 
determine the level of its contribution.  He said that the 
final decision would be made by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince 
Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al-Nahyan.  End Summary. 
 
¶3. (C) Charge and econchief called on MFA Assistant 
Undersecretary for Political Affairs Abdullah Rashid Al- 
Nuami on October 14 to urge the UAEG to pledge as 
generously as possible at the Madrid Donors conference. 
(ref. a)  Al-Nuami said that the UAE was in the process of 
evaluating the Iraqi needs assessment in order to develop a 
pledge that the UAE could afford, which also met Iraqi 
needs.  He said that the UAE supported Iraqi redevelopment 
and understood the importance of a healthy and stable Iraq. 
The exact size of the UAE pledge would be decided on by Abu 
Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al-Nahyan. 
 
¶4. (C) According to Al-Nuami, the UAE was totaling up the 
size of all its current and projected future assistance to 
Iraq in order to provide a clear picture of the total level 
of its assistance.  In response to a question from Charge, 
he noted that the UAE's practice and preference has been to 
work bilaterally rather than "writing a check" to the 
multilateral fund.  He said, however, that the UAE would 
coordinate its assistance with Iraq's projected needs and 
budget plans and would not provide assistance in areas that 
weren't identified as needs. 
 
¶5. (C) Al-Nuami said that the UAEG had not decided on the 
exact modalities of its assistance to Iraq, but that he 
thought it would take a "share" of agreed on reconstruction 
projects.  The UAEG would either work with the World Bank, 
UNDP, or the Iraqis to identify projects.  He said that he 
believed that the Japanese had proposed bilateral "windows" 
to fund projects identified by the reconstruction plan and 
said that was an approach that appealed to the UAE. 
 
¶6. (C) Al-Nuami told Charge that he believed the GCC would 
play an active roll at the donors' conference.  He added 
that UAE Minister of State for Finance and Industry 
Khirbash was coordinating with his GCC counterparts on Iraq 
reconstruction.  According to Al-Nuami, GCC members 
understand the need to support Iraq politically, 
economically, and with regard to its security. 
 
¶7. (C) The UAE delegation will be lead by Minister of State 
for Finance and Industry Dr. Mohammed Khalfan bin Khirbash. 
It will include MFA Assistant Undersecretary for Political 
Affairs Abdullah Rashid Al-Nuami, a senior person from the 
Ministry of Economy and Commerce.  Representatives from the 
Abu Dhabi Fund for Development and the UAE Red Crescent 
will also attend the meetings as the UAE executive agents 
for development projects and humanitarian assistance 
respectively.
