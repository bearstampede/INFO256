¶1. (U) This is an action message. Please see para 3. 
 
¶2. (U) In June 2003, UAEG officals met with an 
interagency USG team in the UAE to develop a roadmap 
for EXBS training (reftel). The UAEG MFA has requested 
further information about the training programs 
scheduled to start in October 2003. They would like to 
know: 
 
¶I. Number of UAE participants permitted to attend the 
training sessions held either domestically or abroad. 
 
II. Number of UAE participants permitted to 
participate in the workshops either domestically or 
abroad. 
 
III. What facilities and materials does Washington 
require to hold training sessions in the UAE? 
 
IV.  Will the UAEG need to pay fees for the sessions? 
Who will bear expenses such as food, accommodation, 
transportation, and paying trainers' fees? 
 
¶3. (U) ACTION REQUESTED: Please advise on how to 
respond to the UAEG request.
