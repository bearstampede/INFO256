SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  IRAQ UAE PLAN 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  THE AFTERMATH OF THE ARAB SUMMIT AND THE UAE 
INITIATIVE ON IRAQ CONTINUED TO GENERATE EXTENSIVE COVERAGE IN 
THE LOCAL MEDIA.  NEWS REPORTING AND EDITORIALS PRAISED SHEIKH 
ZAYED'S PLAN AND CRITICIZED ARAB LEADERS' ATTITUDES TOWARDS IT. 
AN "AL ITTIHAD" EDITORIAL APPLAUDED THE UAE INITIATIVE AND 
DECLARED IT AS 'THE WISEST SOLUTION' FOR THE CURRENT CRISIS.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  NOTING THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN ARAB LEADERS DURING THE SUMMIT, 
SHARJAH-BASED PAN-ARAB "AL KHALEEJ" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/03: 
 
"... BEFORE COMPLAINING ABOUT OTHERS, ARAB COUNTRIES SHOULD 
RESOLVE ALL CONFLICTS BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND COVER UP ALL THE 
HOLES THAT ARE GROWING DEEPER AND WIDER.  THE (AMERICAN) POLICY 
OF DIVIDING THE ARABS WILL NOT WORK IF IT HAD NO GROUNDS, WHICH 
IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE ARAB REGION..." 
 
¶3.  COMMENTING ON THE UAE INITIATIVE PRESENTED TO THE ARAB 
SUMMIT, ABU DHABI-BASED SEMI-GOVERNMENT "AL-ITTIHAD" 
EDITORIALIZED ON 3/03: 
 
"... ANY THOROUGH AND OBJECTIVE READING OF THE UAE'S INITIATIVE 
WILL TREAT IT FAIRLY AND SHUT UP WHOEVER THINKS THAT THE UAE IS 
INTERFERING IN IRAQ'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS ... THIS INITIATIVE PLACED 
BEFORE EVERYONE, WITH NO EXCEPTIONS, THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES, 
ESPECIALLY THE IRAQI LEADERSHIP.  IT ALSO PROVIDES AN ARAB AND 
INTERNATIONAL SHIELD FOR A PEACEFUL BREAKTHROUGH THAT WILL SAVE 
THE SOULS OF MANY WHO ARE ON THE VERGE OF DESTRUCTION..." 
 
¶4.  DESCRIBING ARAB ATTITUDES TOWARD THE UAE INITIATIVE PRESENTED 
TO THE ARAB SUMMIT, ABU DHABI-BASED PAN-ARAB DAILY "AKHBAR AL 
ARAB" EDITORIALIZED ON 3/03: 
 
"... WHAT IS STRANGE IS THAT THE VIEWS PRESENTED IN THE UAE 
INITIATIVE REGARDING THE EXILE OF THE IRAQI REGIME AS THE FASTEST 
AND SHORTEST WAY OUT OF THIS CRISIS WERE NOT RECEIVED WITH THE 
ATTENTION THEY DESERVED ... THE ARABS HAVE LOST THEIR CHANCE TO 
IMPLEMENT THIS CHOICE, WHICH FOCUSES ON SOLVING THIS CRISIS WITH 
ARAB HANDS UNDER AN INTERNATIONAL UMBRELLA.  THIS WILL CUT THE 
MEANS FOR THE U.S. AND OTHERS FROM PLOTTING THE WORST SCENARIOS 
EVER AGAINST IRAQ AND THE REGION.  WHAT WE ARE AFRAID OF IS THAT 
SUCH SCENARIOS TURN INTO FACTS IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS, AND THEN NO 
'IF' WILL HELP."
