SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ:  UNDECIDED SIX INITIATIVE DEAD 
 
REF: USUN 699 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT; REASONS: 
 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
¶1. (C) CAMEROONIAN PERMREP BELINGA-EBOUTOU REPORTED THAT THE 
U-6 INITIATIVE TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT FOR THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL HAD HIT A DEAD END, BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF 
A MEETING BETWEEN U-6 PERMREPS EARLY AFTERNOON ON MARCH 14. 
CAMEROON, ANGOLA, GUINEA AND PAKISTAN HAD ALL DECLINED TO 
SUPPORT THE INITIATIVE FURTHER, BUT AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD 
CIRCULATE THE FINAL DOCUMENT WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE 
RECORD.  CHILEAN PERMREP VALDES REPORTED SEPARATELY TO 
AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE THAT THE SIX HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND 
A SUFFICIENT BRIDGE BETWEEN THE COMPETING POSITIONS IN THE 
COUNCIL. 
 
¶2. (U) THE TEXT OF THE FINAL U-6 PRODUCT FOLLOWS.  BEGIN TEXT. 
 
DRAFT PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT 
 
¶1. THE SECURITY COUNCIL RECALLS ITS RESOLUTION 687 (1991) AND 
OTHER RELEVANT RESOLUTIONS, PARTICULARLY RESOLUTIONS 1284 
(1999) AND 1441 (2002) WHICH ESTABLISHED AN ENHANCED SYSTEM 
OF INSPECTIONS BASED ON IMMEDIATE, ACTIVE, FULL AND 
UNCONDITIONAL COOPERATION OF IRAQ, TO COMPLETE VERIFIED 
DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ AND THE REPORTS OF THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN 
OF THE UNMOVIC AND IAEA ON JANUARY 27TH, FEBRUARY 14TH AND 
7TH, 2003. 
 
¶2. THE BRIEFINGS OF THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF UNMOVIC AND 
IAEA INDICATED PROGRESS IN THE DISARMAMENT PROCESS OF IRAQ 
AND UNDERLINED THAT RESULTS ARE STILL MODEST AND THE NEED FOR 
FURTHER ENDEAVORS TO COMPLETE VERIFIED DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE COUNCIL HAS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT 
INSPECTIONS CANNOT CONTINUE INDEFINITELY (THIS SITUATION 
CREATED DIFFERENT OPINIONS AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE SC ON HOW 
TO BEST ACHIEVE IRAQ'S DISARMAMENT.) THUS, THE COUNCIL WILL 
NEED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INSPECTIONS AS A MEANS 
TO OBTAIN, IN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME, THE COMPLETE AND 
VERIFIABLE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ. 
 
¶3. TO THIS END: 
 
ON THE BASIS OF THE RECENT REPORT OF CLUSTERS DECLASSIFIED BY 
UNMOVIC, THE COUNCIL HAS DECIDED WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE 
NEED FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF RES. 1441. THE COUNCIL 
DECIDES THAT: IRAQ SHOULD, NO LATER THAN (  ) AFTER THE 
ADOPTION OF THE PRESENT PRST, COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING 
IMMEDIATE DISARMAMENT TASKS: 
 
A) AUTHORIZATION TO INTERVIEW AT LEAST 30 SCIENTISTS 
IDENTIFIED BY UNMOVIC AND IAEA OUTSIDE IRAQ. 
B) DISCLOSURE OF ANY MUSTARD GAS FILLED SHELLS AND AERIAL 
BOMBS UNACCOUNTED FOR SINCE 1998 OR EVIDENCE OF THEIR 
DESTRUCTION AS DEMANDED BY THE INSPECTORS; 
C) DISCLOSE INFORMATION ON 10,000 LITERS OF ANTHRAX 
UNACCOUNTED FOR AS DEMANDED BY THE INSPECTORS; 
D) DESTROY ALL AL SAMOUD MISSILES AND COMPONENTS, INCLUDING

COMPONENTS DESIGNED FOR THE PRODUCTION AND TESTING OF AL 
SAMOUD 2 MISSILES. 
E) PROVIDE FULL DOCUMENTATION ON THE PURPOSE OF THE REMOTELY 
PILOTED VEHICLES (RPVS). 
F) ADOPT LEGISLATION PROHIBITING THE WMD PRODUCTION AND 
RELATED ACTIVITIES FOR ALL IRAQI GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL AND 
CITIZENS IMMEDIATELY; 
 
(IN ANY CASE, AND AS A STARTING POINT OF THIS INITIATIVE, THE 
LEADERSHIP OF IRAQ MUST WRITE A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE 
SECRETARY-GENERAL AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL, 
INDICATING THAT IRAQ WILL WITHOUT DELAY YIELD TO UNMOVIC AND 
IAEA FOR DESTRUCTION OF ALL REMAINING PROHIBITED WEAPONS, 
PROSCRIBED ITEMS AND RELATED DOCUMENTATION IN DATA. IRAQ WILL 
FULLY COOPERATE WITH UNMOVIC AND IAEA IN IMMEDIATELY 
ADDRESSING AND RESOLVING ALL OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS. THE 
LETTER SHOULD ALSO INDICATE THE APPROPRIATE MEANS TO BE USED 
SO THAT THE FOLLOWING BECOMES THE DUTY OF ALL IRAQI 
GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL AND CITIZENS IMMEDIATELY: 
 
-TO CEASE ANY PROSCRIBED ACTIVITY 
-TO HAND OVER ANY PROSCRIBED ITEMS OR DOCUMENTATION AND DATA 
ABOUT SUCH ITEMS IN THEIR POSSESSION TO UNMOVIC AND IAEA.) 
 
¶4. UPON EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD ...., THE INSPECTORS WILL 
PRESENT A FACTUAL AND DETAILED REPORT ON THE COMPLETION OF 
THE DISARMAMENT TASKS MENTIONED IN PARAGRAPH 3. THE COUNCIL 
WILL THEN ASSESS THE SITUATION AND DECIDE THE CONTINUATION OF 
THE INSPECTIONS PROCESS ON THE BASIS OF A PROGRAM OF WORK TO 
BE SUBMITTED BY THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF UNMOVIC AND IAEA OR 
APPLY THE APPROPRIATE RELEVANT PARAGRAPH OF 1441. 
 
¶5. THE COUNCIL OFFERS FULL PROTECTION FOR ALL IRAQI OFFICIALS 
WHO EXTEND THEIR UNEQUIVOCAL COOPERATION TO UNMOVIC AND IAEA 
AND OTHER UN AGENCIES AND TO THE UNSC TO SECURE FULL AND 
FAITHFUL COMPLIANCE BY IRAQ WITH THE ABOVE MENTIONED 
OBLIGATIONS AND ASSURES THEM OF SECURITY FOR THEIR PERSON AND 
THEIR FAMILIES. 
 
¶6. WITHIN THE TIME FRAME MENTIONED IN PARAGRAPH ... THE 
COUNCIL WILL CONTINUE INTENSE DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE 
IRAQ'S COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS STATEMENT. 
 
¶7. THE COUNCIL SHALL REMAIN SEIZED OF THE MATTER. 
 
END TEXT.
