SUBJECT: APPROACHING UAEG ON FUNDS FOR ABORTED 
IRAQ ARMS DEAL ON HOLD IN DUBAI 
 
REF:  STATE 122946 
 
¶1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE RICHARD A. ALBRIGHT 
FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶2.  (S)  The sensitivity of reftel demarche, 
particularly the involvement of the prominent 
Lootah family (whether knowingly or otherwise) in 
the matter, will require that we engage at the 
highest levels of the UAEG.  Since this is 
primarily a government-to-government issue, we 
will seek an appointment with de facto Foreign 
Minister Hamdan bin Zayid (our primary federal 
contact on policy-level terrorist financing 
matters), but can anticipate that he will have 
several questions which we would like to be able 
to answer.  We would note that a direct USG to 
Dubai Emirate communication on this matter would 
not/not be recommended absent prior notification 
to, and approval of, the federal authorities in 
Abu Dhabi. 
 
¶3.  (S)  First and foremost, what are the 
intentions of the USG with regards to the funds? 
Will we seek their forfeiture to us and if so, 
will we be able to "vest" them to ensure that 
these monies are returned to the Iraqi people (as 
opposed to the general treasury of the USG)?  What 
would be the modalities through which we would 
take this legal action and communicate it to the 
UAEG?  Secondly, are we prepared to agree to hold 
blameless UAE actors or entities whose involvement 
in the matter may be confirmed by the records we 
are seeking to have turned over to us by the UAEG? 
(Note:  This matter has arisen in the past in FBI 
investigations and we have been able to provide 
assurances to the Central Bank of the UAE that it 
was not our intention to pursue UAE financial 
institutions; if we found strong evidence of 
wrongdoing we would provide that information to 
the appropriate UAE authorities for their 
consideration.  We advise that a similar 
undertaking be provided in this matter in order to 
facilitate provision of the documents we desire. 
End note.) 
 
¶4.  (S)  Post would appreciate a quick response to 
the above questions so that we may approach MFA 
Minstate Hamdan at the earliest opportunity. 
 
¶5.  (U)  This message coordinated with Amconsul 
Dubai.
