(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch, reasons 1.5, b/d. 
 
 
¶1. (C) Subsequent to receiving clarification from the 
Department that resolutions described in Refs D and E were in 
fact the same resolution, MFA Disarmament Head of Department 
Bulent Meric reiterated to PolMilOff Sept. 8 that Turkey's 
position on the Iran resolution was the same as the EU's. 
PolMilOff noted to Meric, per ref C, that our mission in 
Vienna had the impression that the Turkish delegation was not 
being supportive of the resolution El Baradei himself had 
supported. 
 
 
¶2. (C) Upon delivery of the points in Ref B Sept. 9, Meric 
reaffirmed that there should be no light between Turkey's 
position on the Iranian resolution and that of the EU.  He 
assured PolMilOff that after the previous day's conversation, 
Ankara had sent instructions to its delegation in Vienna to 
be more cooperative and clear on Turkey's support.  Meric 
said "there should be no problem." 
 
 
¶3. (C) Comment: We understand from UNVienna that the Turks 
may have been uncertain as to the relationship between the 
resolutions in Refs D and E.  Now that the Turks understand 
that we and the EU are on the same side, we expect UNVienna 
will see greater support from the Turkish del.
