¶1.  SUMMARY:  USAID/OFDA ASIA REGIONAL ADVISOR TRAVELED TO 
SRI LANKA FROM MAY 21-25 TO ASSIST THE MISSION WITH 
RESPONSE TO THE FLOOD DISASTER.  SHE TRAVELED WITH 
USAID/SRI LANKA MISSION DISASTER RELIEF OFFICER (MDRO) TO 
THE WORST HIT DISTRICTS IN SOUTHWESTERN SRI LANKA.  WHILE 
THE FLOODWATERS HAVE RECEDED IN MANY OF THE AREAS AT 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS, WATER LEVELS REMAIN HIGH OR HAVE RISEN 
IN SOME OF THE LOW LYING AREAS. AS ROAD ACCESS TO MOST 
AREAS IMPROVES, FOOD AND OTHER RELIEF ITEMS ARE BEING 
DISTRIBUTED TO AFFECTED FAMILIES. CROP DAMAGE AS A RESULT 
OF THE FLOODS MAY RESULT IN A MID-TERM SHORTFALL IN 
FOODSTOCKS, PARTICULARLY FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE 
POPULATIONS.  PROVISION OF CLEAN WATER IS THE HIGHEST 
PRIORITY NEED AT THIS TIME.  OFDA REGIONAL ADVISOR 
RECOMMENDS OFDA/WASHINGTON CONSIDER PROVIDING ADDITIONAL 
FUNDS FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO THE FLOODS, FOCUSING ON 
THE WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR, PENDING RECEIPT AND 
APPROVAL OF FORTHCOMING PROPOSAL.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  BACKGROUND:  PER REF A, HEAVY RAINS HAVE AFFECTED THE 
WESTERN, SOUTHERN AND SABARAGAMUWA PROVINCES OF SRI LANKA 
RESULTING IN FLOODING AND LANDSLIDES IN KALUTARA, 
RATNAPURA, GALLE AND MATARA DISTRICTS.  THE UNUSUALLY 
HEAVY RAINS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEASONAL MONSOON; 
HOWEVER, THE SITUATION HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY CYCLONIC 
ACTIVITY IN THE BAY OF BENGAL. 
 
¶3.  USAID/OFDA ASIA REGIONAL ADVISOR MARIZA ROGERS TRAVELED 
TO COLOMBO MAY 21-25, 2003 TO ASSIST THE USAID MISSION 
WITH THE FLOOD AND LANDSLIDE DISASTER IN THE SOUTHWESTERN 
REGION OF SRI LANKA.  SHE WAS JOINED BY USAID/SRI LANKA 
MDRO JESSICA DAVEY FOR COORDINATION MEETINGS IN COLOMBO 
AND ASSESSMENTS IN THE DISTRICTS OF RATNAPURA, GALLE, 
MATARA AND KALUTARA IN THREE SOUTHWESTERN PROVINCES OF SRI 
LANKA. 
 
¶4.  CURRENT SITUATION:  THE GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA (GSL) 
CRISIS MANAGEMENT CENTER WITHIN THE PRIME MINISTER'S 
OFFICE HAS BEEN COLLECTING AND UPDATING THE FIGURES 
CONCERNING THIS DISASTER FROM POLICE REPORTS, RELIEF 
WORKERS AND THE GOVERNMENT AGENTS IN THE AFFECTED 
DISTRICTS.  AS OF MAY 27, 2003, THE GSL REPORTS: 151,141 
FAMILIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED; 250 DEATHS HAVE BEEN 
CONFIRMED; 24,365 HOUSES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED AND 22,073 
HOMES HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY DAMAGED. WHILE FLOOD WATERS 
REMAIN STANDING IN SOME DISTRICTS, ROAD ACCESS AND THE 
REQUIRED ROAD CLEARANCE CONTINUE TO BE THE GREATEST 
OBSTACLES TO DISTRIBUTION OF RELEIF IN THOSE AREAS. THE 
METEOROLOGY DEPARTMENT HAS FORECAST MORE RAIN IN THE 
AFFECTED AREAS AS PART OF THE SEASONAL MONSOON. 
METEROLOGISTS ARE MONITORING THE EXISTING CONDITIONS, 
FAVOURABLE FOR CYCLONES IN THE BAY OF BENGAL. 
 
¶5.  RESPONSE TO DATE:  PER REF B, THE USG PROVIDED 
IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE SRI LANKA RED CROSS WITH 
A GRANT OF US$50,000 FOR RELIEF SUPPLIES FOR APPROXIMATELY 
10,000 PEOPLE.  THE SUPPLIES WILL BE PROVIDED TO FAMILIES 
WHOSE HOMES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, OR THOSE WHO LOST MOST OF 
THEIR HOUSEHOLD BELONGINGS AS A RESULT OF THE FLOOD.  THE 
RELIEF ITEMS INCLUDE BED SHEETS, COOKING SETS, SLEEPING 
MATS, LANTERNS, BUCKETS, SOAP, AND BOTTLED WATER.  THESE 
LOCALLY PROCURED ITEMS ARE CURRENTLY BEING PACKAGED AS 
KITS BY RED CROSS VOLUNTEERS, AND WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO 
THE AFFECTED FAMILIES SHORTLY.  IN ADDITION, PART OF THE 
FUNDS WILL SUPPORT THE CLEANING AND REPAIR OF 100 WATER 
WELLS IN THE AFFECTED AREAS. 
 
¶6.  AS OF MAY 26, 2003, DONOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE RELIEF 
EFFORTS AMOUNT TO MORE THAN US$ 2 MILLION ACCORDING TO 
RELIEFWEB (WWW.RELIEFWEB.ORG).  DONOR COUNTRIES INCLUDE 
JAPAN, NORWAY, AUSTRALIA, THE EUROPEAN UNION, CANADA, 
INDIA AND SWEDEN. 
 
¶7.  RELIEF COORDINATION:  THE LEAD MINISTRY FOR COORDINATION 
OF DISASTER RESPONSE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL IS THE MINISTRY 
OF POWER AND ENERGY; AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL, THE MINISTRY 
OF SOCIAL WELFARE HAS ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 
RESPONSE.  AN OPERATIONS CENTER HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED 
WITHIN THE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE, WHERE INFORMATION ON 
CASUALTIES, DAMAGES AND NEEDS ARE BEING COLLECTED.  THE UN 
AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THE RESPONSE INCLUDE U.N. HIGH 
COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES (UNHCR), WORLD FOOD PROGRAM 
(WFP), UNICEF, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO), AND UN 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (UNDP).  THE UN OFFICE FOR 
COORDINATION OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE (OCHA) HAS FIELDED 
ASSESSMENT TEAMS AND ALSO PROVIDED UN VOLUNTEERS TO ASSIST 
WITH COORDINATION OF RELIEF ACTIVITIES AT THE DISTRICT 
LEVEL.  CURRENTLY, THERE ARE NO INTERNATIONAL NGOS WORKING 
IN THE AFFECTED AREAS, AND ONLY A FEW LOCAL COMMUNITY- 
BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE OPERATIONAL. 
 
¶8.  RATNAPURA DISTRICT ASSESSMENT:  ON MAY 23, THE TEAM 
VISITED RATNAPURA DISTRICT AND OBSERVED VARYING DEGREES OF 
RECOVERY; WITHIN RATNAPURA TOWN THE ELECTRICITY HAD BEEN 
RESTORED, AND FAMILIES WERE SHOVELING THE MUD AND DEBRIS 
FROM THEIR HOMES; CLOTHES, FURNITURE AND SCHOOL BOOKS WERE 
LAID OUT TO DRY ALONGSIDE THE ROADS. HOWEVER, BEYOND THE 
MUNICIPALITY LIMITS, ROAD CLEARANCE AND REPAIR WAS 
CONTINUING; MORE HOMES WERE PARTIALLY DAMAGED OR 
DESTROYED, AND MANY PADDY FIELDS WERE WASHED AWAY.  THE 
TEAM ATTEMPTED TO REACH A VILLAGE WHERE LOCALS REPORTED 
THAT 40 OUT OF 75  FAMILIES WERE BURIED BY A LANDSLIDE. 
HOWEVER, THE ROAD WAS TOO HEAVILY DAMAGED AND THE VILLAGE 
COULD ONLY BE ACCESSED ON FOOT - ANOTHER 5 KILOMETERS 
WALK.  ACCORDING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, LIMITED 
RELIEF SUPPLIES FOR THE VILLAGERS HAD BEEN AIRDROPPED BY 
MILITARY HELICOPTERS.  THERE WERE MANY REPORTS OF SUCH 
ISOLATED AREAS AND SITUATIONS ALL OVER THE DISTRICT. 
 
¶9.  KALUTARA AND GALLE DISTRICTS ASSESMENT:  ON MAY 23 AND 
24, THE TEAM VISITED KALUTARA AND GALLE DISTRICTS, AND 
OBSERVED A SIMILAR RETURN TO NORMALCY IN THE LARGER TOWNS. 
HOWEVER, THE TEAM NOTED THAT STANDING WATER AND RESIDUAL 
MUD REMAINED IN MORE AREAS OF THESE DISTRICTS. WHILE FLOOD 
WATERS IN THE HILL AREAS HAVE MOSTLY RECEDED, THE WATER 
LEVELS IN THE LOWER LYING AREAS HAVE RISEN.  THE EXISTING 
BUNDS IN THESE DISTRICTS HAVE BUFFERED SOME HOMES FROM THE 
EFFECTS OF THE FLOOD, BUT APPEAR TO HAVE WORSENED THE 
IMPACT IN OTHER AREAS.  IN EACH OF THE DISTRICTS, THE TEAM 
SPOKE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SRI LANKA RED CROSS, 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENTS, AND THOSE DISPLACED FAMILIES, NOW 
EVACUATED TO SCHOOLS, TEMPLES AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS. 
 
¶10.  NEEDS:  ACCORDING TO THE UN, THE RED CROSS AND 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, FOOD IS NOT AN URGENT REQUIREMENT AT 
THIS TIME.  IN ADDITION TO PREPARED FOOD AND DRY RATIONS 
PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE SECTOR BUSINESSES, AND 
THE GENERAL PUBLIC, WFP HAS DIVERTED SOME OF ITS 
FOODSTOCKS TO THE FLOOD-AFFECTED AREAS.  FLOOD-RELATED 
CROP DAMAGE MAY RESULT IN SOME MID-TERM SHORTFALL IN 
FOODSTOCKS, PARTICULARLY FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE 
POPULATIONS; THE FOOD SECURITY SITUATION MAY REQUIRE 
MONITORING.  NON-FOOD RELIEF ITEMS ARE BEING PROVIDED 
THROUGH GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR DONATIONS, WHILE THE 
UN HAS PROVIDED ITEMS FROM ITS OWN STOCKPILE. 
 
¶11.  PROVISION OF CLEAN WATER IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AT 
THIS TIME.  MOST OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNAL WELLS 
REMAIN FLOODED.  IN THE AREAS WHERE THE WATER HAS RECEDED, 
THE WELLS HAVE SUSTAINED STRUCTURAL DAMAGE, AND THE WATER 
IS CONTAMINATED BY SEDIMENT AND DEBRIS.  DRINKING WATER IS 
BEING DELIVERED BY LORRY AND TRACTOR MOUNTED BOWSERS TO 
AREAS ALONG AND NEAR THE MAJOR ROADS; OUTLYING AREAS ARE 
DEPENDENT UPON DISTRIBUTION OF BOTTLED WATER.  WHILE THERE 
IS CONCERN ABOUT WATER-BORNE DISEASES, THERE ARE NO 
CONCLUSIVE REPORTS OF INCREASED INCIDENCE. 
 
¶12.  RECOMMENDATION:  THE EMERGENCY PROVISION OF CLEAN WATER 
IS NEEDED TO PROTECT THE HEALTH STATUS OF PEOPLE IN THE 
FLOOD-AFFECTED AREAS.  OFDA REGIONAL ADVISOR RECOMMENDS 
THAT OFDA/WASHINGTON CONSIDER PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS 
FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO THE FLOODS, FOCUSING ON THE 
WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR, PENDING RECEIPT AND APPROVAL 
OF FORTHCOMING PROPOSAL.
