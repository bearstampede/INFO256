SUBJECT:  GOT Intends to Participate in Kimberley 
Process 
 
 
Ref:  State 208989 
 
 
Oya Karakas, MFA Head of Department for Multilateral 
Economic Affairs, told Econoff July 22 that the GOT 
intends to participate in the Kimberley Process 
governing trade in rough diamonds (reftel).  However, it 
has not completed domestic procedures necessary to 
implement the Process' certification scheme, which may 
require a Council of Ministers decree or new 
legislation.  Neither measure will be implemented before 
the July 31 end of the "period of tolerance".  Econoff 
encouraged Karakas to communicate Turkey's intentions to 
the Kimberley Process Chair, and Karakas agreed to do 
this. Deutsch
