Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d) 
 
(C)   Post has confirmed that Canada has taken the following 
action with respect to the three instruments discussed reftel: 
-the protocol on children in armed conflict was ratified by 
Canada on July 7, 2000; 
-ILO Convention No. 182 on the worst forms of child labor was 
ratified by Canada on June 6, 2000; 
-the protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography has not yet been ratified by Canada. 
Gillian Blackell, Legal Counsel in the Family, Children and 
Youth Section of Canada's Justice Ministry, told us that the 
government of Canada does intend to ratify this protocol and 
hopes to complete the ratification process by fall 2003. The 
federal government must complete consultations with Canada's 
provincial governments, and with representatives of Canada's 
First Nations, concerning the implications of the protocol.
