¶1.  (U) Classified by A/DCM Tom Williams, for reasons 1.5 
(B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C) Acting DCM and Econchief met with Mohammed Al- 
Ghaith, the Director General of the UAE General Civil 
Aviation Authority on June 29.  In the course of the 
conversation, Ghaith noted that Emirates Airlines had 
approached him about passenger flights to Baghdad, but he 
had told them that this was premature.  The airport is 
still closed and the security situation is too unstable. 
He noted that there are a number of steps that must be 
taken to reopen the airport and to reestablish passenger 
flights to Baghdad.  In his view, it will be 3 to 6 months 
before he would be comfortable authorizing passenger 
flights to Baghdad.  He also noted that Emirates Airlines 
was not pushing him to speed up the process. 
 
¶3. (U) In a separate meeting, the MFA asked about the steps 
Gulf Air needs to take to fly passenger flights to Baghdad 
as soon as the airport opens.  Post passed the MFA and 
Civil Aviation Authority the text of Secretary Powell's 
letter to Bahraini Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Mubarak 
al-Khalifa.
