His Excellency, 
Mr. George W. Bush,

Washington D.C., USA 
 
 
Dear President, 
 
 
  CONDOLENCE MESSAGE 
 
 
 The people and Government of Nigeria share 
your deep feeling of loss and sadness at the tragedy 
of the Columbia Shuttle. 
 
 
 The five men and two women astronauts represent 
not just for America, but for the entire world, the 
unrelenting efforts to serve mankind through the 
conquest of visible and invisible frontiers.  They 
gave, so that the world can continue to gain. 
 
 
 Please convey to their families the deep sorrow 
felt by Nigerians at this tragedy which I am sure will 
be unraveled, and which will not stop the progress of 
the American Space Programme. 
 
 
 Nigerians are with you at this hour and the 
Good Lord will console you and the families of the 
departed astronauts. 
 
 
    Yours sorrowfully, 
 
 
    (Signed) O Obasanjo 
    OLUSEGUN OBASANJO
