SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION G8 SUMMIT; HARARE 
 
  ¶1.   Under headline "Africa should adopt one position on 
      G8" the independent weekly "The Business Tribune" dedicated 
      its June 12 editorial to criticizing the G8 for failing to 
      meet their obligations to Africa at the just-ended summit 
      in Evian, France.  Stating: "Africa must remain on the 
      agenda of the G8 until these obligations are fulfilled." 
      Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .The 2003 G8 was ultimately a disaster for 
      African farmers.  It failed to adopt even limited proposals 
      for a moratorium on reducing European and American tariff 
      duties and subsidies for U. S. and European agriculture. 
      These policies are perverse.  While millions of African 
      farmers, mostly women's livelihoods, are ruined by these 
      policies, European livestock is ensured major state 
      subsidies. . .Without a change in world trade rules, 
      the rhetoric of ensuring a fresh start for Africa 
      would not translate into meaningful action or a new 
      partnership for Africa.  African leaders and 
      citizens were urged to take forward the initiative 
      and the primary responsibility for resolving 
      Africa's development crises. . .Despite the failure 
      of Evian, the G8 continues to have outstanding 
      obligations and commitments to Africa.  For this 
      reason, Africa must remain on the agenda of the G8 
      until these obligations are fulfilled."
