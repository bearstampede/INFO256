START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Post has been quite successful and confident with media 
coverage of numerous events with MTV and Sirasa 
TV/Radio. 
Sirasa TV is an independent channel managed by Maharaja 
Broadcasting Corporation.  Its newscast may be called 
the trend setting local language telecast with 17 news 
bulletins daily.  Sirasa TV makes a good effort to give 
unbiased information to listeners and is an extremely 
popular independent television station in Sri Lanka. 
It broadcasts mainly in Sinhala, the language used by a 
majority of Sri Lankans. 
Asoka's career development record is proof of his 
potential.  He began his media career as a freelance 
journalist and joined Maharaja Broadcasting Corporation 
for Sirasa radio at a later stage.  He was also the 
first local news editor at a private sector radio 
station in Sri Lanka.  Currently, he is the main news 
Director for both Sirasa TV and Sirasa radio.
