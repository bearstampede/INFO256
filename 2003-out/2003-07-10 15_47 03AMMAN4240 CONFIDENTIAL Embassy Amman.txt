SUBJECT: FORMER GID HEAD CONVICTED IN BANK SCANDAL CASE 
 
REF: A. AMMAN 00687 B. AMMAN 00794 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) Former General Intelligence Directorate (GID) head 
Samih Battikhi was sentenced to 8 years in prison on July 10 
after being convicted of fraud and forgery charges, which 
stem from a bank fraud scandal associated with Jordanian 
businessman Majd Shamayleh (see reftels).  One Embassy source 
said that when current GID head Sa'ad Kheir ratified the 
court's judgment, he reduced Battikhi's prison sentence to 
four years.  GOJ prosecutors told the specially-convened 
military tribunal that Battikhi had embezzled JD 17 million. 
At least some of Battikhi's assets have been seized by the 
GOJ. 
 
¶2. (C) Prosecuting Battikhi serves the dual purpose of 
highlighting the GOJ's anti-corruption efforts while 
underscoring to the public that no one is above the law, 
including former senior GOJ officials.  Although the King may 
issue a royal pardon to Battikhi before he serves out his 
sentence, the message--which was generally well-received by 
the public--has been made.
