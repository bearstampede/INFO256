CONFORMITY CERTIFICATION PROGRAM 
 
REF: A) USDOC 3249, B) STATE 0164, C) KUWAIT 422 
 
¶1. This is an action request.  Please see para. 4 
 
¶2. On July 1, the Ambassador sent a letter to Minister of 
State for Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan 
and to Minister of Economy and Commerce Sheikh Fahim Al- 
Qassimi to express our concern about the GCC decision to 
implement a conformity assessment program for foreign 
imports similar to Saudi Arabia's International Conformity 
Certification Program (ICCP).  The Ambassador stressed our 
belief that the program may contradict the UAE's WTO 
obligations and that it might complicate the UAE's interest 
in concluding a Free Trade agreement with the U.S.  She 
also asked that the UAE delay implementing this decision 
until USG experts could discuss concerns with the UAEG in 
more detail. 
 
¶3. Acting DCM and Econ Chief made the same points in a 
meeting with Ministry of Finance Assistant Undersecretary 
Khalid Al Bustani on June 29. Al-Bustani stressed that the 
UAE would not impose one set of standards on imports and 
another set of standards on domestically manufactured 
products.  He noted, however, that the UAE needed to set 
standards and that it did not have the resources to create 
a set of standards on its own but would adopt GCC wide 
standards.  He asked for more detailed information on 
specific problems with the standards themselves. 
 
¶4. Action Request:  Please provide post with more 
information on specific USG objections to the standards 
that we can pass to UAE standards experts.  End Action 
Request.
