SUBJECT: GOT PLANS TO SEND ONLY GENEVA-BASED 
REPRESENTATIVES TO SWISS CONFERENCE ON IRAQ 
 
 
REF: STATE 35667 
 
 
Classified by Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Scot Marciel for

(C) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on the USG's decision 
not to participate in the February 15-16 Swiss conference on 
international humanitarian planning to Feza Ozturk, MFA Head 
of Department for International Political Organizations, on 
February 7.  Ozturk agreed that the Swiss conference might 
not be productive, as it appears to have been 
hastily-organized and will likely coincide with a UNSC 
session on Iraq.  However, he said the GOT would probably 
send Geneva-based representatives to the meeting, unless 
other governments from the region decided not to attend. 
Ozturk said it was virtually certain that no Ankara-based 
representatives would travel to Geneva for the conference.
