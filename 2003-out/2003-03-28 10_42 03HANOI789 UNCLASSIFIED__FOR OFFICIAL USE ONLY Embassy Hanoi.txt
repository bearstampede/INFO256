SUBJECT: WGSARS:  Vietnamese Medical Situation - Update 3/28 
 
REF: Hanoi 768 
 
¶1.  (U) To our knowledge, no new SARS cases were reported on 
March 28 (but Mission was unable to get a hold of WHO in Hanoi by 
COB today to verify this information).  The French Hospital 
discharged another four persons on the evening of March 27 for a 
total of 13 cases discharged since the beginning of the outbreak. 
 
¶2.  (U) The Australian Embassy reports that it is providing 
prospective travelers to Vietnam with information from the World 
Health Organization's website and is advising that Australians 
concerned at the risks presented by SARS in certain countries 
should reconsider their need to travel.  Denmark and the United 
Kingdom also are providing information based on the WHO website. 
The Canadian Embassy provides SARS information from its Health 
Canada website.  The French Embassy is sending out warden 
messages almost everyday and is also posting information on its 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.  The Czech Republic's 
Embassy is advising Czech citizens to defer all non-essential 
travel to Vietnam and is cautioning about secondary effects due 
to the reduction of available medical facilities in Hanoi. 
 
¶3.  (U) In our message to non-official American citizen wardens 
on March 17, Mission advised that American citizens should avoid 
visiting hospitals or clinics.  We no longer believe this 
precaution is necessary.  Clinics have instituted careful 
screening procedures to separate any potential SARS cases from 
the general population in waiting rooms.  In addition, barring a 
new introduction of SARS from outside of Vietnam, it appears that 
SARS continues to be confined to the health care community in 
Vietnam.
