SUBJECT:  UAE INTERESTED IN JOINING IRAQ "CORE" 
GROUP IN PRINCIPLE 
 
REF:  A) State 80809; B) ABU DHABI 1508 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (S) The Ambassador followed-up on reftel demarche 
with MFA Minstate Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayid Al-Nahyan 
on April 6 (other topics covered septel).  Hamdan 
indicated that, in principle, the UAE would be 
interested in participating in the Core Group 
process, given the Emiratis' expertise in delivering 
humanitarian and reconstruction assistance and its 
contributions to the coalition.  Shaykh Hamdan would 
like more information about how the Core Group 
expects to function and its composition.  He noted 
that the UAE would expect a role for the Iraqis 
themselves.  While the UAE would channel private, 
unofficial (i.e. Red Crescent) humanitarian 
assistance purely on a bilateral basis, Hamdan said 
the UAEG would be available to offer advice, based 
on the Emiratis' knowledge of Iraq, and to 
coordinate on a multilateral basis for official, 
government-funded reconstruction efforts.  He 
carefully noted that we should not expect the UAEG 
to make a major financial donation, but they would 
certainly be a participant in the multilateral 
effort.
