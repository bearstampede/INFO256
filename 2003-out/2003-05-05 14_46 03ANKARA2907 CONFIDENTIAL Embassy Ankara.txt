(U)  Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request.  Please see para 3. 
 
 
¶2.  (C)  On May 3, DCM delivered ref A talking points to MFA 
DG for Middle East Affairs Tahsin Burcuoglu on the CENTCOM 
agreement to allow countries to send small security teams to 
guard diplomatic properties in Iraq.  DCM conveyed the point 
that at this time CENTCOM would not permit other diplomatic 
or technical personnel to enter Iraq.  Burcuoglu, noting that 
several other countries had already sent in diplomatic 
personnel and set up missions, said that Turkey plans to 
enter Iraq on May 12, via Jordan, to re-establish its 
diplomatic mission.  He said that Turkey's 4/30 National 
Security Council (NSC) had made this recommendation. 
Furthermore, Burcuoglu said that while Turkey would prefer to 
enter Iraq through the Habur Gate, it is currently planning 
to send its staff via Jordan.  Burcuoglu indicated that the 
GOT would be using Iraqi-registered cars (registered before 
the start of the war) to enter the country and that Ankara 
would provide the USG with the names and passport numbers of 
the personnel as well as license plates and travel plans 
before crossing the border. 
 
 
¶3.  (C)  Action request:  We note that ref C confirms 
Burcuoglu's claim that a number of countries have returned 
staff to Baghdad.  Since the GOT has already decided to 
proceed, we second Amman's request for information on how the 
process of border control and authorization (in the absence 
of LNO's at CENTCOM) should proceed.
