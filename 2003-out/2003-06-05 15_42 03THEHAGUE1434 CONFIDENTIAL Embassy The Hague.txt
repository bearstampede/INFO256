 (C) POLMILOFF MADE REFTEL DEMARCHE TO DUTCH MFA 
NONPROLIFERATION DIRECTOR PAUL WILKE ON JUNE 5.  WILKE SAID 
THAT THE GONL HAD INSTRUCTED ITS MISSION IN VIENNA TO 
DEMARCHE DG ELBARADEI URGING FULL TRANSPARENCY IN HIS 
UPCOMING REPORT, INCLUDING A LIST OF UNANSWERED IAEA 
QUESTIONS, NOT SIMPLY THOSE THAT IRAN HAS ANSWERED. 
APPARENTLY ELBARADEI SAID HE WOULD TAKE THESE CONCERNS INTO 
ACCOUNT.  THE DUTCH ARE INSISTING ON A STRONG EU STATEMENT AT 
THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS MEETING AND WILL CONTEMPLATE MAKING 
THEIR OWN ROBUST STATEMENT IF SUCH AN EU STATEMENT IS NOT 
FORTHCOMING.  WILKE SAID THE GONL'S SENSE IS THAT THERE IS 
GROWING SENTIMENT WITHIN EU CIRCLES FOR TAKING A HARD LINE. 
THE DUTCH ALSO WILL CONSIDER RAISING THIS ISSUE WITH 
"SKEPTICAL" BOARD STATES.
