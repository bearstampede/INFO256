CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC MINISTER COUNSELOR SCOTT KILNER FOR REASONS 1.5 
 (B) AND (D) 
 
1.(C) EST COUNSELOR DISCUSSED REFTEL POINTS WITH TRANSPORT 
MINISTRY FOREIGN AFFAIRS ADVISOR EMILIO MARAINI ON SEPTEMBER 
¶29.  MARAINI HAS LONG BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT GALILEO AND THE 
SECURITY ISSUES THE PROJECT RAISES. HE WAS PRESENT AT A U.S. 
CLASSIFIED BRIEFING IN BRUSSELS EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT, IN 
HIS WORDS, "RAISED SERIOUS SECURITY CONCERNS."  A BRIEF 
CONVERSATION WITH HILBRECHT AFTER THE LONDON BRIEFING HAD 
RAISED HIS HOPES THAT THESE CONCERNS WERE BEING 
SATISFACTORILY ADDRESSED, BUT MARAINI IS NOW LESS OPTIMISTIC 
AFTER THE FORMAL INTRA-EU BRIEFING ON THE LONDON DISCUSSIONS. 
 MARAINI STRESSED, AS HE HAS REPEATEDLY, THAT THE FINAL 
DECISION ON GALILEO AND U.S. CONCERNS MUST AND WILL BE MADE 
BY  EU HEADS OF GOVERNMENT, WITH ITALY'S POSITION DETERMINED 
BY PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI. 
 
¶2. (SBU) POL-MIL OFFICER ALSO DELIVERED POINTS TO MFA NATO 
AFFAIRS OFFICE DIRECTOR  GIOVANNI BRAUZZI AND MOD DIPLOMATIC 
ADVISOR FRANCESCO TRUPIANO, BOTH OF WHOM HAD LITTLE TO ADD. 
 
¶3.  (C) COMMENT:  SENIOR ITALIAN OFFICIALS STILL SEEM TO BE 
PINNING THEIR HOPES FOR A SOLUTION ON A TECHNICAL FIX.  AT 
THE SAME TIME, MANY ARE FINALLY WAKING UP TO THE FACT THAT 
THE CULMINATING ACT OF ITALY'S EU PRESIDENCY COULD BE A MAJOR 
TRANSATLANTIC TRAIN WRECK OVER GALILEO/M-CODE.  EMBASSY 
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO ELEVATE THIS TO THE POLITICAL LEVEL 
IN ITALY WILL BE SENT SEPTEL.
