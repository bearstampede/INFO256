SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST:  NEPALESE PARTY LEADER INVITED TO 
NORTH KOREA; OFFERS TO WORK WITH THE USG 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Michael E. Malinowski for reasons 1.5 (b) and 
 (d). 
 
¶1.  (S/NF) On August 1, Pashupati SJB Rana, Chairman of 
Nepal's National Democratic Party (RPP), reported to the 
Ambassador that he has been invited to travel to North Korea 
by its Ambassador to Nepal, Jon Son Myong.  Rana offered to 
deliver points that align with U.S. policy, and he is willing 
to meet with persons of interest to the USG.  Post will 
provide Rana with publicly available background information 
on North Korea and U.S. policy and suggests that the 
Department may wish to provide more specific information. 
 
Comment and Action Request 
=========================== 
 
¶2.  (S/NF) Rana has been for years a valuable contact who, 
Post believes, could serve as a useful source of information 
on North Korea and a reliable conduit for messages that 
reinforce U.S. policy.  The Department may wish to take 
advantage of this opportunity by providing talking points 
that reinforce U.S. policies of democracy and free market 
economy, a list of desired contacts, and subjects of interest. 
 
Biographic Information 
======================= 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Pashupati SJB Rana was elected Chairman of the 
Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), translated as the National 
Democratic Party, on December 14, 2002 for a four-year term. 
Rana served as the Water Resources Minister from September 
12, 1995 to April 1998, where he actively promoted private 
sector development of Nepal's many rivers.  Grandson of the 
last hereditary Rana Prime Minister, Mohan Shumshere, Rana 
comes from a wealthy and privileged family.  He was the chief 
player in negotiating the much despised Mahakali Treaty with 
India, which lead to the collapse of the 1996 Communist-led 
coalition government. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Rana has held prominent positions since the 
Panchayat era--a period (1960-90) in Nepal's political 
history when the King appointed members to a hierarchy of 
quasi-democratic councils.  He began his government career in 
1964 as a Joint Secretary in the Panchayat's Research and 
Training Section.  He later rose to the positions of Minister 
for Education and Tourism (1977-79), Minister for Water 
Resources (1983-86), and Minister for Local Development 
(1986-88).  He is a founding member of the RPP, a party 
created to bring together former Panchayat appointees, and 
served as its the General Secretary from 1990 to 2002. 
During the current period of turbulent politics, Post finds 
Rana to be one of Nepal's most reasonable advocates of 
democracy. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Rana is popular in Sindhupalchowk district, north 
of Kathmandu, from which he has been elected three times to 
Parliament.  Highly intelligent, articulate, and anglicized 
in manner, Rana is a talented public speaker.  Rana grew up 
in England and received a BA from Oxford University in 1963. 
He has been to the U.S. on a VOLVIS program.  An art 
historian by advocation, Rana has published several articles 
on the subject.  He is active in promoting Nepal as a World 
Site with UNESCO.  His wife is the daughter of Maharaja of 
Gwalior, with whom he has two daughters.
