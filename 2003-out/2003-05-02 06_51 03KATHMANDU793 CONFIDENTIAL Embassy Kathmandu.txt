SUBJECT: NEPAL CRACKS DOWN ON IRAQI TRAVELERS 
 
Classified By: DCM Robert K. Boggs for reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
¶1.  (C) In a May 1 conversation with the DCM, Foreign 
Secretary Madhu Raman Acharya disclosed that the Government 
 
SIPDIS 
of Nepal (GON) has instructed all its diplomatic posts not to 
issue visas to Iraqi passport holders without specific 
authorization from the Foreign Ministry in Kathmandu. 
According to Acharya, the GON will consider issuing visas to 
Iraqis with good reasons to be in Nepal, but will advise the 
Embassy in advance of any such issuance and provide 
biographic and travel information on those permitted entry. 
 
¶2. (U) Additionally, fifteen Iraqi refugees transiting Nepal 
on their way to Sweden were initially detained by the GON. 
All fifteen claimed to be Christians fleeing religious 
persecution in Iraq.  Some were seeking to join family 
members already in Sweden.  Eight subsequently have been 
released to the UNHCR for further processing.  Three of the 
Iraqis still in custody are in deportation proceedings, and 
the remaining four are under criminal investigation for their 
use of false documents.
