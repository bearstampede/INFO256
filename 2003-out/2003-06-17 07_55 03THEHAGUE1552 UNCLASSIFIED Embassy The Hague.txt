NOMINATING-OFFICER: Todd Kushner 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
As the Treasurer General's principal advisor on U.S. 
financial and monetary affairs, participation in this 
program would equip Willem Kooi to deliver more insightful 
and balanced judgments and policy recommendations to senior 
Finance Ministry officials on matters affecting U.S.-EU 
financial relations, bilateral financial relations, and 
development of EU internal markets. Kooi has worked on 
financial market issues -- even lectured on them at a 
university level -- but lacks direct exposure to the 
sophisticated U.S. marketplace. Intelligent, influential, 
and politically active (in the Christian Democratic party -- 
currently the largest party in the Netherlands), we expect 
Kooi to rise to increasing positions of influence and 
authority.
