(U) Classified by DCM Robert S. Deutsch.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and 
(d). 
 
 
¶1.  (S/NF) On March 28, the DCM met with Deputy DG for Middle 
Eastern Affairs Safak Gokturk to reiterate our requests 
concerning Iraqi intelligence agents/diplomats.  Reiterating 
information that Post recently had passed to the Turkish 
National Intelligence Organization (TNIO), the DCM again 
asked that the GOT close the Iraqi mission in Turkey.  He 
described this as the best way to deny Iraqi support to those 
who would engage in terrorist acts against U.S. interests in 
Turkey.  If a closure were not yet possible, he urged that 
the Turks quickly expel specific Iraqis whom he identified as 
threats to U.S. personnel. 
 
 
¶2.  (S/NF) The DCM pointed out that we had knowledge of Iraqi 
sleeper cells in 11 countries, including Turkey.  He urged 
that the GOT take action based on this highly credible threat 
information.  He highlighted our understanding, reinforced by 
recent Iraqi efforts to surveil Embassy residences, that the 
Iraqis pose an immediate threat to us.  Though he thanked the 
GOT for its security support to date, he also noted that some 
of Turkey's neighbors had already acted via targeted 
expulsions. 
 
 
¶3.  (S/NF) Though Gokturk was not more forthcoming 
immediately, he said that the MFA is "seriously working" in 
coordination with TNIO and other GOT agencies.
