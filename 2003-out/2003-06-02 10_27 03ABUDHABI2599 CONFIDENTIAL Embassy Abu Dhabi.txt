¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (C) MFA Minstate Hamdan bin Zayid, in a 5/31 
meeting with the Ambassador (other topics covered 
septel), provided a brief readout on an earlier 
meeting between former Iraqi Foreign Minister Adnan 
Pachachi and UAE President Zayid bin Sultan Al- 
Nahyan.  Pachachi and Zayid met for over an hour to 
review events in Iraq.  Pachachi was reportedly 
very positive about the U.S. role in Iraq, noting 
that he had met with U.S. and UK officials there 
and that he greatly valued these exchanges. 
Pachachi acknowledged that absent the strong and 
helpful U.S. presence, the country would be plunged 
into chaos and that a "catastrophe" would ensue. 
Hamdan noted that in the UAE's view, Pachachi had 
emerged as one of the only viable Iraqi political 
leaders, though he admitted that Pachachi's 
advanced age (he recently turned 80) would limit 
his ability to serve publicly beyond a couple of 
years.  (Comment:  We pass on this readout because 
in past public statements, Pachachi has been quite 
critical of what he has termed the U.S. 
"occupation."  It is clear that having spent some 
time on the ground in Baghdad -- after an absence 
of over thirty years -- Pachachi perhaps has come 
to appreciate the complexity of the situation.  End 
Comment.) 
 
¶3. (C) Hamdan went on to reiterate continuing 
Emirati concern, outlined by COS Muhammad bin Zayid 
during his recent Washington visit, about Iranian 
meddling in Iraq.  Hamdan said it was "very scary" 
to see what the Iranians were doing and the 
Emiratis are watching events with increasing alarm.
