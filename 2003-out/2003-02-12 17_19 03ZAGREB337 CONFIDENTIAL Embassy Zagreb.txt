SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) THE GOC IS REACTING TO IC PRESSURE ON REFUGEE RETURNS. 
 MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS AND RECONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING, 
RADIMIR CACIC, HELD A HASTILY ARRANGED MEETING ON FEBRUARY 4 
WITH THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY TO PRESENT HIS MINISTRY,S 
PROGRAM ON REFUGEE RETURN.  THE EVENT AT THE SHERATON HOTEL 
WAS HEAVILY ATTENDED BY TELEVISION AND PRINT MEDIA.  THE 
MINISTER WAS COMBATIVE.  MUCH OF WHAT CACIC SAID WAS OLD NEWS 
AND FILLED WITH QUESTIONABLE FIGURES ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT,S 
EFFORTS THUS FAR.  HE DID, HOWEVER, ANNOUNCE A NEW INITIATIVE 
AIMED AT RESTORING LOST OCCUPANCY AND TENANCY RIGHTS.  HE 
CHASTISED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR ITS LACK OF 
FINANCIAL SUPPORT WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, CRITICIZED THE GOC 
AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY FOR ITS SHORTCOMINGS ON RETURN-RELATED 
ISSUES. 
 
¶2. (C) MANY IC OFFICIALS AGREED THAT CACIC,S PRESENTATION 
WAS LONG ON STYLE BUT SHORT ON SUBSTANCE.  THE HASTY EVENT 
OBVIOUSLY WAS DESIGNED TO PUSH BACK STRONGER IC PRESSURE ON 
THE GOC ON RETURNS.  THE GOC MISSED ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO 
CONVINCE THE IC THAT IT IS WILLING TO MAKE MEANINGFUL 
PROGRESS ON RETURNS AND TO WORK WITH THE IC IN DOING SO. THAT 
SAID, THE GOC'S PUSHING BACK IS SOFTENING SOME IC RESOLVE, 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

SUMMARY. 
 
GOC LAYS OUT RED CARPET TREATMENT 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C) IN WHAT MANY IC OFFICIALS CONSIDERED AN UNUSUAL VENUE 
TO HOLD A MEETING ON REFUGEE RETURNS, GOC OFFICIALS, LED BY 
CACIC, HOSTED ALMOST ONE HUNDRED REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE 
DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY AT THE SHERATON HOTEL.  TELEVISION AND 
PRINT MEDIA PRESENCE WAS EXTENSIVE.  CACIC USED THE OCCASION 
TO REVIEW THE GOVERNMENT,S PERFORMANCE ON REFUGEE-RELATED 
ISSUES SINCE COMING TO POWER IN 2000 AND TO HIGHLIGHT NEW GOC 
PLANS TO ACCELERATE THE RETURN OF REFUGEES.  HE WANTED THIS 
EVENT TO BE UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL AND ACTED MORE LIKE A 
LECTURER THAN MINISTER.  HIS GOAL WAS TO SHOW THAT THE GOC 
REGARDED THE ISSUE OF RETURNS WITH GREAT IMPORTANCE. 
 
CACIC:  I,M IN CHARGE 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) CACIC,S DEMEANOR THROUGHOUT THE PRESENTATION WAS 
INTENDED TO DISPEL ANY NOTION THAT ANYONE ELSE BESIDE HIMSELF 
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR REFUGEE-RELATED MATTERS.  CACIC PRESENTED 
HIS DEPUTY AND ASSISTANT MINISTERS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR 
REFUGEE RETURNS, BUT DID MOST OF THE TALKING.  HE ASSUMED 
DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE GOC,S RECORD ON RETURNS OVER 
THE PAST THREE YEARS.  HE REMINDED THE AUDIENCE THAT HIS 
MINISTRY WAS HAMPERED BY LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE PREVIOUS 
GOVERNMENT.  ONLY LAST FALL WERE THE MOST CRUCIAL PARTS OF 
THIS LEGISLATION AMENDED, WHICH, HE SAID, HELPED REMOVE ALL 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00337  01 OF 04  121720Z 
OF THE LEGISLATIVE BARRIERS TO RETURN.  HE SAID HE WAS NOT 
SATISFIED WITH RESULTS TO DATE; HE QUESTIONED HIS ASSISTANT 
MINISTERS ABOUT THE LACK OF PROGRESS AND FOUND MANY OF THEIR 
RESPONSES TO BE UNACCEPTABLE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, SOME OF 
THEIR "JUSTIFICATIONS," AS HE REFERRED TO THEM, DEALT WITH 
FINANCIAL AND RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT 
WERE OUT OF THEIR CONTROL. 
EU MEMBERSHIP AT STAKE 
---------------------- 
 
¶5. (C) CACIC INSISTED THAT THE DISCONTENT IN THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY REFLECTED A LACK OF INFORMATION.  HE 
SAID HE INTENDS TO HAVE A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH THE IC TO 
SHARE INFORMATION AND AVOID FUTURE MISUNDERSTANDINGS.  THIS 
IS IMPORTANT, HE SAID, BECAUSE CROATIA WILL SOON SUBMIT ITS 
APPLICATION TO JOIN THE EU AND CROATIA IS HELPED BY GETTING 
MORE INFORMATION OUT.  HIS TOP PRIORITIES ARE RECONSTRUCTION 
AND PROPERTY RETURNS.  SINCE 2000 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE IN 
THE GOC,S ATTITUDE COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT, 
CACIC SAID: THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HELPED ONLY ETHNIC CROATS 
WHILE THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT HELPS ALL OF ITS CITIZENS.

INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS A SORE POINT FOR CACIC, AND AT 
TIMES HE CONVEYED HIS FRUSTRATION.  HE EXPRESSED GRATITUDE 
FOR THE EU-SPONSORED HOUSING PROGRAM BEING IMPLEMENTED BY THE 
GERMAN NGO ARBEITER-SAMARITER-BUND (ASB) AS HIS MINISTRY,S 
KEY PARTNER IN HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS.  UNDER THIS 
PROGRAM, ASB WILL RECONSTRUCT 1000 HOUSES.  HE NOTED THAT 
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND COUNTRIES, INCLUDING UNHCR, THE EU, 
AND U.S., ARE PROVIDING IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO RETURNING 
REFUGEES THROUGH THEIR VARIOUS PROGRAMS.  LOANS FROM 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE ENABLED THE GOC TO 
MAKE PROGRESS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS.  YET, WHILE CACIC 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT HAS HAD A DIRECT 
IMPACT, HE CLAIMED THE IC HAS SPENT ONLY ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT 
OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT SPENT ON RECONSTRUCTION SINCE 1996. 
 
¶7. (C) CACIC SAID HE EXPECTED GREATER UNHCR INVOLVEMENT 
DURING WHAT HE SAID WOULD BE A CRITICAL YEAR FOR RETURNS (REF 
A).  THIS WAS BECAUSE THREE-FOURTHS OF THE GOVERNMENT,S 
RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS WILL BENEFIT RETURNING SERBS.  HE SAID 
HE REGRETTED THAT IT TOOK SO LONG FOR THE PROGRAMS TO HAVE A 
DIRECT IMPACT ON THE SERB POPULATION.  THE GOC PLANS TO ISSUE 
7,500 DECISIONS FOR RECONSTRUCTION THIS YEAR, WHICH WILL MAKE 
IT POSSIBLE FOR AT LEAST 20,000 PEOPLE TO RETURN IF THEY 
CHOOSE TO DO SO ONCE THEIR HOUSES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED.  HE 
CLAIMED THAT SINCE SEPTEMBER 2002, ALMOST 940 PROPERTIES HAVE 
BEEN REPOSSESSED.  THE GOC PLANS TO RETURN ALL HOMES TO THEIR 
RIGHTFUL OWNERS BY THE END OF 2003. 
 
NEW INITIATIVE TO RESTORE TENANCY RIGHTS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00337  02 OF 04  121721Z 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (C) CACIC,S DECLARATION THAT THE GOC WOULD SEEK TO 
RESTORE LOST OCCUPANCY AND TENANCY RIGHTS SPARKED THE 
GREATEST ATTENTION FROM HIS AUDIENCE.  HE SAID THAT IN THE 
AREAS OF SPECIAL STATE CONCERN ("ASSC" -- WAR-AFFECTED AREAS) 
ALL CITIZENS WERE VICTIMS OF THE WAR AND HAVE A RIGHT TO 
RETURN, TO QUALIFY FOR HOUSING CARE AND TO PURCHASE THEIR 
FORMER RIGHTS.  FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVED OUTSIDE THE ASSC (THAT 
IS MOST FORMER OTR HOLDERS), THEY WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE 
GOC,S PROGRAM ON PUBLICLY FUNDED HOUSING CONSTRUCTION.  A 
NEW LAW WILL BE ENACTED THAT WILL CALL FOR THE FORMULATION OF 
LISTS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF WHO CAN QUALIFY FOR SUCH 
ASSISTANCE. 
 
¶9. (C) UNDER THE PROGRAM, THE MINISTER EXPLAINED, THERE WOULD 
BE TWO POSSIBILITIES: OWNERSHIP AND RENT.  UNDER THE 
OWNERSHIP PROGRAM, LOANS WILL BE OFFERED WHICH THE OWNERS 
WILL HAVE TO REPAY OVER A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD.  THE RENT 
PROGRAM WILL INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT WILL ALLOW THE PERSON TO 
PAY RENT FOR A REQUIRED PERIOD OF TIME, AFTER WHICH HE WILL 
BECOME THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY.  CACIC ENVISIONED A 4-YEAR 
PERIOD TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM.  FORMER TENANCY RIGHT 
HOLDERS WILL BE GIVEN A ONE-YEAR DEADLINE TO APPLY AND 2 TO 3 
YEARS FOR THE PROPERTIES TO BE BUILT.  THE GOC WILL EARMARK 
FUNDS FOR THE PROGRAM BY THE END OF THE YEAR, AND CACIC SAID 
IT EXPECTS THE PROGRAM WILL BE COMPLETED BY 2006. 
 
¶10. (C) CACIC PREDICTED THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE A HIGH NUMBER 
OF APPLICATIONS FROM SERBS CURRENTLY LIVING IN 
SERBIA-MONTENEGRO AND BIH.  THESE ARE THE POPULATIONS THE IC 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00337  02 OF 04  121721Z 
WANTED TO RETURN TO CROATIA.  MANY OF THE SERBS THAT WOULD 
QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM DO NOT WANT TO RETURN TO CROATIA BUT 
WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELL ANY PROPERTY PROVIDED TO THEM, 
AN OUTCOME STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE GOC.   THE PROGRAM AS 
OUTLINED BY CACIC IS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE WHO 
REALLY WANT TO RETURN.  HE STATED THAT THE GOC DID NOT 
CURRENTLY HAVE THE MONEY TO INITIATE THE PROGRAM BUT WOULD 
RESOLVE THE FUNDING ISSUE SOON.  IT HAD TO IN ORDER TO 
RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF OCCUPANCY AND TENANCY RIGHTS ONCE AND 
FOR ALL.  HE STRESSED THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SELL 
THE PROPERTIES OBTAINED THROUGH THE PROGRAM. 
 
CONTENTIOUS QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  (C) A BRIEF QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD FOLLOWED CACIC,S 
REMARKS.  THE MINISTER BECAME IRRITATED AND CONFRONTATIONAL 
WHEN OSCE HEAD PETER SEMNEBY ASKED FOR SPECIFIC INFORMATION 
ABOUT THE TENANCY RIGHTS INITIATIVE, NOTABLY WHEN WOULD THE 
ONE-YEAR DEADLINE BEGIN FOR FORMER TENANCY RIGHTS HOLDERS. 
CACIC RESPONDED THAT HE WOULD WAIT FOR THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY TO TELL HIM WHAT TO DO.  THIS WAY, THE IC COULD NOT 
SAY THAT THE GOC SET A SHORT DEADLINE THAT WAS DISCRIMINATORY 
AGAINST SERBS WHO DID NOT RESIDE IN CROATIA.  CACIC SAID HE 
WOULD SIGN ANY PROPOSAL THE IC SUBMITTED TO HIM, BUT THEN HE 
DID NOT WANT TO HEAR COMPLAINTS AFTERWARDS.

¶12.  (C) OTHER LEADING IC REPS RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT RENTAL 
COMPENSATION FOR CURRENT OWNERS WHO ARE NOT OCCUPYING THEIR 
PROPERTIES AND FOR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM THE LOOTING OF 
PROPERTIES BY TEMPORARY OCCUPANTS AS THEY VACATE THEM.  CACIC 
REPLIED THAT THE GOC WILL PROVIDE RENTAL COMPENSATION TO 
THOSE WHO QUALIFY UNDER THE LAW BUT HE DID NOT SAY WHEN IT 
WOULD BEGIN.  AS FOR LOOTING, CACIC SAID THE GOC DID NOT HAVE 
THE MONEY TO COMPENSATE EVERYONE WHOSE PROPERTY HAD BEEN 
LOOTED.  HE EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT CROATIA WAS BEING ASKED 
TO PROVIDE SUCH COMPENSATION WHEN NO OTHER COUNTRY IN THE 
REGION WAS ASKED TO DO SO. 
 
INCREASING THE STAKES 
--------------------- 
 
¶13. (C) IC PRESSURE ON THE GOC TO STEP UP TO THE RETURNS 
ISSUE HAS INCREASED RECENTLY IN WAYS IT APPARENTLY CANNOT 
IGNORE.  WE NEED TO JUDGE THE GOC BY ITS ACTIONS AND BY 
RESULTS ON THE GROUND, NOT BY RHETORIC OR DECLARATIONS.  SO 
FAR, WHAT IS CLEAR -- CACIC'S PERSONAL LEAD MADE THIS CLEAR 
-- IS THAT MORE CAREFULLY "MANAGING" THE RETURNS ISSUE WITH 
THE IC IS PART OF THE GOC'S EFFORT TO MAINTAIN MOMENTUM 
TOWARD THE EU AND NATO.  IT WAS LESS OBVIOUS THAT ACTUALLY 
SOLVING THIS BIG PROBLEM IS ON THE GOC'S AGENDA -- MOST OF 
WHAT CACIC TALKED ABOUT WAS EITHER OLD HAT TO THOSE WHO WORK 
THESE ISSUES OR INSUFFICIENTLY DETAILED TO BE GROUNDS FOR 
CONFIDENCE THAT THE GOC IS TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF. 
 
¶14. (C) THIS EVENT WAS ONLY THE LATEST SIGN THAT THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        ZAGREB  00337  03 OF 04  121721Z 
INCREASED IC PRESSURE IS REACHING AND RESONATING AT THE 
HIGHEST GOC LEVELS, AND THAT THE GOC KNOWS THE STAKES HAVE 
INCREASED.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PLAN TO ADDRESS THE 
OCCUPANCY AND TENANCY RIGHTS PROBLEM IS PROOF OF THAT; THE 
ISSUE HAS LANGUISHED SINCE THE IC RAISED IT, TO LITTLE 
EFFECT, WITH PM RACAN IN DECEMBER 2001.  ON ITS FACE, CACIC'S 
PLAN WOULD REPRESENT A REAL STEP FORWARD, BUT THE SHORTFALL 
HERE ALWAYS IS IMPLEMENTATION AND WE WILL BE WATCHING 
CAREFULLY.  CACIC'S PRESENTATION LEFT US NO MORE CONVINCED 
THAN BEFORE THAT THE GOC HAS ANY REAL DESIRE, WILL OR INTENT 
TO ACT ON RETURNS ISSUES ESPECIALLY IN THIS ELECTION YEAR. 
 
...BUT OSCE/EU WAVERING 
------------------------ 
 
¶15. (C) THAT SAID, GOC PUSH BACK FOLLOWING THE IC PRINCIPALS 
JANUARY 23 LETTER TO PM RACAN SUSPENDING PARTICIPATING IN THE 
JOINT LEGAL WORKING GROUP IS HAVING AN IMPACT.  OSCE HOM 
SEMNEBY WAS QUICK, AND AT PAINS, TO PUT OUT A BEST-CASE 
LAUDATORY PRESS RELEASE ON CACIC'S ANNOUNCED OCCUPANCY AND 
TENANCY RIGHTS PLAN.  SEMNEBY ALSO PULLED EVERY CONCEIVABLE 
PUNCH IN AN EXCESSIVELY POSITIVE BRIEFING ON THESE ISSUES TO 
THE EU WESTERN BALKANS WORKING GROUP (COWEB) IN BRUSSELS 
FEBRUARY 6.  YET AGAIN IN AN IC PANEL BRIEFING FOR A VISITING 
OSCE PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION FEBRUARY 10, SEMNEBY TOOK A 
NOTABLY SOFTER LINE ON THE GOC THAN DID UNHCR, THE UN LIAISON 
OFFICE OR OUR OWN EMBASSY PARTICIPANT.  IT IS CLEAR TO US AND 
TO SEMNEBY'S AMERICAN DEPUTY HOM (PROTECT) THAT SEMNEBY IS 
GETTING COLD FEET OUT OF FEAR THAT THE OSCE-GOC RELATIONSHIP 
WILL SOUR AND HE WILL END UP COLD-SHOULDERED AND VILIFIED 
LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR BERNARD PONCET.  THAT COULD HAPPEN, BUT 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        ZAGREB  00337  03 OF 04  121721Z 
IF SO IT WOULD BE OF LIMITED IMPORT FOR REAL IC INTERESTS 
HERE.  THE OSCE MISSION IS LIKE UNMOVIC -- IF THE HOST 
COUNTRY REJECTS AND OBSTRUCTS PEOPLE WHO CAN ONLY HELP IT 
RESOLVE ISSUES OF INTERNATIONAL CONCERN, BUT NOT ENFORCE, ITS 
VALUE DISAPPEARS AND IT COULD AS EASILY GO AWAY.  WE ARE 
CONVEYING TO THE OSCE MISSION AND TO SEMNEBY THAT WHILE WE 
WANT THEM TO TRY TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE GOC, 
THEY WILL NOT HAVE OUR SUPPORT IF THEY LOSE FOCUS AND 
SACRIFICE BASIC PRINCIPLES IN THE PROCESS. 
 
¶16. (C) OF PERHAPS MORE CONCERN ARE INDICATIONS THAT EUROPEAN 
COMMISSION PRESSURE ALSO PEAKED LAST MONTH WITH THEIR ACTIVE 
SUPPORT FOR SUSPENDING THE JOINT LEGAL WORKING GROUP. THE 
COMMISSION DEPUTY HEAD JOINED SEMNEBY IN SOFT-PEDALING 
CRITICISM OF THE GOC AT THE OSCE PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION 
BRIEFING.  THE COMMISSION AND OSCE MISSIONS INCREASINGLY LINK 
THEIR WORK AND OPERATE IN TANDEM; FOR EXAMPLE, SEMNEBY AND 
THE COMMISSION DEPUTY MET TOGETHER WITH CACIC THE WEEK BEFORE 
HIS PUBLIC BRIEFING, AND THE TWO INVARIABLY LINK THEIR 
MANDATES AND POLICY AGENDAS IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC STATEMENTS 
HERE IN ZAGREB.  TALKING TO MOST EU AMBASSADORS HERE, WE FIND 
A BROAD MAJORITY CRITICAL OF GOC PERFORMANCE BUT NOT EAGER TO 
DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD OBSTRUCT HANDLING OF CROATIA'S 
IMMINENT EU APPLICATION IN ANY WAY OTHER THAN THE NORMAL 
MANNER.  THE GERMANS AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THE AUSTRIANS ARE 
APOLOGISTS FOR THE GOC; THE BRITISH AND DUTCH ANCHOR THE

EASIER ON THE GOC. 
 
NEXT STEPS 
---------- 
 
¶17. (C) WE KNOW THERE IS AN INTENSE DEBATE WITHIN THE GOC ON 
HOW TO HANDLE THE INCREASED IC PRESSURE.  PM RACAN IS SAID TO 
FAVOR SOME RESPONSIVENESS, BUT DPM GRANIC, THE MFA, CACIC'S 
ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR RETURNS AND A KEY RACAN AIDE ARE ALL 
REPORTED TO BE ARGUING FOR THE GOC TO SHUT OUT MEANINGFUL IC 
DIALOGUE AND GO ITS OWN WAY.  THE RACAN AIDE MADE IT CLEAR 
BOTH TO SEMNEBY AND THE AMBASSADOR THAT RACAN WILL NOT ENGAGE 
ON IC CONCERNS ANYTIME SOON, IF EVER.  RACAN IS NO LEADER; 
THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS ANTI-COOPERATION 
CONSTELLATION WILL PREVAIL ABSENT CONSTANT AND STRONG IC 
PRESSURE.  WE WILL WORK TO REINFORCE THE PRESSURE HERE.  WE 
URGE THAT THE USG PRESS THIS ISSUE IN BRUSSELS AND IN EU AND 
NATO CAPITALS WHENEVER CROATIA IS ON THE AGENDA.  UNLESS WE 
PRESS THE GOC HARD AND CONSTANTLY, WE WILL NOT GET THE 
FORCEFUL GOC ACTION NEEDED TO GET SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF 
RETURNEES HOME, EVER.
