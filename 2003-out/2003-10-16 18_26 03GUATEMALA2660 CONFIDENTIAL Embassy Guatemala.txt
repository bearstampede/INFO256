Classified By: DCM Bruce Wharton for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) DCM and PolCouns met with Deputy Foreign Minister 
Gabriel Aguilera and MFA Director of Multilateral Affairs 
Carla Rodriguez on October 15 to urge the GOG to attend the 
Madrid Donors Conference and to pledge financial support for 
the reconstruction of Iraq.  DCM noted that the whole 
international community shares an interest in the prompt 
reconstruction of Iraq, and that Guatemala's participation in 
the Madrid conference and a financial contribution by the GOG 
to the reconstruction effort would gain for Guatemala 
recognition among the international community. 
 
¶2. (C) Aguilera acknowledged that the GOG had received an 
invitation from the Government of Spain to participate in the 
conference, but said that no determination had been taken yet 
by the GOG on its possible participation or on a financial 
contribution to Iraq's reconstruction.  He commented that the 
MFA is seeking input from other ministries, and would inform 
us once a decision had been made.
