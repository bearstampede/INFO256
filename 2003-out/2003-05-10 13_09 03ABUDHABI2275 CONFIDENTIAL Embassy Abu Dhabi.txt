¶1.  (U) Classified by Charge D'Affaires Richard Albright 
for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (C) The UAEG confirmed in a May 6 conference call of 
the informal contact group on Iraq reconstruction that the 
UAE Central Bank is now managing the day-to-day operations 
of the single branch of Rafidain Bank in the UAE.  Director 
of Banking Supervision Saeed Al-Hamiz recently told 
Econchief that the branch has been reduced to its statutory 
capital as required by UAE banking laws, and conducts 3-4 
transactions each day. 
 
¶3.  (C) In response to ref A, Central Bank officials say 
that the UAEG will transfer the assets of the UAE branch of 
Rafidain Bank to its Head Office in Baghdad as soon as the 
UN sanctions on Iraq are lifted, and Rafidain Bank is 
legally reconstituted in Iraq.  UAE representatives noted 
to the informal contact group that they expect Rafidain 
Bank to play an important role in the reconstruction of 
Iraq. 
 
¶4.  (C) Open source banking documents reveal that Rafidain 
Bank in the UAE has operated on a limited basis since the 
1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  According to official UAE 
statistics, the bank currently maintains total assets of 
USD $18.8 million, USD $17.3 million of which are frozen in 
the United States and Germany.
