SUBJECT: DISCOVERY OF IED NEAR U.S. EMBASSY - RANGOON 
 
REF: RSO CLASSIFIED E-MAIL TO DSERCC AND SES-O_DSOPCC 
     DATED 27 MARCH 
 
 ¶1.  (U) AT APPROXIMATELY 06:20 THIS MORNING, AN IMPROVISED 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE (IED) WAS DISCOVERED IN MAHABANDOOLA PARK 
WHICH FRONTS MERCHANT STREET ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE 
CHANCERY.  THE DEVICE WAS DISCOVERED DURING A ROUTINE CHECK 
BY HOST COUNTRY SECURITY SERVICES AND WAS DESCRIBED AS A 
1/2-POUND BLOCK OF TNT WITH TWO AA-BATTERIES, A FUSE 
DETONATOR, TIMER, AND A BLASTING CAP.  THE IED WAS DISCOVERED 
INSIDE A PLASTIC SHOPPING BAG THAT WAS PLACED ON OPEN GROUND 
(NO CONCEALMENT), INSIDE THE PARK, APPROXIMATELY 200 METERS 
W-NW OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE CHANCERY.  THE IED WAS 
APPROXIMATELY 5-METERS INSIDE THE PARK FENCE LINE THAT 
PARALLELS SULE PAGODA ROAD.  HOST COUNTRY EOD SERVICES MOVED 
THE IED FROM THE PARK TO A SAFE AREA TO DISARM THE DEVICE, 
AND, INADVERTENTLY, DETONATED THE BLASTING CAP, SLIGHTLY 
INJURING TWO OF THE EOD PERSONNEL.  THE TIMER ON THE DEVICE 
WAS SET FOR 0830.  AS FAR AS WE KNOW, NO OTHER ITEMS, I.E. 
PAMPHLETS OR LITERATURE, WERE FOUND WITH THE DEVICE. 
 
¶2.  (U) POST BELIEVES THIS DEVICE WAS INTENDED TO CAUSE 
DISRUPTION TO THE "NATIONAL ARMED FORCES DAY" CELEBRATION 
WHICH IS SCHEDULED TODAY (27 MARCH).  WE HAVE NO REASON TO 
BELIEVE THAT IT WAS TARGETED AGAINST THE U.S. EMBASSY.  THE 
LOCATION OF THE IED IS FAR REMOVED FROM BOTH THE PARADE ROUTE 
AND CELEBRATION SITES, WHICH ARE CHECKED SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. 
 EVEN IF DETONATED, THE DEVICE WOULD ONLY CAUSE MINIMAL 
DAMAGE, UNLESS, OF COURSE, A VISITOR HAPPENED TO BE IN CLOSE 
PROXIMITY TO THE DEVICE WHEN DETONATION OCCURRED. 
 
¶3.  (U) MAHABANDOOLA PARK IS CURRENTLY CLOSED.  SECURITY 
SERVICES CONDUCTED A COMPLETE SWEEP OF THE PARK AND DID NOT 
LOCATE ANY OTHER DEVICES.  LOCAL GUARDS HAVE CHECKED THE 
ENTIRE PERIMETER AROUND THE CHANCERY--WITHIN THE PROTECTIVE 
ZONE--AND DID NOT LOCATE ANY DEVICES.  RSO ORDERED MSG POST 
ONE TO INITIATE AN EMERGENCY CELL CALL TO ALL AMERICAN STAFF 
ALERTING THEM TO AVOID THE EMBASSY AND PARK AREA UNTIL 
FURTHER NOTICE.  ALL EAC MEMBERS, INCLUDING THE CHARGE AND 
DCM, HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE SITUATION.  RSO CONTACTED 
DSOPCC AT 09:15 TO REPORT THE INCIDENT.  THE CONSULAR SECTION 
HAS BEEN NOTIFIED AND A WARDEN MESSAGE WILL BE SENT TO THE 
AMERICAN COMMUNITY LATER THIS DATE. 
 
¶4.  (U) BARRING FURTHER INCIDENTS, POST IS PLANNING TO OPEN 
FOR NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ON FRIDAY, 28 MARCH.  THE EAP 
IS SCHEDULED TO CONVENE AT 09:00 ON FRIDAY TO DISCUSS THE 
INCIDENT AND ASSESS POST SECURITY POSTURE.
