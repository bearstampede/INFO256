SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ: IRAQ SENDS LETTER PRE-EMPTIVELY TAKING 
ISSUE WITH THE SECRETARY'S FEBRUARY 5 PRESENTATION 
 
¶1. (U) IRAQI FM NAJI SABRI SUBMITTED THE FOLLOWING LETTER TO 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL (S/2003/132), CONCERNING THE U.S. 
PRESENTATION TO THE COUNCIL ON FEBRUARY 5.  THE FULL TEXT OF 
THE LETTER FOLLOWS IN PARA 2. 
 
¶2. (U) BEGIN TEXT. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS 
CALLED FOR A MEETING OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON 5 FEBRUARY 
2003 AT WHICH UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL 
WILL PRESENT WHAT HAS BEEN DUBBED "EVIDENCE OF IRAQ'S 
POSSESSION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION." 
 
THIS PLAY-ACTING HAS BECOME TRANSPARENT AFTER THE SUBMISSION 
BY THE UNITED STATES OF MORE THAN ONE REPORT FILLED WITH 
ALLEGATIONS AND ACCUSATIONS DEVOID OF ANY EVIDENCE TO 
SUBSTANTIATE THEM, SUCH AS THE REPORT ANNEXED TO THE SPEECH 
OF UNITED STATES PRESIDENT BUSH BEFORE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
ON 12 SEPTEMBER 2002, ENTITLED "A DECADE OF DECEPTION AND 
DEFIANCE," AND THE REPORT OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
(CIA) OF OCTOBER 2002, ENTITLED "IRAQ'S WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION PROGRAMS." IN BOTH THOSE REPORTS, THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION ACCUSED IRAQ OF DEVELOPING WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION AT MORE THAN 50 SITES. BRITISH PRIME MINISTER 
TONY BLAIR HAS PLAYED A SUPPORTING ROLE IN THIS REGARD, 
PUBLISHING A SIMILAR REPORT IN OCTOBER 2002 IN WHICH HE 
CLAIMED THAT THERE EXISTED SPECIFIC SITES IN IRAQ AT WHICH 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WERE BEING DEVELOPED. 
 
AFTER IRAQ ACCEPTED THE RETURN OF THE INSPECTORS ON 16 
SEPTEMBER 2002 AND AGREED TO DEAL WITH SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTION 1441 (2002), THE UNITED NATIONS MONITORING, 
VERIFICATION AND INSPECTION COMMISSION (UNMOVIC) AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY (IAEA) WERE REQUESTED TO 
ACCORD PRIORITY, IN RESUMING INSPECTIONS, TO SITES ALLEGED BY 
THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN TO BE DEVELOPING WEAPONS OF 
MASS DESTRUCTION PROGRAMMES. 
 
INSPECTION WORK BEGAN ON 27 NOVEMBER 2002. AFTER TWO MONTHS 
OF INTENSIVE INSPECTIONS INVOLVING THE USE OF 
STATE-OF-THE-ART EQUIPMENT FOR DETECTING ANY PROSCRIBED 
NUCLEAR, CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY AND THE ANALYSIS OF 
WATER, SOIL AND AIR SAMPLES ALL OVER IRAQ DURING 518 TOURS OF 
INSPECTION COMPRISING ALL THE SITES THAT WERE THE OBJECT OF 
PRESIDENT BUSH'S AND PRIME MINISTER BLAIR'S ACCUSATIONS, AS 
WELL AS NUMEROUS OTHER SITES, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL QUARTERS 
IN IRAQI CITIES, THE REPORT OF MESSRS. BLIX AND ELBARADEI, 
SUBMITTED TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON 27 JANUARY 2003, 
SUBSTANTIATED IRAQ'S DECLARATIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY CONFIRMED 
THAT THE REPORTS OF PRESIDENT BUSH AND PRIME MINISTER BLAIR 
WERE DEVOID OF TRUTH AND HAD BEEN DRAFTED IN ORDER TO DISTORT 
THE PICTURE OF IRAQ AND CREATE PRETEXTS FOR AGGRESSION 
AGAINST IRAQ AND AGAINST THE REGION AS A WHOLE. 
 
PERHAPS THIS FACT EXPLAINS THE URGENT REQUESTS ADDRESSED TO 
STATES BY MESSRS. BLIX AND ELBARADEI TO PROVIDE UNMOVIC AND 
IAEA WITH VERIFIABLE EVIDENCE OF ANY PROSCRIBED ACTIVITIES, 
SUBSTANCES OR MATERIALS IN IRAQ AND THE INSISTENCE OF STATES 
MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL THAT THOSE STATES WHICH ARE 
ALLEGING THAT IRAQ IS DEVELOPING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 
SUBMIT THEIR EVIDENCE TO UNMOVIC AND IAEA PURSUANT TO 
PARAGRAPH 10 OF RESOLUTION 1441 (2002), WHICH READS, 
"REQUESTS ALL MEMBER STATES TO GIVE FULL SUPPORT TO UNMOVIC 
AND THE IAEA IN THE DISCHARGE OF THEIR MANDATES, INCLUDING BY 
PROVIDING ANY INFORMATION RELATED TO PROHIBITED PROGRAMMES OR 
OTHER ASPECTS OF THEIR MANDATES ..." 
 
ON THE BASIS OF THE ABOVE TEXT, CONTAINED IN THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL RESOLUTION, WE REQUEST THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, THROUGH YOU, TO SUBMIT IMMEDIATELY ITS ALLEGED 
EVIDENCE TO THE TECHNICAL COMMITTEE ENTRUSTED BY THE UNITED 
NATIONS WITH VERIFYING SUCH ALLEGATIONS, NAMELY UNMOVIC (IF 
THEY RELATE TO PROSCRIBED ACTIVITIES IN THE CHEMICAL, 
BIOLOGICAL OR MISSILE FIELDS) OR IAEA (IF THEY RELATE TO 
PROSCRIBED ACTIVITIES IN THE NUCLEAR FIELD), SO AS TO ENABLE 
THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS TO BEGIN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS 
IMMEDIATELY AND INFORM THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THOSE 
ALLEGATIONS ARE CORRECT. 
 
IN THIS CONNECTION, WE CAUTION AGAINST USING THE GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY OR THE SECURITY COUNCIL AS FORUMS FOR SPREADING 
FALSE ACCUSATIONS AND FABRICATED EVIDENCE IN OPEN DISREGARD 
FOR THE MECHANISMS PRESCRIBED BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL
