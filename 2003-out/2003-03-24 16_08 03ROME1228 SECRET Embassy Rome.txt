SUBJECT: S63-03 IRANIAN ENTITIES SEEKING TO PROCURE CBW 
MATERIAL FROM AG COUNTRIES 
 
REF: SECSTATE 71539 

CLASSIFIED BY: ECONOMIC COUNSELOR KAREN MILLIKEN. REASON: 1.5 (C AND D) 
 
¶1. (S) ECONOFF DELIVERED REFTEL POINTS TO MFA EXPORT CONTROL 
COORDINATOR UGO DE MOHR ON MARCH 21.  DE MOHR (WHO HAS 
REASSUMED HIS POSITION FOLLOWING AN EXTENDED ABSENCE) 
WELCOMED THE RECEIPT OF FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE U.S., 
FOLLOWING UP TO RECENT DISCUSSIONS AMONG AUSTRALIA GROUP 
MEMBERS OF IRANIAN EFFORTS TO PROCURE CBW MATERIAL FROM AG 
COUNTRIES. DE MOHR NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT OUR INFORMATION WOULD 
BE EVEN MORE USEFUL IF THERE WAS SOME INDICATION OF WHEN SUCH 
PROCUREMENT ATTEMPTS OCCURRED AND AT WHAT FREQUENCY, AS A 
MEANS OF DETECTING PATTERNS THAT MIGHT ASSIST OTHER AG 
MEMBERS IN HALTING SUCH EFFORTS.  HE FURTHER COMMENTED THAT 
THE GOI HAD IN THE PAST PROHIBITED EXPORTS TO THE IRANIAN 
PASTEUR INSTITUTE (IPI) AFTER THE IRANIANS HAD REJECTED THE 
DETAILED LEVEL OF INSPECTIONS ON WHICH THE GOI CONDITIONED 
SUCH EXPORTS (THOUGH HE SAID ITALY NEVER SAW FIRM EVIDENCE 
THAT THE IPI WAS INVOLVED IN ANY ACTIVITY OF CONCERN). 
 
¶2. (C) FOLLOWING UP ON THE AUSTRALIA GROUP MEETING IN 
JANUARY, DE MOHR FAVORABLY NOTED THE U.S. INITIATIVE TO DRAFT 
AND CIRCULATE A PAPER ON STREAMLINING THE PROCESS OF 
INTRODUCING NEW ITEMS TO THE CONTROLLED LIST.  DE MOHR IS 
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE DRAFT.  MORE GENERALLY, HE 
NOTED THAT THE CIRCULATION OF PAPERS FOR AG MEETINGS WAS 
INCREASINGLY OCCURRING VERY CLOSE TO MEETING DATES, MAKING IT 
DIFFICULT FOR AG MEMBER GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING THE GOI, TO 
CARRY OUT ESSENTIAL INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS TO ALLOW A 
SUBSTANTIVE REACTION DURING THE MEETING. HE SUGGESTED 
CIRCULATION OF PAPERS AT LEAST TWO MONTHS BEFORE A MEETING 
    WOULD BE IDEAL. 
 
¶3. (SBU) BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE: WE WERE SURPRISED TO LEARN OF DE 
MOHR'S RETURN TO HIS OLD JOB, APPROXIMATELY ONE MONTH AFTER 
HIS ASSISTANT TOLD US HE HAD QUIT THE POSITION AFTER BEING 
PASSED OVER FOR AN AMBASSADORIAL ASSIGNMENT.  ACCORDING TO 
HIS ASSISTANT, DE MOHR IS APPROACHING THE MFA'S MANDATORY 
RETIREMENT AGE, AND NEEDS TO RECEIVE SUCH AN APPOINTMENT SOON 
IN ORDER TO SPEND A FULL TOUR OVERSEAS.  HE APPARENTLY HOPES 
THAT AN APPOINTMENT WILL BE FORTHCOMING NEAR THE END OF THIS 
YEAR.
