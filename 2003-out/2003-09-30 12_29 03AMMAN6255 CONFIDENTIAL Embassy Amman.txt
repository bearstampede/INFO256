SUBJECT: PSI BACKGROUND AND TALKING POINTS DELIVERED TO 
JORDAN 
 
REF: A. STATE 272470 
     ¶B. STATE 254587 
 
Classified By: DCM David M. Hale for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  PolCouns and PolOff September 29 delivered ref a 
points on the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) to Ali 
al-Ayed, Foreign Minister Muasher's Private Office Director. 
PolCouns had previously delivered ref b text of the Statement 
of Interdiction Principles (SOP) to Ayed on September 7. 
PolCouns asked for the GOJ's ideas on how to broaden 
participation in the PSI and make it more effective.  Ayed 
said that the MFA has sent the SOP for a "technical and legal 
assessment" which had not been completed.  He mentioned that 
the UK and Dutch Embassies had approached the MFA separately 
in support of PSI.  The British and Dutch DCMs confirmed to 
us separately that, on instructions from capitals, they had 
approached the GOJ and had received similar responses. 
 
¶2.  (C)  COMMENT:  Since most of the key MFA personnel who 
would have to study and evaluate the PSI and SOP are 
currently in New York as part of the GOJ's UNGA delegation, 
we do not expect a considered Jordanian opinion before the 
October 9-10 PSI meeting in London.
