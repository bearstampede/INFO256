¶1.  (C)  Following the return of King Abdullah from a 5 day 
trip to the UAE and Qatar late on March 18, the Ambassador on 
the morning of March 19 hand delivered to the King ref a 
letter from President Bush regarding Jordan's support in 
fighting terrorism. 
 
¶2.  (S/NF)  In a subsequent meeting with the Ambassador later 
on March 19, the King focused his response on the common 
threats -- particularly from terrorist groups -- that both 
the U.S. and Jordan face as the region moves toward war in 
Iraq.  He stated that Jordan had increased its surveillance 
of Iraqi intelligence agents in Jordan (see ref b), and would 
take all necessary steps to protect both U.S. and Jordanian 
interests.
