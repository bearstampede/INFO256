-MARKET PROSPECTS FOR RE-MANUFACTURED, RE-BUILT, 
AND/OR USED MOTOR VEHICLE PARTS ARE PROMISING.  THERE IS 
POTENTIAL FOR ESTABLISHING A RE-MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN 
JORDAN, ALTHOUGH THE MARKET FOR RE-MANUFACTURED PARTS FOR 
U.S. MAKES/MODELS IS LIMITED, OWING TO THE SMALL NUMBER 
OF U.S.-MADE VEHICLES IN THE KINGDOM. 
 
-  THE JORDAN INSTITUTE FOR STANDARDS AND METROLOGY 
(JISM) IS CONSIDERING A PRE-IMPORT CERTIFICATION PROGRAM 
FOR, INTER ALIA, NEW AND USED AUTO PARTS.  SUCH A 
PROGRAM, IF IMPLEMENTED, COULD IMPACT THE MARKET 
PROSPECTS FOR REBUILT AND/OR USED AUTO PARTS.
