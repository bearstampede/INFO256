SUBJECT: JORDAN SUPPORTS IRAQI GOVERNING COUNCIL, TRYING TO 
GAUGE OTHER ARAB SUPPORT 
 
REF: A. STATE 215824

Classified By: PolCouns Doug Silliman for reasons 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  PolCouns on July 28 raised ref a points on 
supporting the Iraqi Governing Council (GC) with Samer 
Dabbas, Iraq action officer in FonMin Muasher's Private 
Office.  Dabbas listened carefully to the points, noting 
especially the comments of UNSYG Annan in support of the GC. 
He noted that Jordan very strongly supports USG goals in 
Iraq, and that Jordanian FonMin Muasher made one of the first 
public statements in support of the GC (ref b). 
 
¶2.  (C)  Samer said that the MFA has been unable to gauge the 
support of other Arab states for the GC and their willingness 
to make supportive statements.  He said that Muasher would 
raise this issue during the upcoming Arab League follow-up 
committee meeting in Cairo on August 5, and that he would 
"try to pin down Egypt."  He said that "(Syrian President) 
Bashar (al-Asad) and (AL SecGen Amr) Moussa" have been the 
blocks to AL endorsement of the GC.  He suggested that 
Bahrain, as the current chair of the Arab League, could also 
be helpful in getting a positive statement from the Arab 
League on the GC.
