(C)  With Kuwaiti MinState for Foreign Affairs Dr. Mohamad 
al-Sabah in Riyadh for the GCC Ministerial, Charge called MFA 
Undersecretary Khaled Al-Jarallah February 5 to remind him 
that the Secretary would be making a major presentation on 
Iraq at the UN later that day. Drawing from points in reftel, 
Charge urged the Kuwaitis to have a statement in support of 
the US position ready for release soon after the Secretary 
ended his speech.  Jarallah thanked the US for the 
suggestion, and said he was sure the Kuwaitis would in fact 
take the advice.  Since he would have to clear this text with 
Dr. Mohamad in Riyadh in any case, Jarallah said he would 
also suggest that the GCC make a statement of support as 
well.  Jarallah added that regardless of the decision in 
Riyadh, the US could count on a statement from Kuwait.
