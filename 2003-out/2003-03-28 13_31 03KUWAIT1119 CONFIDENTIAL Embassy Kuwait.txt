¶1. (C) Embassy notes that that KOC reported production from 
its northern fields has risen 7.1% from 400,265 barrels on 
March 26 to 428,689 barrels on March 28.  This increase is 
expected to continue as KOC officials open more shut-in well 
heads in the Ratqa and, eventually, the Abdali fields. 
However, it is unclear whether and to what extent production 
in other areas of Kuwait may be reduced as northern output 
rises.
