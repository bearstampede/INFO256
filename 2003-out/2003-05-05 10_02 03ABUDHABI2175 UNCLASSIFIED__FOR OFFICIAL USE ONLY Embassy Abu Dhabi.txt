SUBJECT:  UAE EXTENDS AMNESTY 
 
REF: A) ABU DHABI 1634 
 
     B) ABU DHABI 1946 
 
¶1. (U) The UAEG announced that it has extended the 
amnesty period for illegal aliens to depart the 
country without penalty an additional month. (See ref 
A).  The four month amnesty period was scheduled to 
end on April 30, but officials have given illegal 
aliens until May 31 to leave the UAE. The official 
Ministry of Interior announcement declared, "Due to a 
large increase in illegal entrants applying at 
immigration offices to leave the UAE and because of 
humanitarian reasons, the cabinet decided to extend 
the amnesty by one month until the end of May."  Local 
press emphasized the humanitarian angle of the 
decision, extensively quoting laudatory statements 
from diplomats whose nationals are the primary targets 
of the amnesty -- Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri 
Lankans and Indians. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  Not withstanding any official 
statements about the humanitarian nature of the 
extension, the amnesty has failed to live up to 
expectations and the UAEG had little recourse but to 
extend it in the hopes that more illegals would leave 
the country.  (See ref B). During the original four 
month period, only 66,595 illegals applied for amnesty 
-- far less than the expected 200,000-250,000. A one- 
month extension will have no significant impact on the 
overall numbers unless and until the UAE demonstrates 
-- as it has yet to do -- that it is serious about 
cracking down on illegals.  For many illegal 
expatriates here, the penalty for being caught outside 
the amnesty program is little different from the terms 
of the amnesty -- detention, deportation and a ban on 
returning to the UAE to work. End comment.
