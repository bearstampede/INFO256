Classified By: A/ Pol Min Mary Witt for reasons 1.5(b) and (d) 
 
(C) Poloff provided Ruth Archibald, DFAIT's Senior 
Coordinator for International Crime and Terrorism, with 
information on the qualifications of Ambassador Melvyn 
Levitsky, the U.S. candidate for the International Narcotics 
Control Board, on July 31.  Archibald indicated that Canada 
has already submitted the nomination of retired Health Canada 
official Dann Michols for membership on the INCB. She further 
indicated that Canada has heard there will be two INCB 
vacancies, but added that has not yet been confirmed. 
Archibald said that if there are two board vacancies, she did 
not foresee a conflict between the U.S. and Canadian 
candidates, as each would bring different strengths to the 
board. Arcibald said that they would be willing to discuss a 
possible geographic conflict resulting from the U.S. and 
Canadian candidacies, if there is only one open seat. 
Archibald indicated they will provide post with further 
background information on Michols.
