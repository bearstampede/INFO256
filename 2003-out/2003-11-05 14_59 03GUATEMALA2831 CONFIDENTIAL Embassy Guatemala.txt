SUBJECT: PRESIDENT PORTILLO WILL VETO ELECTION HOLIDAY LAW 
 
REF: A. GUATEMALA 2796 
 
     ¶B. GUATEMALA 2827 
 
Classified By: PolCouns David Lindwall for reason 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) President Portillo called the Ambassador early on the 
morning of November 5 to say that he would veto the election 
holiday law, as he had promised.  Congress did not hold a 
special session to revise the bill on November 4, and the 
Executive Decree of November 3 (signed by Vice President 
Reyes Lopez in Portillo's absence) had not resolved the 
problem.  With tensions mounting and growing international 
pressure for a veto, Portillo has assured us he will veto it 
today.  Foreign Minister Gutierrez also called to Ambassador 
to tell him the controversial law would be vetoed today. 
 
¶2. (C) Comment:  The removal of the holiday law will ease 
tensions going in to the final days of the election campaign, 
but it will not fully restore confidence in the opposition 
that is waiting to see if the FRG has any other election week 
surprises up their sleeves.  The FRG leadership has promised 
us (and the OAS, EU and MINUGUA) that they will be well 
behaved.
