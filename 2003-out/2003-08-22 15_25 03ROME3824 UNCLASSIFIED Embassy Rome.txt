¶1. (U) PRIOR TO THE RECEIPT OF REFTEL, EMBOFFS HAD CONTACTED 
THE TRANSPORT MINISTRY TO REQUEST THAT ITALY ACCEPT EMBASSY 
NOTE 657 AS THE US DESIGNATION OF POLAR AIR CARGO.  OUR 
CONTACT, DR. ALDO SANSONE, TRANSPORT AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
MINISTRY DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, IS ON 
VACATION UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1, BUT WAS CONTACTED BY HIS STAFF 
REGARDING THE US REQUEST.  THE MINISTRY RESPONDED THAT IT 
AGREED IN PRINCIPLE WITH THE IDEA OF A BLANKET AUTHORIZATION 
    BUT THAT IN PRACTICE, ENAC IS CORRECT IN REQUIRING A SINGLE 
DESIGNATION FOR EACH COMPANY THAT INITIATES SERVICES. 
EMBOFFS SUBSEQUENTLY DELIVERED THE TEXT OF REFTEL NOTE TO THE 
TRANSPORT MINISTRY.  WE WILL NOTIFY WHEN A RESPONSE IS 
RECEIVED.
