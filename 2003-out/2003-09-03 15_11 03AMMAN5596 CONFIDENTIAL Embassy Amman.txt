¶1.  (C)  PolCouns on September 3 covered ref points on Iraq 
and the roadmap with Ali al-Ayed, Director of Foreign 
Minister Muasher's Private Office.  On Iraq, PolCouns thanked 
the GOJ for its recent public reception of an Iraqi Governing 
Council (GC) delegation and encouraged the GOJ to continue to 
work cooperatively with the GC, arguing that it is important 
that GC representatives be given the opportunity to address 
the upcoming Arab League Ministerial meeting, and participate 
in the upcoming UNGA.  Ayed said that there would be a 
meeting in Cairo on September 8 (i.e. just before the 
Ministerial meeting itself) that would determine what role 
the GC would play in the Ministerial meeting. 
 
¶2.  (C)  On the roadmap, PolCouns emphasized the vital 
importance that the PA act now to dismantle terrorist 
infrastructure.  He asked the GOJ to continue to assist PA PM 
Abbas and to do all it can to shut off the flow of funds to 
HAMAS and other terrorist groups.  Ayed responded that Jordan 
agrees with these points, but believes that the U.S. and the 
international community must also convince Israel to live up 
to its roadmap commitments, specifically by ending targeted 
assassinations, stopping construction of the separation wall, 
and ceasing all settlement construction. 
 
¶3.  (U)  CPA Baghdad minimize considered.
