TAGS: EAIR PTER CA
SUBJECT: QUESTIONS ON THE "NO FLY" LIST 
 
REF: 02 OTTAWA 3271 
 
Classified By: Classified by Minister Counselor for Economic Affairs Mi 
chael F. Gallagher for reasons 1.5 (c),(f),(g). 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request; see para 4. 
 
¶2.  (C) Post continues to seek information about the TSA 
"no-fly list (ref. a)."  Our understanding from discussions 
with TSA is that there is a written policy on the no-fly list 
that describes, among other things, information that is to be 
shared with foreign governments, and with U.S. and foreign 
air carriers.  We also understand that TSA provides the 
no-fly list itself to air carriers worldwide, to certain 
Canadian government officials, and to certain U.S. agencies. 
 
¶3.  (C) Several agencies at post deal regularly with Canadian 
officials on matters related to terrorism and aviation 
security policy and operations. In addition, the Department 
of Homeland Security Bureau of Customs and Border Protection 
(DHS/CBP) has approximately 400 inspectors serving as 
preclearance officers at seven Canadian airports. 
Preclearance inspectors have observed that, on occasion, 
names that are on the no-fly list have not been found in the 
Treasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS) widely used 
by DHS/CBP inspectors. 
 
¶4. (C) Action Requests:  Please provide the policy on the 
no-fly list.  We also request that no-fly lists be made 
available on a regular and timely basis to DHS/CBP inspectors 
and other appropriate USG personnel at the Embassy and other 
locations in Canada.
