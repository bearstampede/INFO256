SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT VOA'S STUDIO 7 UNDER FIRE; HARARE 
 
  ¶1.   Information and Publicity Minister Professor Jonathan 
      Moyo has accused the United States and Britain of 
      toughening "their hostility towards Zimbabwe," by "churning 
      out propaganda about regime change" through the Voice of 
      America's (VOA) Studio 7 channel on Zimbabwe.  Speaking 
      after meeting an Iranian delegation - in the country on a 
      five-day working visit to assist in the revamping of the 
      ZBC's television and frequency modulation (FM) network - at 
      his Munhumutapa offices in Harare on July 29, Moyo is 
      quoted as saying: "the United States Government was sowing 
      seeds of division among people in rural areas using a radio 
      station known as Studio 7."  Excerpts of the article 
      printed on page 4 under headline "`U. S., Britain intensify 
      hostility towards Zim.'" follow: 
 
  ¶2.   "The U. S. and Britain have intensified their 
      hostility towards Zimbabwe by setting up a broadcasting 
      station targeting the country's rural people and churning 
      out propaganda about regime change. . .The Minister of 
      State for Information and Publicity, Professor Jonathan 
      Moyo said the U. S. Government was sowing seeds of division 
      among people in rural areas using a radio station known as 
      Studio 7. . .The minister deplored the actions of the U. S. 
      government and urged Zimbabweans to rise and stand firm 
      against the U. S. and British propaganda.  Professor Moyo. 
      . .He said areas such as Victoria Falls and Kariba which 
      have poor reception should be given priority as they were 
      exposed to hostile broadcasting by the British and 
      Americans.  `Where we celebrate our won culture, the idea 
      of a superpower imposing its will on the rest of the world 
      is totally unacceptable. . . ."
