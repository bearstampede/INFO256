¶1. SUMMARY. THE 17TH SESSION OF THE UN FOOD AND 
AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE 
(COAG) MET MARCH 31 - APRIL 4, 2003.  COAG PROVED ONCE 
AGAIN TO BE THE MOST POLITICIZED OF FAO'S TECHNICAL 
COMMITTEES. ONLY ONE AGENDA ITEM RATED CONSENSUS 
ENDORSEMENT; THE REMAINDER WERE EITHER SENT BACK FOR RE- 
WRITING OR VIEWED AS TOO FLAWED TO WARRANT AN UNQUALIFIED 
ENDORSEMENT.  THE AGENDA, LARGELY SET BY THE SECRETARIAT, 
PITTED CAIRNS GROUP COUNTRIES (AND THE U.S.) AGAINST EU 
MEMBERS ON "THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE" (UNDER THE "THE 
FOOD CHAIN" ITEM) AND "MULTIFUNCTIONALITY" (UNDER "GOOD 
AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES").  NON-CAIRNS GROUP G-77 MEMBERS 
SAVED THEIR FIRE FOR THE WHO/FAO REPORT ON DIET ON 
NUTRITION, EXPRESSING CONCERN THAT RECOMMENDATIONS ON 
SUGAR INTAKE WOULD HAVE A DELETERIOUS EFFECT ON SUGAR 
PRODUCING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND REQUESTING THE REPORT 
BE CONSIDERED AT THE NEXT COAG.  LOOKING AHEAD TO THE 
NEXT BIENNIUM'S PROGRAM OF WORK, DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES WERE ABLE TO RALLY AROUND THE NEED TO 
STRENGTHEN FUNDING FOR THE PLANT HEALTH STANDARD-SETTING 
WORK OF THE INTERIM COMMISSION ON PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES 
(ICPM).  U.S. AND AUSTRALIAN EFFORTS TO CURTAIL FUNDING 
OF THE CONTROVERSIAL "FOOD CHAIN" PROGRAM SHOULD SEND A 
SIGNAL TO THE SECRETARIAT THAT FAO SHOULD FOCUS ON BOTTOM- 
UP AGRICULTURAL INITIATIVES, RATHER THAN CHURNING OUT 
GLOBAL "FRAMEWORKS" AND "STRATEGIES."  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  THE 17TH SESSION OF THE FAO COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE 
(COAG) MET IN ROME MARCH 31 - APRIL 4, 2003.  ONE HUNDRED 
AND TWENTY FAO MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETING.  THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01658  01 OF 06  171333Z 
AGENDA INCLUDED: A PROPOSAL ON "FAO'S STRATEGY TOWARDS A 
FOOD CHAIN APPROACH FOR FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY"; A 
PROPOSAL ON "A FRAMEWORK FOR GOOD AGRICULTURAL 
PRACTICES"; FURTHER WORK ON THE FAO "BIOSECURITY" 
PROPOSAL (FIRST INTRODUCED AT THE LAST COAG); THE PROGRAM 
IMPLEMENTATION REPORT, MEDIUM TERM PLAN AND BUDGET 
PROPOSALS FOR THE BIENNIUM 2004-2005.  A SUMMARY OF THE 
WHO/FAO STUDY ON DIET AND NUTRITION APPEARED AS AN 
INFORMATION ITEM.  SIDE EVENTS OF NOTE INCLUDED A DYNAMIC 
(AND VERY POSITIVE) PRESENTATION FROM FAO'S 
INTERDEPARTMENTAL WORKING GROUP ON BIOTECHNOLOGY. 
 
¶3.  THE U.S. DELEGATION WAS HEADED BY AMBASSADOR TONY 
HALL AND COMPRISED THE FOLLOWING DELEGATES: ADELA 
BACKIEL, DIRECTOR OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, USDA; BOBBY 
RICHEY, DIRECTOR, FOOD SAFETY AND TECHNICAL SECURITY, 
FOREIGN AGRICULTURAL SERVICE (FAS), USDA; RICHARD HUGHES, 
USDA/FAS; SHARON KOTOK, FOREIGN AFFAIRS OFFICER, OFFICE 
OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AFFAIRS, DEPARTMENT OF STATE; 
RALPH CUMMINGS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, BUREAU OF ECONOMIC 
GROWTH, AGRICULTURE AND TRADE, USAID AND U.S. MISSION 
REPRESENTATIVES LUCY TAMLYN AND KATIE NISHIURA.  THE 
REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA CHAIRED THE MEETING.  THE U.S. 
REPRESENTED NORTH AMERICA ON THE DRAFTING COMMITTEE AND 
CHAIRED THE DRAFTING COMMITTEE. 
 
PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION REPORT 2000-2001 
--------------------------------------- 
¶4.  THE FAO DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM PLANNING AND BUDGET 
ADVISED DELEGATES THAT THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION REPORT 
(PIR) WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING REVISED.  MEMBERS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01658  01 OF 06  171333Z 
WELCOMED NEWS OF AN IMPROVED REPORTING FORMAT BASED ON A 
NEW RESULTS-BASED PROGRAMMING MODEL WHICH WILL ENABLE 
MEMBERS TO BETTER ASSESS FAO'S PERFORMANCE AND UNDERSTAND 
THE LINKAGES BETWEEN ACTIVITIES AND ACHIEVEMENTS AND 
PROGRAM PRIORITIES.  IN REVIEWING PAST YEARS' PROGRAMS, 
MEMBERS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
STANDARD-SETTING BODIES, SUCH AS THE CODEX ALIMENTARIUS 
AND INTERNATIONAL PLANT PROTECTION CONVENTION (IPPC) AND 
TRADE-RELATED CAPACITY BUILDING. 
 
MEDIUM TERM PLAN AND PRELIMINARY PROPOSALS FOR WORK AND 
BUDGET 2004-2005 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶5. AMBASSADOR TONY P. HALL DELIVERED THE U.S. 
INTERVENTION ON THE MEDIUM-TERM PLAN 2004-2009 AND THE 
PRELIMINARY PROPOSALS ON THE PROGRAM OF WORK AND BUDGET, 
2004-2005.  THE U.S. STATEMENT EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE 
OF FAO DEPLOYING ITS LIMITED RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY IN 
SUPPORT OF GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY AND ASSISTING POOR 
FARMERS IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND INCOMES.  IT UNDERSCORED 
THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING THE SERIOUS IMPACT OF 
HIV/AIDS ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN 
AFRICA AND STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WTO-RECOGNIZED

FOOD SAFETY AND PLANT HEALTH STANDARD SETTING BODIES AND 
OF SUPPORT FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY TO MEET GLOBAL FOOD 
PRODUCTION NEEDS. 
 
¶6.  AS IN OTHER FAO COMMITTEES, MEMBERS WELCOMED THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE BUDGET PROPOSALS IN ADVANCE OF 
THE FAO COUNCIL.  DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (CHINA, INDIA, 
INDONESIA, ZIMBABWE) EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT FOR FAO'S 
SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR FOOD SECURITY (SPFS), CALLING IT 
"VERY USEFUL" (INDONESIA) AND "PRODUCING TANGIBLE 
RESULTS" (CHINA).  MOST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES EMPHASIZED 
THE NEED FOR GREATER CAPACITY BUILDING AND TRAINING.  THE 
REPUBLIC OF KOREA SUPPORTED A ZERO REAL GROWTH (ZRG) 
BUDGET, BUT NOTED THAT ZRG DIDN'T HAVE TO MEAN "NO 
GROWTH" FOR IMPORTANT PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE INTERIM 
COMMISSION ON PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES (ICPM).  DEVELOPED 
AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ALIKE EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR 
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE ICPM'S WORK PROGRAM. 
 
SETTING PRIORITIES - WHOSE JOB? 
------------------------------- 
 
¶7. IN HIS INTRODUCTION TO THE MEDIUM TERM PLAN AND THE 
BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR 2004-2005, DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM 
BUDGET AND PLANNING, TONY WADE, ARGUED THAT REAL BUDGET 
INCREASES WERE NEEDED IN ORDER TO SATISFY ALL THE NEEDS 
IDENTIFIED BY MEMBERS.  HE COMMENTED THAT, SINCE MEMBERS 
WERE UNABLE TO PRIORITIZE (AND THE SECRETARIAT COULD 
NOT), THE ONLY SOLUTION WAS FOR MEMBERS TO LOBBY THEIR 
AUTHORITIES TO APPROVE A REAL GROWTH BUDGET.

PAGE 03        ROME  01658  02 OF 06  171334Z 
 
COMMENT:  OECD MEMBERS WERE UNIFORMLY UNHAPPY WITH THE 
SECRETARIAT'S STATEMENT; THE EU INTERVENED A SECOND TIME 
 
SIPDIS 
TO STATE THAT THE SECRETARIAT SHOULD TAKE A MORE ACTIVE 
ROLE IN GUIDING MEMBERSHIP IN SETTING PRIORITIES. 
IRONICALLY, THE ONE PROGRAM INDICATED BY USDEL AND 
AUSTRALIA AS LOW PRIORITY (THE ETHICS PROGRAM) WAS SAVED 
AFTER FRANTIC SECRETARIAT LOBBYING ON THE FLOOR SUCCEEDED 
IN PERSUADING A MEMBER (COSTA RICA) TO SUPPORT IT.  END 
COMMENT. 
 
GLOBAL FORUM ON FOOD SAFETY REGULATORS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  UNDER THE PROGRAM OF WORK AND BUDGET, MEMBERS ALSO 
DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVENING IN 2004 (IN A 
DEVELOPING COUNTRY) A SECOND GLOBAL FORUM OF FOOD SAFETY 
REGULATORS WHICH WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE STANDARD-SETTING 
WORK OF THE CODEX ALIMENTARIUS COMMISSION.  FUNDING WOULD 
BE REQUIRED. 
 
FOOD CHAIN STRATEGY 
------------------- 
 
¶9.  THE FAO INTRODUCED ITS "STRATEGY FOR A FOOD CHAIN 
APPROACH FOR FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY."  THE ITEM 
ORIGINATED IN THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON WORLD FOOD 
SECURITY IN 2002 WHICH HAD REQUESTED THAT COAG OUTLINE 
FAO'S STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS KEY POLICY ADVICE, CAPACITY 
BUILDING, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ACTIONS THAT NEED TO 
BE TAKEN AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS FOR 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01658  02 OF 06  171334Z 
ENSURING ACCESS TO SAFE AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD. MANY 
COUNTRIES EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE FAO PAPER 
SIGNIFICANTLY ENLARGED AND ALTERED THE ORIGINAL CFS 
REQUEST (NOT LEAST BEING TO ADD "QUALITY").  THE U.S. 
RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROCESS USED TO ARRIVE AT THE 
APPROACH AND THE USE OF VAGUE, UNDEFINED TERMS SUCH AS 
"HOLISTIC", "PRUDENT APPROACH" AND "TRACEABILITY." 
AUSTRALIA ARGUED THAT A FOOD CHAIN APPROACH SHOULD NOT BE 
SADDLED WITH "COLLATERAL" ISSUES SUCH AS SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT AND COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL TREATIES; 
NOR SHOULD THE FOOD CHAIN TAKE ON ACTIVITIES MORE 
PROPERLY BELONGING TO THE MARKET (SUCH AS SATISFYING 
CONSUMER TASTES).  MOST COAG MEMBERS FELT THAT "A" FOOD 
CHAIN APPROACH TO FOOD SAFETY WAS ACCEPTABLE (AND WAS, IN 
FACT THE APPROACH THAT GUIDED MANY COUNTRIES 
DOMESTICALLY) BUT EXPRESSED DIFFERING OPINIONS ON THE 
SCOPE AS PRESENTED BY FAO. THE IMPORTANCE OF SCIENCE- 
BASED RISK ASSESSMENT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL MEMBERS AS 
WELL AS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CAPACITY 
BUILDING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THE ROLE OF CODEX, 
IPPC AND OIE IN ANY FOOD CHAIN APPROACH. HOWEVER, THE 
EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND LIKE-MINDED COUNTRIES INDICATED 
THAT ETHICS AND THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE SHOULD BE 
INCLUDED IN THE "FOOD CHAIN APPROACH."  CAIRNS GROUP

COUNTRIES TOOK THE FLOOR AGAIN TO DISAGREE WITH THIS 
APPROACH. 
 
FOOD CHAIN -- LINKING BUDGETS WITH PROGRAMS 
------------------------------------------- 
¶10.  AS THE COMMITTEE COULD NOT REACH CONSENSUS ON THE 
DOCUMENT, AUSTRALIA AND U.S. DEL SOUGHT TO ENSURE THAT 
THE PROPOSED BUDGET (SOME USD 950,000) WOULD NOT BE SPENT 
ON THE FOOD CHAIN STRATEGY IN THE NEXT BIENNIUM BUT WOULD 
BE USED INSTEAD FOR HIGHER PRIORITY ITEMS (SUCH AS THE 
ICPM).  THE NEGOTIATED OUTCOME INCLUDES A REQUEST FOR THE 
SECRETARIAT TO RE-DRAFT THE PAPER AND RE-SUBMIT TO THE 
 
SIPDIS 
NEXT COAG SESSION.  THE REPORT ALSO NOTES THAT "A FEW 
MEMBERS FELT THAT THE PROPOSED BUDGET ALLOCATION FOR THIS 
WORK WOULD NEED TO BE REVIEWED." 
 
¶11. COMMENT:  THE DEEP DISAGREEMENT OVER THE FAO'S 
PROPOSED STRATEGY FOR A "FOOD CHAIN APPROACH" PRESENTED A 
NOVEL OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS TO LINK PROGRAMS WITH 
RESOURCES (OR, IN THIS CASE, TO ATTEMPT TO DENY FUNDING 
TO A PROGRAM WHICH DID NOT MEET WITH CONSENSUS APPROVAL). 
NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE EFFORTS OF AUSTRALIA, SUPPORTED BY 
THE U.S., TO BLOCK FUNDING FOR "FOOD CHAIN" ACTIVITIES 
PROVOKED A STORM OF PROTESTS (NOT LEAST -- BUT MUFFLED, 
OF COURSE-- FROM THE SECRETARIAT).  RECOGNIZING THAT SUCH 
A TACTIC MUST BE USED JUDICIOUSLY, AS IT COULD WELL BE 
TURNED AGAINST ONE'S OWN PRIORITY PROGRAMS, AUSTRALIA AND 
THE U.S. EVENTUALLY BACKED OFF.  THE LANGUAGE OF THE 
REPORT MAKES CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT COAG AT NO POINT 
"ENDORSED" THE DOCUMENT.  IT ALSO LEAVES AN IMPORTANT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01658  03 OF 06  171334Z 
TRAIL TO BE FOLLOWED UP ON BY THE UPCOMING PROGRAM AND 
FINANCE COMMITTEES, WHICH ARE THE APPROPRIATE BODIES TO 
TAKE FURTHER ACTION ON THIS ISSUE.  END COMMENT. 
 
GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES 
---------------------------- 
 
¶12. THE FAO'S PROPOSED "FRAMEWORK FOR GOOD AGRICULTURAL 
PRACTICES" (GAP) REVIEWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LIST OF 
GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES FOR FAO TO USE IN ITS 
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WITH MEMBER NATIONS TO 
FURTHER ACTIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND RURAL 
DEVELOPMENT.  MEMBERS GENERALLY SUPPORTED THE NOTION OF 
GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES ALTHOUGH (WITH THE EXCEPTION 
OF THE EU) THEY REFUSED TO CONSIDER IT A "FRAMEWORK" OR A 
SYSTEM.  RATHER, MOST COUNTRIES EMPHASIZED THAT THERE 
WERE DIVERSE WAYS TO APPROACH GAP AND THAT A GAP APPROACH 
SHOULD BE VOLUNTARY, NON-REGULATORY, NOT IMPLY ANY GLOBAL 
STANDARD AND NOT CREATE NEW BARRIERS TO TRADE.  THE 
LINKAGE BY THE DELEGATE OF POLAND OF GAP TO 
MULTIFUNCTIONALITY AROUSED CONCERNS IN CAIRNS GROUP AND 
THE U.S. THAT THE GAP "FRAMEWORK" MIGHT BE A STALKING 
HORSE FOR MULTIFUNCTIONALITY.   THE PAPER WILL BE 
REVIEWED AT THE NEXT COAG. 
 
SUSTAINABLE RURAL LIVELIHOODS 
----------------------------- 
 
¶13.  MEMBERS GENERALLY SUPPORTED THE WORK OF FAO IN 
INTEGRATING A RURAL LIVELIHOOD APPROACH INTO ITS EXISTING 
PROGRAMS, IN PARTICULAR THE FAO'S SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01658  03 OF 06  171334Z 
FOOD SECURITY (SPFS).  RURAL LIVELIHOODS IN THIS INSTANCE 
MEANS PARTICIPATORY APPROACHES THAT HELP EMPOWER RURAL 
COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN DIVERSIFYING RURAL 
INCOMES, SUPPORTING GOOD GOVERNANCE ACTIVITIES, AND 
BUILDING CAPACITY OF SMALL FARMERS AND RURAL BUSINESSES. 
COAG NOTED THAT WORK NEEDED TO FOCUS ON AREAS OF FAO'S 
COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE AND FOSTER PARTNERSHIPS FOR GREATER 
EFFICIENCIES AND COLLABORATION. COAG REQUESTED FURTHER 
INFORMATION ON SUCCESS STORIES WHERE THE LIVELIHOODS 
APPROACH HAS REDUCED RURAL POVERTY.  (COMMENT: THE REAL 
SUCCESS STORY HERE IS THAT OF THE UK DELEGATION, WHICH, 
BY STRATEGICALLY PLACING A UK-FUNDED DFID ADVISOR IN FAO 
HAS INTEGRATED THE UK'S MAJOR DEVELOPMENT THEME INTO FAO 
PROGRAMS.  END COMMENT.) 
 
AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION AND DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶14. REGRETTABLY THERE WAS NOT MUCH INTEREST OR COMMENT ON 
THIS IMPORTANT AGENDA ITEM.  MEMBERS SUPPORTED 
INTENSIFIED WORK IN DEVELOPING AGRO-ENVIRONMENTAL

BETTER USE OF AGRO-ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION AND DATA IN 
THEIR COUNTRIES.  DEVELOPED COUNTRIES' COMMENTS FOCUSED 
ON BETTER COORDINATION WITHIN EXISTING INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS AND DATA COLLECTION METHODOLOGIES. 
 
BIOSECURITY IN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶15. COAG DISCUSSED THE TOPIC OF BIOSECURITY FOR A SECOND 
TIME. (THE TOPIC WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED AT THE 16TH 
SESSION OF COAG).  THE U.S. RE-EMPHASIZED ITS VIEWS FROM 
THE 16TH SESSION AND EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE VAGUE 
AND WIDE-RANGING NATURE OF THE DOCUMENT AND THE LACK OF A 
DEFINITION OF BIOSECURITY. MANY COUNTRIES HIGHLIGHTED 
THAT CAPACITY BUILDING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WERE KEY 
IN ADDRESSING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES NEEDS FOR ANIMAL 
HEALTH, PLANT HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY. THE COMMITTEE 
AGREED THAT NO CHANGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY 
FRAMEWORKS WAS NEEDED AND REAFFIRMED THE ROLE OF CODEX, 
IPPC AND OIE (THE INTERNATIONAL OFFICE OF EPIZOOTICS). 
 
PORTAL ON FOOD SAFETY, ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶16. DURING DISCUSSION OF BIOSECURITY, THE COMMITTEE ALSO 
ENDORSED THE CONCEPT OF AND FURTHER WORK ON THE U.S.- 
FUNDED INTERNATIONAL PORTAL ON FOOD SAFETY, ANIMAL AND 
PLANT HEALTH AND LOOKED FORWARD TO ITS OFFICIAL LAUNCH. 
AT THE LAST PLENARY THE BRAZILIAN DELEGATION ASKED FOR AN 
ADDITIONAL SENTENCE TO BE ADDED TO REPORT: "THE COMMITTEE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  01658  04 OF 06  171335Z 
EXPRESSED ITS UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PORTAL WOULD ONLY 
INCLUDE SCIENCE-BASED INFORMATION, DATA AND/OR DECISIONS 
AND GUIDELINES OF AN INTER-GOVERNMENTAL NATURE, AS WELL 
AS ANY NATIONAL OFFICIAL DATA AND INFORMATION." THE EU 
OBJECTED TO THE ADDITION.  A PROPOSAL BY ERITREA TO DROP 
"ONLY" WAS ACCEPTED AND THE AMENDED PROPOSAL WAS ADDED TO 
THE FINAL REPORT. 
 
WHO/FAO STUDY ON DIET AND NUTRITION 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶17. UNDER OTHER BUSINESS, MEMBERS AND OBSERVERS COMMENTED 
ON AN INFORMATION DOCUMENT SUMMARIZING THE WHO/FAO REPORT 
ON DIET, NUTRITION AND THE PREVENTION OF CHRONIC 
DISEASES.  A NUMBER OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES EXPRESSED 
CONCERN THAT RECOMMENDATIONS ON SUGAR INTAKE COULD HAVE 
AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON SMALL SUGAR PRODUCERS AND THE 
ECONOMIES OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.  OBSERVERS FROM 
INDUSTRY GROUPS ARGUED FOR SCIENCE-BASED FINDINGS.  USDEL 
INTERVENED TO STATE THAT THE "BEST POSSIBLE SCIENTIFIC 
AND PUBLIC HEALTH EVIDENCE SHOULD BE THE CORNERSTONE OF 
THE 2004 GLOBAL STRATEGY ON DIET, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND 
HEALTH." WHILE THE REPORT WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE AN 
ACTION ITEM FOR ANY FAO INTERGOVERNMENTAL BODY, MEMBERS 
REQUESTED THAT THE SECRETARIAT CONVENE COAG "AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE" SO THAT MEMBERS COULD "REVIEW" THE REPORT. 
COMMENT: NEITHER WE (NOR THE SECRETARIAT) KNOW WHEN THIS 
WILL BE.  THE NEXT MEETING OF COAG IS IN 2005. END

WITH ONE TO TWO LOST ON A WEEKLY BASIS. 
 
COMMENT:  THE SECRETARIAT'S COMMENTS ON A POSSIBLE TREATY 
ON ANIMAL GENETIC RESOURCES INDICATED THAT THEY MAY BE 
WAY AHEAD OF MEMBERS ON THE DESIRABILITY OF SUCH A 
TREATY.  FODAG HAS FOLLOWED UP WITH THE SECRETARIAT TO 
POINT OUT THAT THE LAST COMMISSION ON GENETIC RESOURCES 
SESSION DID NOT ENDORSE ANY GROUNDWORK BEING DONE ON A 
REATY.  END COMMENT.

INITIATIVE IS  MULTI-STAKEHOLDER PROCESS DESIGNED TO 
DEVELOP AN SUPPORT PARTNERSHIPS AND INITIATIVES TO 
STRENGTEN ON THE GROUND ACTIONS TO SUSTAINABLE

SEARCH FOR FUNDING OF PROJECT PROPOSALS; ESTBLISHMENT OF

BY THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN AND FAO): JAPAN NOTED THAT THE 
AGRICULTURE AND WATER DECLARATION WAS ONE OF THE MORE 
SUCCESSFUL ASPECTS OF THE FORUM AND THAT THE FORUM WOULD

-- BRIDGING THE RURAL DIGITAL DIVIDE - INFORMATION AND 
COMMUNICATION IN SUPPORT OF RURAL LIVELIHOODS:  THE 
PRESENTATION EXAMINED "A NEW APPROACH" TO BRIDGE THE 
INFORMATION GAP FOR RURAL STAKEHOLDER WHO ARE LACK ACCESS 
TO APPROPRIATE COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES WHICH CAN HELP 
ALLEVIATE HUNGER AND POVERTY IN RURAL AREAS BY BRINGING 
THEM INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF INFORMATION. 
 
-- WORLD BANK ASSESSMENT ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: 
ROBERT WATSON OF THE WORLD BANK PRESENTED THE OUTLINE OF 
THE PROPOSED ASSESSMENT ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND THE 
DECISION MAKING PROCESS. IT APPEARED FROM THE 
PRESENTATION THAT THE ASSESSMENT'S PROPOSED SCOPE HAS 
MOVED TOWARDS MORE FOCUS ON TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE AND 
ITS CONTRIBUTION TO AGRICULTURE IN THE FUTURE AND DE- 
EMPHASIZED OTHER NON-MARKET AND TRADE ISSUES.  FAO IS ONE 
OF THE MAIN PARTNERS LEADING THE ASSESSMENT. 
 
-- FAO AND BIOTECHNOLOGY:  THE HEAD OF FAO'S 
INTERDEPARTMENTAL WORKING GROUP ON BIOTECHNOLOGY, JAMES 
DARGIE (ALSO DIRECTOR OF FAO'S JOINT DIVISION WITH THE 
INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY IN VIENNA) PRESENTED 
FAO'S BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS. THE PRESENTATION WAS VERY 
BALANCED AND VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY. 
 
COMMENT:  MISSION MEMBERS WERE FAVORABLY STRUCK BY THE 
EXTENT TO WHICH DARGIE WAS PREPARED TO CHALLENGE BIOTECH 
DOUBTERS AND NAYSAYERS IN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD 
WITH STRONG AND UNEQUIVOCAL ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF 
BIOTECH.

¶19. THE NEXT REGULAR SESSION OF COAG IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE 
PLACE IN ROME IN EARLY APRIL 2005.  COAG SUPPORTED THE 
SUGGESTION OF THE DELEGATE OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA THAT 
FAO REPORT TO THE FINANCE AND PROGRAM COMMITTEES ON THE 
POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING COAG AND THE COMMITTEE ON 
COMMODITY PROBLEMS BACK TO BACK WITH A VIEW TO FINDING 
SAVINGS AND IMPROVING EFFICIENCY. 
 
COMMENT - IS IT THE TOPIC OR THE PRESENTATION? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶20.  COAG PROVED ONCE AGAIN TO BE THE MOST POLITICIZED OF 
FAO'S TECHNICAL COMMITTEES.  ONLY ONE ITEM OF THE AGENDA 
RATED CONSENSUS ENDORSEMENT (AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL 
INFORMATION AND DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS).  THE REMAINDER 
WERE EITHER SENT BACK FOR RE-WRITING ("THE FOOD CHAIN") 
OR VIEWED AS TOO FLAWED TO WARRANT AN UNQUALIFIED 
"ENDORSEMENT."  WHILE TRADE ISSUES CANNOT BE ENTIRELY 
AVOIDED, WE BELIEVE THAT THE FAO SHOULD FOCUS ON BOTTOM- 
UP AGRICULTURAL INITIATIVES, RATHER THAN CHURNING OUT 
GLOBAL "FRAMEWORKS" AND "STRATEGIES" (ESPECIALLY WHEN 
THESE INCLUDE A THINLY VEILED "PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE" 
DRESSED UP AS "A PRUDENT APPROACH.")  WE HOPE THAT U.S. 
AND AUSTRALIAN EFFORTS TO CURTAIL FUNDING OF THE
