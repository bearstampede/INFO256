¶1.  (C)  A/DCM covered ref points on the Iraq discussion at 
the OIC summit with Ali al-Ayed, personal assistant to 
Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher.  A/DCM emphasized that UNSCR 
1441 found Iraq in material breach and that Iraq must comply 
immediately and fully with 1441.  It is also crucial that any 
OIC statement send the clear message that the only way for 
Iraq to avoid serious consequences is to comply immediately, 
actively, and unconditionally with 1441.  Ayed noted that 
Prime Minister Ali Abul Ragheb and Minister of State for 
Foreign Affairs Shaher Bak would represent Jordan in Doha. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Al-Ayed called back March 5 to report that the U.S. 
perspective had been well aired in the OIC discussions in 
Doha.  In fact, he said with some glee, the Kuwaiti and Iraqi 
representatives had gotten into a heated exchange on live TV, 
with the Iraqi calling the Kuwaiti "kelb (dog) and worse."
