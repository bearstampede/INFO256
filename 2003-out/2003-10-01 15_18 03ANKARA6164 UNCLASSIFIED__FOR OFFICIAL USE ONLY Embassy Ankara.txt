LEGISLATION 
 
 
(SBU) During a September 30 meeting with ATC Chairman 
Scowcroft, Prime Minister Erdogan asked what had happened to 
the Qualifying Industrial Zone legislation.  In an October 1 
conversation with MFA Deputy U/S Alev Kilic, DCM asked for 
clarification of Erdogan's question.  Kilic responded that 
the GOT was still interested in QIZ legislation, even with 
textiles excluded, and would welcome legislation along the 
lines of that discussed last year. He added that the MFA 
expected the issue to be on the agenda for December's EPC 
meeting.
