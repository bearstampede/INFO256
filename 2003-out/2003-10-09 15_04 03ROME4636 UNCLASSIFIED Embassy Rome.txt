SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN, CASE 05-897361 
 
REF: A. STATE 253311 
 
     ¶B. MILAN 00641 
 
¶1. THIS MESSAGE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING 
PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK ON LICENSE NUMBER 05-897361, THE 
EXPORT OF FOCAL PLANE ARRAYS TOTALLING USD 14,500 (REF A) TO 
    THE CARLO GAVAZZI COMPANY. 
 
¶2. CONSULATE MILAN OFFICERS MET WITH COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES 
AND CONDUCTED AN ON-SITE INSPECTION OF THE COMPANY AS 
REPORTED IN REFTEL (B), AND CONCLUDED THAT THE FIRM APPEARED 
TO BE LEGITIMATE AND ENGAGED IN THE ACTIVITIES IT CLAIMED TO 
BE.  HOWEVER, THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SENT A LETTER 
TO THE EMBASSY DATED SEPTEMBER 29, 2003, INDICATING THAT THE 
FIRM DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE OFFICIAL REGISTRY OF ITALIAN 
COMPANIES ALLOWED TO TRADE IN SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGIES. 
 
¶3. ACCORDING TO THE AERONAUTICS DIVISION OF THE GOI MINISTRY 
OF DEFENSE, THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN THE C130J PROGRAM OF 
TRADING IN COMMERCIAL SATELLITES.  IN ADDITION, THE MOD 
ASSURED THE EMBASSY THAT THE COMPANY ALSO HAS A JOINT VENTURE 
WITH L3 COMMUNICATIONS, A LOCKHEED-MARTIN SUBSIDIARY. 
 
¶4. THE MOD RESPONSE CLEARS UP THE CONFUSION AND CONFIRMS A 
SATISFACTORY FINDING.  THE APPARENT CONTRADICTION BETWEEN 
EMBASSY'S REFTEL (B) FINDING AND THE MFA RESPONSE MAY ARISE 
BECAUSE THE GOI DOES NOT LIST THE TECHNOLOGY IN QUESTION AS 
SENSITIVE AND POTENTIALLY DUAL-USE.
