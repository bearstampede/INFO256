(U) Classified by Pol-Mil Counselor Stuart Brown.  Reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
¶1.  (C) On April 7, in response to Post's follow up on Ref A, 
acting MFA Cyprus Department Head Barkan Oz contacted 
polmiloff with an update on Turkey's intentions regarding the 
spring Toros I exercise in Cyprus.  Oz said that he had 
confirmed with the Turkish General Staff that Turkey has "no 
planned exercise" in Cyprus this spring.  He added that the 
only planned Turkish exercise on the island would be in the 
fall, but that it was still too early in the year for 
decisions on it now.  He reiterated that Turkey would mirror 
whatever the Greek/Greek Cypriot side did.  He said that if 
Alexandros/Olympos were to take place, the GOT would 
"evaluate it and take a corresponding position." 
 
 
¶2.  (C) Comment: The Turks do not seem aware that Alexandros 
took place on February 3-7 as a command post exercise with no 
troops deployed (Ref B), nor did we seek to inform them. 
Inasmuch as the Greek/Greek Cypriot side considers its spring 
exercises concluded, we can expect the Turks to stick to not 
having plans for Toros I.  End Comment.
