SUBJECT: MFA MINSTATE:  ARAB LEAGUE COMMUNIQUE FAR 
LESS DAMAGING THAN AL-JAZEERA REPORTING 
 
REF:  STATE 75616 
 
¶1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR MARCELLE M. WAHBA 
FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D). 
 
¶2.  (C)  AMBASSADOR DELIVERED REFTEL DEMARCHE ON 
THE AFTERNOON OF 3/23 TO MFA MINSTATE SHAYKH 
HAMDAN BIN ZAYID (OTHER TOPICS SEPTEL, NOTAL). 
SHAYKH HAMDAN NOTED THAT NOT MUCH COULD BE 
EXPECTED FROM THE ARAB LEAGUE SESSION, SINCE LIBYA 
WOULD BE CHAIRING.  UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE 
UAE WOULD ATTEND AT A LOWER LEVEL -- EITHER THEIR 
AMBASSADOR IN CAIRO OF PERHAPS THEIR ASSISTANT 
UNDERSECRETARY FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS.  THE 
MINSTATE SHARED OUR CONCERNS REGARDING THE LIKELY 
TONE AND CONTENT OF THE COMMUNIQUE TO EMERGE FROM 
THE CAIRO MEETING.  SHAYKH HAMDAN IMPLIED, 
HOWEVER, THAT ARAB LEAGUE STATEMENTS ON IRAQ 
SHOULD BE THE LEAST OF OUR WORRIES AT THIS TIME. 
HE EXPOUNDED AT LENGTH ON THE EXTREMELY 
SENSATIONALISTIC AND BIASED REPORTING ON QATAR'S 
AL-JAZEERA SATELLITE TELEVISION CHANNEL, SAYING IT 
IS HAVING "TEN TIMES" MORE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ARAB 
PUBLIC OPINION THAN ANYTHING THAT WILL EMERGE FROM 
TOMORROW'S SESSION IN CAIRO.
