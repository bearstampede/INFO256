REF: A. STATE 98747 
     ¶B. STATE 95180 
     ¶C. GUATEMALA 995 
 
Classified By: Ambassador John Hamilton for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) In the absence of Foreign Minister Gutierrez, Embassy 
raised ref A points with Giovanni Castillo, Director General 
for Multilateral Affairs on April 21.  Castillo assured us 
that the GOG would immediately inform the Embassy of any 
cases of former Iraqi regime officials attempting to enter 
Guatemalan territory.  Castillo added that in the wake of our 
previous demarche on this subject (refs B and C), he had been 
in consultations with the Ministry's Legal Department 
regarding procedures for potential asylum claims by Iraqi 
officials.  The GOG would look to the Embassy for 
information, coordination, and support, he said, in any such 
claims. Castillo said he doubted any Iraqi officials would 
attempt to take refuge in Guatemala but repeated his 
assurances that we would be immediately consulted if the GOG 
detects possible Iraqi officials in Guatemala.
