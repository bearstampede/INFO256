SUBJECT:  CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR CONFIRMS STATUS OF RAFIDAIN BANK IN UAE 
 
REF: TREASURY DTG 221921Z JAN 03 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Charge D'Affaires Thomas Williams for reasons 1.5 
(b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (C) In a meeting with Charge on February 3, UAE Central Bank 
Governor Sultan Al- Suweidi confirmed that a single branch of Rafidain 
Bank operates in Abu Dhabi, but its activities are very limited and 
closely scrutinized by the Central Bank. According to the Governor, the 
bank does not conduct retail banking operations, but rather manages a 
static asset portfolio of USD $3-4 million (excluding an approximate 
USD $11 million in reserves required by the Central Bank). 
 
¶3.  (C) Note: Local contact information for Rafidain Bank is as 
follows: P.O. Box 2727, Abu Dhabi, phone numbers +971 (2) 
6335882/6335883/6310302/6326996 and 6323231 (manager's line). 
End note. 
 
Williams
