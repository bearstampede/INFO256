¶1. (U) Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Deutsch. 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
¶2. (C) On June 12, we delivered ref A demarche, following up 
on ref B demarche (reported in ref C). The GOT has gone over 
ElBaradei's report with great care and fully concurred with 
USG concerns over Iran's pattern of deception with regard to 
its nuclear program. MFA Disarmament Head Ibrahim Yagli 
promised full support for the USG approach for the June 16 
Board of Governors meeting. He also expressed thanks for the 
non-paper, noting that it would be valuable in the crafting 
of the GOT's national statement for the June 16 meeting. 
 
 
¶3. (C) Yagli also stressed the need for appropriate follow-up 
to the June 16 meeting, to ensure that the issue of Iran's 
nuclear program continues to receive close attention by the 
Board. He concurred with the proposal in ref A for another DG 
report to a special Board session before the next regularly 
scheduled Board meeting. However, he suggested that the Board 
go one step further by also requesting more frequent, 
"informal," reports on inspections in Iran by the IAEA 
Secretariat (whether orally, in written format, or both). 
 
SIPDIS 
These "spot" reports would lead up to the formal DG report. 
(COMMENT: We believe Yagli's suggestion is quite useful and 
recommend full consideration by Washington.)
