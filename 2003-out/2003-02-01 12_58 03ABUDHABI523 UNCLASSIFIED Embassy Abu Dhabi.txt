Econoff delivered reftel demarches to the Office of Minister 
of State for Financial and Industrial Affairs and defacto 
Minister of Finance Mohamed Khalfan bin Khirbash on January 
Â¶29.  Khirbash heads the newly formed Federal Customs 
Authority of the UAE under the aegis of the Ministry of 
Finance.  We will seek a meeting in the coming weeks to 
check on the status of the Federal Customs Authority -- 
which should regularize customs procedures across the UAE 
and provide a single POC within the UAEG on customs issues - 
- and elicit Khirbash's views on the new cargo manifest 
rules, in particular.
