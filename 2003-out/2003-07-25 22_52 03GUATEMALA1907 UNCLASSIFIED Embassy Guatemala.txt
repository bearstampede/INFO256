SUBJECT: VIOLENT STREET PROTESTS OVER--FOR NOW 
 
REF: GUATEMALA 1906 AND PREVIOUS 
 
As of 1700 local time, police and media sources confirm that 
the pro-Rios Montt street demonstrations have ended. 
Television broadcasts show the areas around the various court 
buildings previously occupied by protesters are now deserted. 
 The buses that brought the protesters into the capital are 
now carrying them back into the interior.  While this round 
of demonstrations is over for now, protests could emerge 
again as Rios Montt's legal case proceeds through the courts.
