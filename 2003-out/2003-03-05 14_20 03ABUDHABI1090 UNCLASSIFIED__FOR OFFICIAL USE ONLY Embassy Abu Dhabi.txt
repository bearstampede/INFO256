SUBJECT:  UAE LABOR UNIONS WILL BE "FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL" 
 
REF: ABU DHABI 941 
 
¶1. (U) An editorial published on March 3 by a well-regarded 
economic commentator lauded the recent Ministry of Labour draft 
proposal to formally establish labor unions (reftel).  Salah Al 
Halyan, managing director of Gulf Insurance Consulting and an 
editorial columnist for the Gulf News, wrote that "unions will 
soon exist in this part of the world; a great move which will 
provide for improved work conditions and protection of workers' 
rights leading to higher work standards.  The winds of change are 
certainly blowing in our direction, for the benefit of all." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Al Halyan's comments are indicative of the 
positive reception the draft proposals have received. While 
workers already enjoy considerable informal rights to organize 
and request redress of grievances  (strikes, though infrequent, 
are not uncommon here), regulations to formerly recognize these 
rights present further progress towards the establishment in the 
UAE of a fully modern economy, as desired by both business and 
government leaders here.
