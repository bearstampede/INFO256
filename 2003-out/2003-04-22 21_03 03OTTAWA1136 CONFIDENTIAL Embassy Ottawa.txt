E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/22/2013 
TAGS: PREL CA OSCE
SUBJECT: CANADA RULES OUT BID FOR OSCE CHAIR 
 
REF: A. STATE 101332 B. USOSCE 184 
 
Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) Poloff conferred with Lisa Helfand, Deputy Director of 
the NATO/NORAD section in DFAIT's International Security 
Bureau, on April 22 concerning Canada's interest in the OSCE 
chairmanship.  Helfand indicated that Canada has decided not 
to be a candidate for the OSCE chair in 2006, for a couple of 
reasons. First, a decision to seek the chairmanship would 
need to be made by the Prime Minister, and Canada will have a 
new prime minister in less than a year's time. Second, while 
acknowledging that holding the OSCE chair makes sense for 
Canada politically and in terms of its foreign policy 
interests, Helfand indicated the costs and logistics involved 
in serving as chair from this side of the Atlantic are 
prohibitive for Canada. (Comment: The financial burden cited 
by Helfand would also seem to argue against future OSCE 
chairmanships for Canada.)
