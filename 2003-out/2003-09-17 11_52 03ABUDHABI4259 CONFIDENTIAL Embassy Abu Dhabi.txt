SUBJECT:  UAEG WANTS WORLD BANK/IMF TO GRANT IGC 
FULL STATUS AT DUBAI SUMMIT 
 
Ref: Ambassador Wahba-Jones 9/16/03 e-mail 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, Reasons 
1.5(b) and (d). 
 
¶2. (C) Abdullah Rashid Al-Noaimi, MFA Under Secretary for 
Political Affairs, told the Ambassador on September 17 
that the UAEG is deeply concerned that the Iraqi Governing 
Council (GC) may only be granted observer status -- not 
full status -- at the upcoming World Bank/IMF summit in 
Dubai.  "We are pushing as we did in the Arab League" to 
secure a seat for the GC in that forum, Abdullah Rashid 
said.  "We want the Iraqis to represent Iraq in the World 
Bank meetings.  We have asked for the help of other 
countries to support that," he said. 
 
¶3. (C) The Ambassador said the U.S. agreed with the UAEG 
position and added that she would be surprised if the World 
Bank did not let the GC sit in the Iraq chair.  Abdullah 
Rashid said it was important to give "visible authority" to 
the GC and the interim government.  That would give them 
more credibility, he added.  Abdullah Rashid acknowledged 
that this would be an interim arrangement until the Iraqis 
have a constitution, elections, and a government.
