SUBJECT: HARARE LABOR LEADERS RELEASED, MOST WITHOUT CHARGES 
 
REF: A. HARARE 2259 
 
     ¶B. HARARE 2257 
 
¶1. (SBU)  All of the Harare-area labor detainees have now 
appeared before the court, with only four being charged under 
the Public Order and Security Act (POSA), and the rest 
released without charges.  Those leaders answering charges 
are:  Lovemore Matombo, President of the Zimbabwe Congress of 
Trade Unions (ZCTU) and President of the Communication 
Workers; Wellington Chibebe, Secretary-General of the ZCTU; 
Lucia Matibenga, Vice President of the ZCTU and President of 
the Commercial Workers; and Elisa Mlotshwa, Vice President of 
the ZCTU and President of the Clothing Workers union. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Some labor sources speculate that the GOZ's failure 
to bring charges against most  detainees may be a political 
as much as a legal decision.  Although the prosecutors 
reportedly conceded to the detainees that there was little 
chance of successful prosecution even under the POSA, one 
labor observer believes that the GOZ is trying to avoid as 
much controversy as possible in advance of a hoped-for, 
last-minute invitation to the Commonwealth Heads of 
Government Meeting (CHOGM).  Regardless of the reason, the 
majority of the detainees have now been spared a long-running 
and expensive defense against the GOZ's widely-criticized 
security laws. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶3. (SBU)  The hastily called two day stayaway, which garnered 
very little support, was cancelled upon the release of the 
labor leaders.  The consensus among observers seems to be 
that this was an ill-advised move, called by the second 
string leadership, that had little hope of success from the 
start. Communication (in the absence of independent new 
sources, reftels) remains a key problem, and it is 
increasingly difficult to get the entire picture.  Labor 
sources are likewise constrained, both in disseminating and 
gathering information as indicated by their lack of 
information on some detainees in the outlying areas.  Further 
similar protests are likely, since many labor leaders doubt 
that any change will come without increased confrontation. 
As the stakes increase, many of the labor activists are 
taking courage from the fact that the eyes of the world are 
watching.  End comment.
