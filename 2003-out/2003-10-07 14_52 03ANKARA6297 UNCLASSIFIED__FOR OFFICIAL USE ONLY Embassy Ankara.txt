Summary 
------- 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Topa Toker, Director General of Civil Aviation 
(DGCA), told us that the Transport and Communications 
Minister is very interested in achieving high standards 
for aviation safety and security, and in maintaining a 
cooperative relationship with USG aviation authorities. 
He suggested that the FAA Administrator forward a copy 
of FAA's safety review to Minister Yildirim as a means 
of maintaining positive momentum on this issue.  We also 
raised the Cape Town and Montreal Conventions and 
American Airlines' codeshare application.  End Summary. 
 
 
Safety and Security 
------------------- 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 3, we delivered an August 29 letter 
from Transportation Security Administration (TSA) 
Assistant Administrator Michael Robinson summarizing 
TSA's 2002 review of security at Ataturk International 
 
SIPDIS 
Airport in Istanbul, and noted that a TSA team would 
conduct another assessment during the week of October 
¶10. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Toker said that Transport Minister Binali 
Yildirim had become much more engaged in safety and 
security issues following his meetings with the 
Secretary of Transportation and the FAA Administrator in 
 
SIPDIS 
Washington last month.  The Minister is eager to 
maintain a cooperative relationship with the FAA and 
TSA.  Toker told us that the Minister called him 
 
SIPDIS 
following his (the Minister's) meeting with the 
Ambassador on October 1 (septel) to ensure that DGCA 
fully cooperates with the TSA team. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Toker told us that DGCA is working on a bill to 
administratively reform the agency and will submit it to 
the Minister in the next several weeks.  He expects the 
Minister to endorse it, but stated that FAA's support 
for the reform effort would be helpful.  In particular, 
he suggested that the FAA Administrator send a letter to 
the Transport and Communications Minister transmitting a 
copy of FAA's report on air safety issues. 
 
 
Cape Town Convention 
-------------------- 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Econoff and Econ Specialist inquired as to the 
status of Turkish ratification efforts for the Cape Town 
Convention on International Interests in Mobile 
Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment. 
Econoff explained that ratification could enable Turkish 
Airlines (THY) to qualify for a lower exposure fee if it 
were to seek U.S. Eximbank financing for a possible 
purchase of Boeing aircraft.  Toker said he would look 
into the ratification question.  He opined that THY 
might purchase or lease new airplanes, but the number of 
planes was likely to fall far short of 50.  Note:  THY 
told visiting Eximbank Board Member April Foley in 
September that THY might acquire as many as 50 new 
aircraft.  End Note.  We also requested information on 
the ratification process from MFA's Aviation Department, 
but have not yet received a response. 
 
 
American Airlines' (AA's) New Codeshare 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Econoff raised AA's application for a codeshare 
with British Airways (BA) on BA flights between London 
and Istanbul.  Toker responded that DGCA was aware of 
the request, but that AA had yet to file a complete 
application. 
 
 
Montreal Convention 
------------------- 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) Econoff delivered ref A points urging Turkey to 
join the Montreal Convention on airline accident 
liability.  Edelman
