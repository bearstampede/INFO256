REF: ABU DHABI 1399 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard A. Albright, for reasons 
1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
---------------- 
General Overview 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) COM convened Abu Dhabi's Iraq Task Force/core 
Emergency Action Committee (EAC) at 1000 local time, 3/25. 
Embassy Abu Dhabi, FCS (located outside of the Embassy 
compound), and the USGS office in Al Ain are open 3/25 with 
full staffing. 
 
--------------- 
Consular Issues 
--------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) The Consular Section noted an increase in visa 
services but reported no calls from concerned AMCITs. 
 
 
 
 
 
----------------------- 
UAEG Actions/Statements 
----------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) ECON confirmed UAEG approval of the establishment 
of a World Food Program warehouse in Dubai for humanitarian 
assistance to Iraq. ECON noted that the UAEG is gearing up 
for a major humanitarian assistance effort, to be 
coordinated via the Red Crescent Society. PAO mentioned 
that Dubai TV and radio are broadcasting a 12-hour 
fundraiser today to raise charitable donations for 
humanitarian relief in Iraq.  DCM directed ECON to report 
on the latest developments. (See septel). 
 
-------- 
Security 
-------- 
 
¶5.  (C) RSO reported that security inspection of American 
and FSN employees at the Embassy began today without any 
problems.  Inspections will continue on a random, but 
reoccurring basis. 
 
¶6.  (C) Currently on spring break vacation, the American 
Community School will reopen on Saturday, March 29.  The 
DCM directed ADMIN and RSO to talk with school officials to 
assess and recommend a security plan. 
 
¶7.  (C) RSO reported Abu Dhabi police responded to two 
generic bomb threats within the past few days at the 
Meridian Hotel and the Ajman College.  Police advised the 
buildings were not evacuated, but were searched with 
nothing found. 
 
¶8.  (S/NF) ORCA reported an e-mail sent to the police in 
Dubai threatening to kill U.S., U.K. and Australian 
citizens if they did not leave Dubai. The threat was not 
deemed credible. The PAO in Kuwait confirmed to ORCA that 
Jamail Ishmail, an Abu Dhabi TV correspondent formerly with 
Al-Jazeera and alleged to be a security threat, is not 
embedded with U.S. military forces in Iraq nor registered 
with U.S. press operations in Kuwait.  He is believed to be 
in Karachi. 
 
¶9.  (C) USLO confirmed that U.S. military forces in UAE 
moved from Force Protection Condition Delta to Charlie on 
3/24. 
 
-----------

coverage of the war in the Arabic language press.  Except

Khaleej, Al Bayan and Akhbar Al-Arab -- have taken largely 
anti-U.S. stances. 
 
¶11.  (U) Abu Dhabi Iraq Task Force/EAC will reconvene at 
1000 local time, 3/26. 
 
¶12.  (U) Iraq Task Force/EAC members in attendance included
