Classified By: CHARGE ALAN MISENHEIMER F0R REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
 ¶1. (S/NF) Information about the missing Boeing 727 has been 
shared with appropriate Yemeni officials in the MOD and MOI. 
The Yemen Air Force routinely monitors aircraft movements 
around the Horn of Africa region, and will be looking for the 
plane. 
 
¶2.  (S/NF) However, absent specific information about the 
plane's location, or the intentions of its crew, it is highly 
unlikely that the MOD could effectively deploy its limited 
air defense systems to protect USG installations such as the 
Embassy or MTT teams now in country.  We agree with the 
ROYG's own assessment - Yemen does not have the resources 
necessary to conduct operations like those outlined para 4 
reftel. 
 
¶3. (S/NF) Please advise if further action is required.
