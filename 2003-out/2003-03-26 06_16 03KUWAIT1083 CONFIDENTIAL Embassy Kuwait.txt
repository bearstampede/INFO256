Classified By: Ambassador Richard Jones for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) 
 
¶1. (C) Ambassador met with Kuwaiti Central Bank (CBK) 
Governor Shaykh Salem AbdulAziz Al-Sabah on March 23 to 
review the status of freeze actions by the Central Bank 
against accounts of the Lajnat Al-Daawa Al-Islamiyya (LDI). 
The Governor confirmed local press reports that KD 1.4 
million (nearly USD 4.6 million) had been seized, but said 
that represented only accounts in one institution.  He said 
the CBK was still compiling the details of accounts in other 
financial institutions under CBK control to arrive at a final 
amount.  Ambassador pressed the Governor to provide as many 
details about the accounts as possible, explaining that such 
information could prove invaluable to US and other 
investigators in "follow-the-money" type investigations 
relating to the financing of terrorism. 
 
¶2. (C) On March 24, Ambassador also raised the LDI freeze 
issue with Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Dr. 
Mohammad Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, expressing appreciation for 
GOK steps to block the accounts.  Per ref (B), the Ambassador 
also presented the MinState with a non-paper requesting 
additional information on the frozen accounts. Shaykh Dr. 
Mohammad said he would see what could be done to provide the 
requested information, but noted that LDI had a U.S. auditor 
(Baker and McKenzie) that should already have access to such 
information.
