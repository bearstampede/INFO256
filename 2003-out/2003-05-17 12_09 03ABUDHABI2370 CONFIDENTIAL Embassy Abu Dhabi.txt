SUBJECT: UAEG CONSIDERING RATIFICATION OF OPTIONAL 
PROTOCOLS TO RIGHTS OF CHILD CONVENTION 
 
REF: STATE 126276 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Acting Deputy Chief of Mission 
Thomas E. Williams for Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶2.  (C) On 17 March, Poloff delivered reftel demarche 
to MFA Legal Affairs Deputy Director Yacub Al-Hosani 
and encouraged the UAEG to consider ratifying the two 
Optional Protocols to the Rights of the Child 
Convention -- one on the involvement of children in 
armed conflict, the other on the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography.  (Note: The 
UAEG ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on 3 January 1997.  In addition, the UAEG 
ratified ILO Convention 182 Concerning Worst Forms of 
Child Labor on 28 June 2001.  End note.) 
 
¶3.  (C) Poloff encouraged the UAEG to ratify both 
Optional Protocols, noting that UAEG ratification of 
the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child 
Prostitution and Child Pornography would constitute 
another effort of the UAEG to monitor and combat 
trafficking in persons.  Al-Hosani noted that the MFA 
had recommended to the Ministry of Justice that these 
two optional protocols be considered for ratification. 
He continued that the UAEG was against the actions 
condemned in the two Optional Protocols and indicated 
that UAE law already criminalized the subject matter 
of the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, 
Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.  Al-Hosani 
undertook to follow-up on the status of the Ministry 
of Justice's action on the MFA's recommendation.  We 
will forward the UAEG's response when received.
