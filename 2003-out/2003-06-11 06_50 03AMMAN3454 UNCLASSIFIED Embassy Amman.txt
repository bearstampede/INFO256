SUBJECT: 2003 Jazz Ambassadors Fall Tour 
 
 
¶1.   PAS wishes to be included in the Jazz Ambassadors 
Program for the fall FY03.  We request the Jazz Ambassadors, 
Freddie Bryant and Kaleidoscope for four or five program 
days during their fall tour.  We are very enthusiastic about 
the opportunity. There is a great interest here in Latin 
jazz, but opportunities for live concerts are extremely 
scarce, airplay is limited, and CDs and tapes are relatively 
expensive for the general public. 
 
¶2. Program supports MPP goal of promoting Jordanian 
understanding and appreciation of U.S. society, culture and 
institutions.  In accordance with mission policy, the 
musicians will be met at the airport upon arrival.  During 
their program, staff will accompany them to all concerts, 
and other venues.  While in country, the musicians will be 
staying in RSO approved accommodations. 
 
¶3. In the aftermath of war in the region, it has become even 
more important to emphasize the universality of American 
culture and US interest in promoting strong ties with all 
sectors of Jordanian society.  Music is a natural venue for 
these ties, and Latin jazz is extremely popular with 
Jordanian youth from all strata of society, as well as with 
traditional Embassy contacts. Invitees will include members 
of the royal family, high-level officials, business leaders, 
academicians, artists, students and music lovers from the 
general public. Thank you for this opportunity.
