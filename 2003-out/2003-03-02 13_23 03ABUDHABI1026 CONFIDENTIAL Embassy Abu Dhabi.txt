SUBJECT:  UAE BUSINESSWOMEN'S COMMITTEE EXCITED ABOUT 
MEET U.S.; ASKS FOR UPDATE ON MEPI 
 
REFS: (A) ABU DHABI 726 (B) 02 ABU DHABI 5820 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by DCM Richard Albright for reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
¶2.  This is an action request; please see paragraph 5. 
 
¶3.  (C) Senior Comoff and Econoff met on March 1 with 
members of the Executive Council of the National 
Businesswomen's Committee in Abu Dhabi, who 
enthusiastically agreed to participate in the MEET 
U.S. program administered by the Department of 
Commerce, and will forward nominations to Post by the 
end of the week. The women were especially excited 
about the program's full week of basic business 
training since the Council had earlier discussed 
similar training (writing a business plan, managing 
business accounts, etc.) with visiting NEA/RA Director 
Gary Grappo in the context of MEPI. 
 
¶4.  (C) Members of the Executive Committee in Abu 
Dhabi recalled Grappo's visit to the UAE in February 
(ref A) and asked for an update on MEPI initiatives. 
Econoff noted that the MEET U.S. program is the type of 
exchange program envisioned under MEPI, but that 
additional specific programs -- including a UAE-focused 
businesswomen's mentoring initiative discussed 
generally by Grappo during his visit here -- are not 
yet in place. Comment: If the Executive Committee's 
reaction to the MEET U.S. program is any indication, 
MEPI programs for UAE businesswomen -- once they come 
to the UAE -- will be met with great enthusiasm.  End 
comment. 
 
¶5.  (C) Action request: In his meeting with the 
Executive Council, Grappo agreed to forward a list of 
prominent businesswomen in America, with whom the 
Council could explore the possibility of a U.S-UAE 
businesswomen-mentoring program. The Emiratis would 
like to have this list in advance of the first 
country-wide forum of UAE businesswomen on March 26-27 
in Dubai, in order to discuss "next steps" with 
conference participants.  Post would appreciate any 
input the Department could provide prior to March 26.
