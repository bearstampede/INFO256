REF: A. GNEHM/DANIN AND GNEHM/SECHE TELCONS 11/5/03 
 
     ¶B. AMMAN 7178 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm.  Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
Please see Para 3 Action Request. 
 
¶1.  (C)  Reconfirming information passed informally to the 
White House and State Department on the evening of November 5 
(ref a), Deputy Prime Minister Halaiqa told the Ambassador 
November 6 that Jordan would make an imminent transfer of 
frozen Iraqi assets to the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI). 
Halaiqa said the amount would be between $20 million and $25 
million. 
 
¶2.  (C)  In a separate conversation with ECON/C, Finance 
Minister Abu Hammour also confirmed this decision by the 
government, stating that the amount to be transferred would 
be $25 million.  He asked that we provide an account number 
and other technical information required to complete the 
transfer.  Abu Hammour said that other members of the 
government's economic team had been reluctant to transfer 
these funds, but that he had personally urged Prime Minister 
Faisal al-Fayez to approve a transfer in view of "everything 
the United States is doing for Jordan." 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Action Request.  Please confirm DFI account and 
other relevant information to embassy by cable or email 
(GoldbergerTH@state.gov).
