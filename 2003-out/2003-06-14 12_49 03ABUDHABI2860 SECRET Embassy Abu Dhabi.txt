 UAE DISMAYED BY NEW VIOLENCE 
 
REF:  A) STATE 157973 
 
      B) 02 ABU DHABI 3193 
 
¶1. (U) Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba 
for reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2. (S) The Ambassador delivered Ref A demarche on 
the need for governments to move decisively against 
entities providing financial support to Hamas in a 
June 11 meeting with MFA Minstate Hamdan (other 
topics covered septel).  Hamdan expressed 
appreciation for President Bush's position on the 
Israeli strike against Hamas leader Abdulaziz Al- 
Rantissi, noting the UAEG view that Israel seems 
bound and determined to wreck the roadmap, thus 
undoing the hard work of President Bush, the 
Quartet, the Europeans and moderate Arab leaders. 
He regretted the tit-for-tat violence that has 
erupted between the Israelis and Palestinians, 
fearing that this setback would only feed further 
extremism and increase regional instability. 
 
¶3. (S) UAE Armed Forces Chief of Staff Muhammad bin 
Zayid Al-Nahyan (MbZ), in a meeting with the 
Ambassador later the same day, said Israel's 
targeted assassinations of Hamas leaders created 
more "martyrs" for the extremist cause.  While 
Hamas is strengthened by these attacks, Abu Mazen 
and the Palestinians who need our collective 
support are further marginalized. 
 
¶4. (S) The Ambassador briefed both Emirati leaders 
on the appointment of Ambassador John Wolf, noting 
his intention to travel to the region by the end of 
the week to coordinate implementation of the 
roadmap. 
 
¶5. (S) Hamdan shared that the Israelis had broken 
into the Jerusalem-based office of the UAE Red 
Crescent Authority not long ago.  The office was 
ransacked and a number of files taken.  Hamdan has 
dispatched an emissary to speak with GOI officials 
about the break-in and convey the UAEG's desire to 
work together in the future. 
 
¶6. (S) Comment:  The Emiratis have little tolerance 
for those individuals and organizations providing 
financial support for Hamas.  The leadership has 
demonstrated its commitment to do the utmost 
possible to end such support coming from private 
sources in the UAE (Ref B) and we are currently 
working with the UAEG to investigate the activities 
of a UAE-based NGO -- Human Appeal International -- 
which has been linked with providing support for 
Hamas, among other terrorist organizations (see 
septel).  End Comment.
