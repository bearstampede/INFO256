SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ:GERMAN, FRENCH, AND RUSSIAN MARCH 15 JOINT 
DECLARATION 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT, 
REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
¶1. (U) ON MARCH 15, GERMAN PERMREP PLEUGER CIRCULATED THE 
FOLLOWING GERMAN, FRENCH, AND RUSSIAN JOINT DECLARATION ON 
IRAQ AS AN ANNEX TO A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL. 
 
¶2. (U) BEGIN TEXT OF GERMAN, FRENCH, AND RUSSIAN JOINT 
DECLARATION. 
 
-- THE SHARED GOAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS THE 
DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ PURSUANT TO THE DECISIONS OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL.  SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1441 
(2002), ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY, PROVIDES FOR AN UNPRECEDENTED 
INSPECTIONS REGIME. 
 
-- WE REAFFIRM THAT NOTHING IN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES 
JUSTIFIES ABANDONING THE INSPECTIONS PROCESS OR RESORTING TO 
FORCE. 
 
-- THE SUCCESSIVE REPORTS OF MR. HANS BLIX AND MR. MOHAMED 
ELBARADEI HAVE SHOWN THAT THE INSPECTIONS ARE PRODUCING 
RESULTS.  THE DISARMAMENT OF IRAQ HAS BEGUN, AND THERE IS 
EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN BE COMPLETED RAPIDLY AND 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES SET OUT BY THE COUNCIL.  IRAQ, 
FOR ITS PART, MUST COOPERATE ACTIVELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY. 
 
-- FRANCE, GERMANY AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, SUPPORTED BY 
CHINA, HAVE SUBMITTED PROPOSALS FOR ACHIEVING THAT OBJECTIVE 
BY DEFINING KEY DISARMAMENT TASKS AND ESTABLISHING A RIGOROUS 
TIMETABLE. 
 
-- SUGGESTIONS IN THE SAME SPIRIT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD BY 
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.  THE UNITY OF THE COUNCIL CAN 
BE PRESERVED ON THE BASIS OF THESE EFFORTS, IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH THE PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED BY RESOLUTION 1441 (2002). 
ALL MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL BEAR A PARTICULAR RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR ENSURING THAT IT IS NOT DIVIDED AT THIS CRUCIAL TIME. 
 
-- THE PROGRAMME OF WORK OF THE UNITED NATIONS MONITORING, 
VERIFICATION AND INSPECTION COMMISSION (UNMOVIC) IS TO BE 
SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL ON TUESDAY.  WE PROPOSE THAT THE 
COUNCIL SHOULD THEN MEET AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL TO APPROVE 
KEY DISARMAMENT TASKS AND ESTABLISH AN IMPLEMENTATION 
TIMETABLE WHICH IS BOTH DEMANDING AND REALISTIC. 
 
-- THE USE OF FORCE CAN BE ONLY A LAST RESORT.  A PEACEFUL 
APPROACH IS PREFERRED BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND SUPPORTED 
BY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY; WE 
SOLEMNLY APPEAL TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL TO MAKE EVERY 
EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT SUCH AN APPROVAL PREVAILS.
