¶1.  As reported in Ref B, as of April 2002 Sri 
Lanka's Central Bank had frozen the assets of a 
single account suspected of financing the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, designated by the 
U.S. under E.O. 13224 on November 2, 2001. 
 
¶2.  The Controller of Exchange of Sri Lanka's 
Central Bank confirmed on March 24, 2003 that the 
account in question is no longer frozen.  The 
Controller said the account was unfrozen because 
the Central Bank found no evidence to indicate the 
account was linked to terrorism.
