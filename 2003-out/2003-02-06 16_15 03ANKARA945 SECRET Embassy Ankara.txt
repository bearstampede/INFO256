SUBJECT: IRAQ: TURKISH MFA U/S ZIYAL AND AMBASSADOR PEARSON 
DISCUSS MILITARY AND POLITICAL MOU'S 
 
 (U) Classified by Ambassador W. Robert Pearson.  Reasons: 
1.5 (B and D). 
 
 
¶1. (S) Ambassador met with MFA U/S Ugur Ziyal mid-afternoon 
February 6 to press on several issues.  First, he got from 
Ziyal a commitment to have the MFA, Treasury and other 
concerned agencies available during the holiday next week 
from Wednesday on to close on any outstanding questions. 
Ziyal said he had given instructions to the MFA to have 
critical, i.e., Iraq- related, offices staffed, and he knew 
Treasury would also be available. 
 
 
¶2. (S) Secondly, Ambassador explained why a "political MOU" 
was unacceptable, pointing out interalia the dangers to 
Turkey if such a document were misinterpreted as a U.S.- 
Turkey political blueprint for Iraq and the region.  He said 
he understood, but that Turkey "is in a difficult spot."  "We 
have to have," he said, a document that the "PM can use to 
convince the Parliament that the political concerns of Turkey 
have been met, and the U.S. and Turkey are in agreement."  He 
asked for suggestions, and Ambassador told him to think in 
terms of a statement.  He asked if "Statement of Political 
Principles" might work?  (Note: Amb Khalilzad is currently 
meeting with his Turkish counterpart on the substance of the 
U.S. instructed paper, and we will have a fuller report to 
forward from that meeting. End Note). 
 
 
¶3. (S) On the third issue, Ambassador said the mil-to-mil MOU 
negotiations needed closing instructions from the MFA 
leadership.  In those talks, we now were trying to resolve 
taxation, claims and criminal jurisdiction questions, 
Ambassador said.  He explained that we were offering creative 
solutions for taxation and claims questions, but that the 
criminal jurisdiction issue is fundamental for the U.S. side. 
  Ziyal said he would discuss these points with the Turkish 
negotiator.  As Ambassador left Ziyal,s office, the Turkish 
negotiator walked in, apparently to brief Ziyal on the 
discussions.  (Note: the U.S. team, led by Ambassador Lino, 
has informed the Turks that we will stay tonight as late as 
possible to close on the issues.  End Note).
