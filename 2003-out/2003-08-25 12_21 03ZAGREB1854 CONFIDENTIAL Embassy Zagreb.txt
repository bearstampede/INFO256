E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/21/2013 
TAGS: KPKO MARR PREL LI HR UN
SUBJECT: LIBERIA: CROATIAN SUPPORT FOR UN PEACEKEEPING 
PROBABLY NOT AIR ASSETS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 242664 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF JUSTIN FRIEDMAN, REASONS 1.5 (B) & (D) 
 
¶1. (U) POLOFF DELIVERED REFTEL DEMARCHE TO ACTING NORTH 
    AMERICA DESK DIRECTOR ANDREA BEKIC ON AUGUST 21.  BEKIC 
COMMENTED THAT THE GOC WAS REVIEWING HOW IT COULD CONTRIBUTE 
TO THE NEW MISSION TO LIBERIA.  SHE CAUTIONED THAT DEPENDING 
ON THE FINAL SCOPE OF THE GOC CONTRIBUTION, PARLIAMENTARY 
APPROVAL COULD BE REQUIRED. 
 
¶2. (C) BEFORE RECEIPT OF REFTEL INSTRUCTIONS, MOD HAD 
INDICATED TO DAO IN CONFIDENCE THAT THE CROATIAN UN 
DELEGATION WAS ENGAGED IN EXPLORATORY DIALOGUE REGARDING 
PARTICIPATION IN PEACE KEEPING OPERATIONS (PKO) IN LIBERIA 
AND WOULD VIEW ANY SOLICITATIONS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS FAVORABLY. 
 UPON DELIVERY OF REFTEL MOD INDICATED PLANNING FOR A 
LIBERIAN PKO HAD BEEN KEPT IN CLOSE-HOLD IN SENIOR CHANNELS 
AND WOULD REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE 
BEFORE ANY FORMAL RESPONSE WAS GIVEN. 
 
¶3. (C) CONTRARY TO REFTEL, WE BELIEVE CROATIA IS NOT/NOT IN A 
POSITION TO OFFER AIR ASSETS. CROATIAN INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS 
HAVE FOCUSED ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO HQ STAFF.  WE NOTE THAT 
CROATIA ALSO HAS INFANTRY ASSETS THAT COULD BECOME AVAILABLE 
FOR THIS MISSION IF NOT OTHERWISE SLATED FOR POSSIBLE 
CONTRIBUTION TO KFOR, BUT WE DO NOT/NOT HAVE A FIRM 
COMMITMENT FROM THE MOD AT THIS TIME.  CROATIA'S CAPABILITY 
TO DEPLOY FORCES OVERSEAS IS LIMITED.  WITH AN MP PLATOON IN 
AFGHANISTAN AND A UNIT OF SPECIAL OPS FORCES TRAINING FOR 
POSSIBLE DEPLOYMENT TO IRAQ, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT CROATIA'S 
MOD WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE 
SUPPORT OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA. 
 
¶4. (U) MONROVIA MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
