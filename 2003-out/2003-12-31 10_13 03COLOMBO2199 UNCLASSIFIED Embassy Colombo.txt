¶1.  Summary:  Hoping to begin off-shore oil 
prospecting soon, the Sri Lanka Government intends to 
announce its plans to international oil companies at 
a workshop in early 2004.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  The Government plans to open areas in the Mannar 
Basin off the north-western coast of Sri Lanka for 
oil exploration.  Keen to engage the participation of 
international oil companies, the GSL will hold a 
workshop in Colombo for interested companies in the 
first quarter of 2004.  At this workshop, the terms 
and conditions for exploration and general 
information on petroleum prospects of the area, the 
regulatory environment, business climate and 
incentives will be announced.  Following the 
workshop, the GSL hopes to issue oil exploration 
licenses to about nine companies through a 
competitive bidding process. 
 
¶3.  The Parliament has recently approved a new 
Petroleum Resources Act to facilitate oil exploration 
by private companies.  The Act provides for the 
establishment of a Petroleum Resources Development 
Committee and a Petroleum Resources Secretariat to 
coordinate exploration activities.  The GSL is also 
in the process of finalizing petroleum operation 
regulations and model contracts under the new Act.
