U.S. DOLLAR 480,000 AIMED AT MORE TIGHTLY LINKING FAO/WFP

REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS CILSS AND SADC. US MISSION STRONGLY 
ENDORSES THIS OUTREACH BY FAO AND WFP TO STRENGTHEN UN 
LINKAGES WITH TWO IMPORTANT SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN REGIONAL

¶2. BEGIN TEXT OF FAO-WFP LETTER TO US MISSION. "DEAR MR. 
LAVELLE: 
 
AS YOU KNOW, THE FAO AND WFP FREQUENTLY ORGANIZE JOINT CFSA 
(CROP AND FOOD SUPPLY ASSESSMENT) MISSIONS TO CARRY OUT 
RAPID OVERALL ASSESSMENTS OF THE FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
SITUATION IN COUNTRIES IN A STATE OF CRISIS. THESE MISSIONS 
RELY TO A GREAT EXTENT UPON SECONDARY DATA AND LOCAL 
EXPERTISE; REPRESENTATIVES FROM NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OR 
DONOR AGENCIES ARE ALSO INVOLVED, ALTHOUGH THE ULTIMATE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ASSESSMENT RESTS WITH THE UNITED 
NATIONS. WE EXPECT TO DO SIX SUCH MISSIONS IN SOUTHERN 
AFRICA IN APRIL/MAY OF THIS YEAR, AND WILL DO OVER TWENTY IN 
THE COURSE OF 2003, INCLUDING SOME TO SUDAN, ETHIOPIA, THE 
KOREA DPR AND AFGHANISTAN. 
 
DONOR AGENCIES RELY ON VARIOUS INFORMATION SOURCES TO MAKE 
DECISIONS ON FOOD AID AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTIVITIES, BUT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  01984  01 OF 03  081328Z 
THE FAO/WFP ASSESSMENTS USUALLY FIGURE PROMINENTLY, 
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THEIR RECOGNIZED INDEPENDENCE AND 
UNBIASED JUDGMENT. NEVERTHELESS, THERE IS A CLEAR SENSE 
AMONG ALL PARTIES, INCLUDING WITHIN FAO AND WFP, THAT THE 
CFSAS MUST BECOME MORE PRECISE AND RELIABLE. THIS IS DUE 
PARTLY TO THE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX NATURE OF MANY 
EMERGENCIES, AND TO THE RECOGNITION THAT THESE ASSESSMENTS 
OUGHT TO BE MORE COMPREHENSIVE, FOR EXAMPLE, BY USING MORE 
SYSTEMATICALLY NATIONAL FOOD BALANCE RATHER THAN CEREAL 
BALANCE SHEETS. 
 
THE RELEVANT SERVICES AT FAO AND WFP HAVE ALREADY TAKEN A 
NUMBER OF STEPS TO IMPROVE THEIR RESPECTIVE CFSA 
METHODOLOGIES AND THE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH THEY UNDERTAKE 
THESE JOINT MISSIONS. FOR INSTANCE, WE HAVE: 
 
- DEFINED THE COMMON PURPOSE OF CFSAS AND THE SPECIFIC 
OBJECTIVES OF BOTH PARTIES; 
- IDENTIFIED SPECIFIC METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES TO BE REFINED, 
BOTH ON THE FAO AND WFP SIDES (E.G. ESTIMATES OF COMMERCIAL 
IMPORTS TO FILL A DOMESTIC FOOD SUPPLY GAP, MORE 
COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL FOOD BALANCE ANALYSES, 
DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN CHRONIC AND TRANSITORY FOOD

-- AND BETWEEN THE TWO INSTITUTIONS -- WE PROPOSE TO 
ORGANIZE AND MANAGE A WIDER EXPERT CONSULTATION PROCESS, TO 
TAKE PLACE OVER A PERIOD OF UP TO ONE YEAR AND A HALF. THIS 
WOULD INCLUDE SPECIALISTS FROM FAO, WFP, DONOR AGENCIES, 
SPECIALISTS FROM REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS (FROM THE SOUTHERN 
AFRICA DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) OR THE (CILSS) THE SAHEL 
PERMANENT INTER-STATE ANTI-DROUGHT COMMISSION) AND 
INDEPENDENT EXPERTS. THE EXPERT CONSULTATION WOULD DRAW UPON 
INTERNAL RESOURCES AT FAO AND WFP, WOULD BE MANAGED JOINTLY 
BY THESE TWO INSTITUTIONS (WITH SEPARATE AND CLEARLY DEFINED 
SCOPES AND BUDGETS), AND WOULD REQUIRE SEVERAL WORKING 
MEETINGS/WORKSHOPS. THIS EXPERT CONSULTATION COULD INCLUDE, 
AMONG OTHER THINGS: 
 
- SEVERAL SHORT COMMISSIONED PAPERS, PRESENTATIONS; 
 
- COLLABORATION BETWEEN SEVERAL FAO SERVICES AND CILSS TO 
FINALIZE ONGOING WORK TO MOVE FROM CEREAL BALANCE TO FOOD 
BALANCE SHEETS FOR SELECTED COUNTRIES IN THE CILSS REGION. 
THE PRECISE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE WORK NEED TO BE 
DETERMINED THROUGH DISCUSSIONS THE CILSS; 
 
- COLLABORATION BETWEEN SEVERAL FAO SERVICES AND SADC ON THE 
INTEGRATION OF EARLY WARNING INFORMATION INTO THE FAO'S 
CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF THE FOOD SITUATION AT THE COUNTRY 
LEVEL, AND INTO THE FAO/WFP JOINT CROP AND FOOD SUPPLY 
ASSESSMENTS. HERE TOO, THE PRECISE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE 
WORK NEED TO BE DETERMINED THROUGH ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS 
WITH SADC; 
 
- IN-DEPTH DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL PARTIES ON ALL ELEMENTS OF

PAGE 04        ROME  01984  02 OF 03  081328Z 
THE PROCESS: PREPARATION AND BRIEFING OF TEAMS, IN-COUNTRY 
ASSESSMENTS, PARTICIPATION, IN-COUNTRY BRIEFING, FINALIZING 
THE CONCLUSIONS AND REPORT. 
AMONG SPECIFIC OUTPUTS, OR TANGIBLE RESULTS, FROM THIS 
EXPERT CONSULTATION, WE ENVISAGE THE FOLLOWING: 
 
- UPDATED VERSIONS OF THE CURRENT FAO AND WFP METHODOLOGIES 
ON JOINT CFSAS; 
 
- A COMMON HANDBOOK FOR FAO/WFP TEAMS (AND PARTNERS) ON 
PRACTICAL STEPS TO JOINT CFSAS.  THIS HANDBOOK WOULD REFER 
TO, BUT BE MUCH MORE CONCISE, THAN THE RESPECTIVE 
METHODOLOGIES, AND WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN THREE LANGUAGES 
(ENGLISH, FRENCH AND SPANISH, MOST LIKELY); 
 
- THE JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF MORE COMPREHENSIVE FOOD BALANCE 
SHEETS FOR SELECTED CILSS COUNTRIES; 
 
- CLARIFICATION OF RESPECTIVE ROLES, AND SPECIFIC 
COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH SADC'S EARLY WARNING UNIT ON 
CFSAS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA; 
 
- TRAINING OF A FIRST GROUP OF 20 PERSONS IN THE USE OF THE 
 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, BECAUSE OF THEIR MAJOR CONTRIBUTION

WE BELIEVE THAT THIS EXPERT CONSULTATION WOULD BE A VERY 
EFFICIENT, PARTICIPATORY AND TRANSPARENT WAY TO IMPROVE A 
KEY COMPONENT OF DECISION MAKING THROUGH WHICH VERY LARGE 
FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS ARE MADE, TO ASSIST NEEDY POPULATIONS.
