began viewing Turkey as a trump card in their relations with 
the Middle East.  The EU's foreign policy chief Javier 
Solana said at the WEF meetings in Jordan that full

businessmen's association TUSIAD as well.

complaint by Prime Minister Erdogan's lawyers on grounds of 
insult and libel, the prosecutor's office has initiated an 
investigation into Genc Party leader Cem Uzan's remarks

prosecutor to demand up to three years prison sentence for 
Uzan, papers say.  If convicted, Uzan will be banned from 
politics.

parliamentary commission against corruption has demanded 
investigation against a number of certain political figures

Kretschner said special efforts are needed for 
implementation of EU reforms, and noted that EU funds would 
be spent for education and, social and cultural projects in 
southeast Turkey. 
 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION:  Iran / Iraq 
 
 
"Iran" 
Ozgen Acar observed in social democrat-intellectual 
Cumhuriyet (6/24): "It is interesting to see some comments 
calling for the US to intervene in Iran as they did in Iraq. 
The regime in Iran is not only an enemy to Turkey and its 
secular system, but also it is hostile to democracy.  Yet I 
would not sympathize with `the US should intervene in Iran' 
rationale.  . It is a well-known fact that at least during 
the last 10 years Iran has been working on a nuclear weapons 
development program.  Dictatorships such as Iran may use 
nuclear weapons unexpectedly and this possibility itself is 
a great threat to Turkey. . However, the motives behind the 
nuclear armament should also be inquired into.  Iran's 
nuclear weapons development began with the need to establish 
a defense or offense  when necessary against Israel, which 
has nuclear weapons as well.  What is the reason for the 
IAEA not doing a nuclear arms inspection in Israel?" 
 
 
"Lies and mistakes" 
Zafer Atay wrote in the economic-political Dunya (6/24): 
"Things are becoming a mess for the Bush administration 
because of the way it seems the Hawks have built their Iraq 
policy on lies and mistakes. . It seems very unlikely that 
the American forces in Iraq will be able to find any weapons 
of mass destruction.  All over the indications lead us to 
the fact that the Saddam regime actually destroyed its WMD 
prior to the UN inspection. . The US administration has made 
another mistake by convincing itself that it is seen as the 
savior of Iraq.  And the ongoing instability as well as 
social disorder seems to be creating a very painful period 
for the US administration.  It remains to be seen what other 
consequences will occur after carrying out a policy filled 
with lies and mistakes."
