  ¶1.   Under headline "First duty of army, police is to the 
      nation" the independent daily "The Daily News" dedicated 
      its May 30 editorial to urging Zimbabwe's uniformed forces 
      not to use strong-arm tactics against demonstrators who may 
      participate in next week's possible anti-government 
      protests.  Zimbabwe's main opposition party, the Movement 
      for Democratic Change (MDC), has called for a week-long 
      series of marches and protests aimed at forcing Robert 
      Mugabe to step down.  These protests are slated to begin on 
      June 2.  Editorial excerpts follow: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .The first duty of members of the army and the 
      police, whatever their orders, is to the people of 
      Zimbabwe, regardless of their political affiliations.  They 
      cannot and must not side with tyranny.  History will not 
      look kindly on those State security agents who lose sight 
      of this fact."
