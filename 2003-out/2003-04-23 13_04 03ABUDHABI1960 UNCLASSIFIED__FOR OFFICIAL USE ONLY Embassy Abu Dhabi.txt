¶1. (SBU) Summary:  A yearlong study of the UAE's fish 
and marine resources conducted by Bruce Shallard and 
Associates of New Zealand for the Environmental 
Research and Wildlife Development Agency (ERWDA), 
found commercial and non-commercial fish stocks 
significantly depleted since the last survey was 
conducted 25 years ago. UAE fish stocks are part of a 
larger stock inhabiting the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf 
of Oman and any resource management of these stocks 
will require meaningful cooperation and coordination 
at both the national and regional level, something 
which currently is not in evidence. End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Director of Environmental Education and 
Awareness Division of ERWDA, Dr. Ahmed Bashir, gave 
Econoff a copy of the fish resource assessment survey 
recently conducted by Bruce Shallard and Associates. 
The study was conducted from February 2002 to January 
2003 to assess fish and marine resources in the UAE's 
Exclusive Economic Zone. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The project was the first broad, systematic 
study of the marine resources of the UAE and the first 
survey of UAE fish stocks since 1978.  The report 
recorded current densities for commercial and non- 
commercial fish at only 19% of 1978 estimates in the 
Persian Gulf and only 7% in the east coast -- 
catastrophic declines.  Given that both commercial and 
non-commercial stocks have declined significantly in 
the last 25 years, the decreases cannot be explained 
by overfishing alone and are more likely due to 
environmental changes and habitat degradation. 
Coastline modifications in the UAE including 
activities such as dredging, land reclamation and 
channeling of the seabed have paralleled major 
declines of fish stocks. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The study observes that all major commercial 
species are being exploited at their maximum 
potentials.  Sustainable yields per year of the key 
species were estimated to be 13,000 tons for the 
Persian Gulf and 2000 tons for the east coast, but no 
accurate data is currently available on actual 
harvesting.  Since fish are migratory creatures, UAE 
stocks are part of a larger pool inhabiting the 
Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.  Thus any 
meaningful resource management of fish stocks cannot 
occur in isolation by each emirate but requires 
extensive cooperation and coordination at both the 
national and regional level. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Though UAE Law #24 regulates 
fishing, implementation is sporadic at best.  Recent 
efforts by the authorities to regulate the industry 
include the requirement of special netting that 
permits young fish to escape and seasonal prohibitions 
during fish reproduction periods. Yet, as the study 
notes, over fishing still remains a significant 
problem. More importantly, however, neither the UAE 
nor any of the gulf countries is likely to deal with 
the larger environmental issues that result in 
depletion of fish stocks in the near future. 
Essentially there is a lack of awareness of the issue 
-- example one being that this project was the first 
comprehensive marine study ever done by the UAE and 
the first survey of fish stocks in 25 years.  It also 
must be noted that destruction of the ecosystem 
clearly has played a major role in stock depletion not 
just in the UAE, but across the region.  The UAE in 
particular pays lip-service to being strongly eco- 
friendly, but follow through, particularly when 
projects -- and profits -- are on the line, is spotty 
at best.  End comment.
