SUBJECT:  SME LOR SUBMISSION FOR 30 MM BUSHMASTER CANNONS 
 
REF:  GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA LETTER OF REQUEST DATE 14 
 
MARCH 2003 
 
SUBJECT SME LOR SUBMISSION FOR 30MM BUSHMASTER CANNONS 
 
¶1. THE GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA HAS SUBMITTED REFERENCE 
(FORWARDED UNDER SEPARATE COVER) REQUEST FOR A SYSTEM SALE 
LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE FOR TEN 30MM AUTOMATIC "BUSHMASTER" 
CANNONS WITH ASSOCIATED MOUNTING, FIRE CONTROL, TRAINING, 
SPARES AND AMMUNITION. 
 
¶2. AMEMBASSY COLOMBO STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS SALE AND IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 70003 OF THE SAMM, THE FOLLOWING 
INFORMATION IS SUBMITTED: 
 
¶A.  SRI LANKA REQUIRES THE BUSHMASTER CANNONS TO UPGRADE ITS 
NAVY FAST ATTACK AND COASTAL PATROL CRAFT.  SRI LANKA NAVY 
SHIPS OPERATING IN COASTAL WATERS ARE CURRENTLY OUTGUNNED BY 
THE LTTE.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SINGLE ANCIENT 40MM 
CANNON ON THE NAVY'S INDIAN-MADE OFFSHORE PATROL VESSEL, 
DECK GUNS ARE ALL 20-23MM.   A US-DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
ASSESSMENT OF THE SRI LANKAN MILITARY IN SEPTEMEBR 2002 
REPORTED THE WEAKNESS OF MARITIME SURVEILLANCE AND 
INTERDICTION CAPABILITY TO BE THE CENTER OF GRAVITY IN THE 
WAR AGAINST THE LTTE.  A LARGER CALIBER DECK GUN FOR THE 
NAVY WAS THE ONLY LETHAL SYSTEM MENTIONED IN NEARLY FIVE 
HUNDRED PAGES OF THE DOD ASSESSMENTS.  BUSHMASTER CANNONS 
WOULD GIVE THE NAVY A GREATER CAPABILITY TO FIGHT THE 
FASTER, MORE HEAVILY GUNNED LTTE BOATS, AND PROVIDE 
ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE TO THE LTTE TO MOVE TOWARDS PEACE AND 
AWAY FROM CONFLICT. 
 
¶B.  SIMILAR THOUGH SMALLER CALIBER WEAPONS ARE ALREADY IN 
THE NAVY'S INVENTORY, SO THERE SHOULD BE NO ALTERATION TO 
FORCE STRUCTURE.  THE INCREASE IN RANGE, LETHALITY AND 
ACCURACY HOWEVER, SHOULD GREATLY ENHANCE SRI LANKA'S 
CAPABILITY TO DEFEND ITS COASTAL WATERS AGAINST THE LTTE SEA 
TIGERS. 
 
¶C.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT SRI LANKA'S NEIGHBORS WILL HAVE 
NO SIGNIFICANT OR NEGATIVE REACTION TO THIS SALE.  INDIA HAS 
ASSISTED SRI LANKA AGAINST THE LTTE IN A NUMBER OF WAYS, NOT 
THE LEAST OF WHICH HAS BEEN MARITIME INTERDICTION.  THE 
INTRODUCTION OF A NAVAL WEAPON SYSTEM THAT MIGHT REDUCE 
INDIA'S ASSISTANCE REQUIREMENTS WOULD LIKELY BE VIEWED 
POSITIVELY IN NEW DELHI. 
 
¶D.  WITH PROPER TRAINING, SAILORS IN THE SRI LANKA NAVY 
SHOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE 
BUSHMASTERS, AT LEAST UP TO AND INCLUDING INTERMEDIATE 
LEVEL.  TRAINING AND SPARES ARE EXPECTED IN THE INITIAL 
PURCHASE, SO THE NAVY WILL LIKELY TRAIN DEDICATED PERSONNEL 
TO FOCUS ON BUSHMASTER SYSTEMS MAINTENANCE. 
 
¶E.  THIS SALE SHOULD BE FINANCED WITH COUNTRY FUNDS.  THIS 
PROCUREMENT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL DEFENSE 
PROCUREMENT BUDGET FOR 2003, BUT SENIOR OFFICIALS HAVE 
VERIFIED THAT FUNDING WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE.  SINCE THE 
PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER OF DEFENSE HAVE DESIGNATED THIS 
PROCUREMENT A PRIORITY, SUFFICIENT FUNDS SHOULD BE EARMARKED 
FOR THE PURCHASE WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIME.  THE OVERALL 
ECONOMIC IMPACT TO THE SRI LANKAN ECONOMY IS INSIGNIFICANT. 
 
¶F.  ALTHOUGH HUMAN RIGHTS CONSIDERATIONS CONTINUE TO BE A 
PRIORITY WITH AMEMBASSY COLOMBO, THE GENERAL LEVEL OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS GUARANTEES IS GOOD AND IMPROVING CONTINUOUSLY IN SRI 
LANKA.  THIS CONSDIERATION SHOULD NOT AFFECT THE PROPOSED 
SALE. 
 
¶G. AMEMBASSY COLOMB0 STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THE APPROVAL OF 
THIS PROPOSED SALE. 
 
¶3. POC FOR THIS ACTION IS LTC RICHARD S. GIRVEN, ARMY AND 
DEFENSE ATTACHE, USDAO COLOMBO.
