TAGS: AORC PHUM PREL CA UNGA
SUBJECT: CANADA INTERESTED IN U.S. INITIATIVES FOR UNGA 58 
 
REF: STATE 175664 
 
Classified By: Political MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1.(C)  Post delivered points contained reftel to Peter 
Taylor, Deputy Director of DFAIT's UN and Commonwealth 
Affairs Division and Claude Bibeau, Coordinator for UNGA in 
that division, on June 24, 2003.  Taylor indicated an initial 
interest in each of the five areas enumerated in reftel, 
particularly the women and political participation issue.  He 
stated, however, that Canada's interest in women's issues 
extended beyond political participation into other arenas as 
well. Taylor also said that he wanted to run the initiatives 
past DFAIT's relevant functional bureaus before commenting 
too extensively.  He promised to get back shortly with more 
comments after conferring with his colleagues. 
 
2.(C)  Taylor indicated that Canada had not yet identified 
its top priorities for  UNGA 58.  In addition, Taylor 
admitted that Canada is unlikely to compile a cohesive list 
of objectives having never done so previously.  He agreed, 
however, to pass on pertinent information when it becomes 
available.
