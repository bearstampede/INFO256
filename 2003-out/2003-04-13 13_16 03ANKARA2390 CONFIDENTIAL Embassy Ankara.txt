d. 
 
 
(C) In response to reftel A, we asked Feza Ozturk, head of 
the MFA International Political Organizations Department, 
whether the EU has approached the GOT on the issue of signing 
an Article 98 agreement with the USG.  Ozturk said the EU has 
not raised the issue with the GOT since August 2002, when 
EU-candidate Romania's decision to sign an Article 98 
agreement led to EU demarches to the GOT and other 
governments around the world.  He said the GOT is not facing 
outside pressure to delay an agreement, and repeated reftel B 
arguments that higher-level MFA officials believe the GOT 
should delay an agreement due to the conflict in Iraq.
