  ¶1.   Under headline "DRC rebel ministers irresponsible" the 
      pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated its 
      July 20 editorial to urging leaders from the Democratic 
      Republic of Congo's (DRC) two main rebel movements "to act 
      responsibly and in the interests of their long-suffering 
      people."  The editorial comes immediately after the cabinet 
      ministers had boycotted a swearing-in ceremony last Friday 
      in protest against President Joseph Kabila's appointment as 
      head of the transitional government.  Excerpts follow: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .As we see it, the argument by the rebel 
      ministers lacks merit and serves to complicate an already 
      precarious peace deal that presents the best possible 
      chance of achieving peace in the war-torn central African 
      country.  It profits little for the rebel ministers to 
      insist on academic arguments that serve as a stumbling 
      block to the realization of peace in their country. 
      African leaders, as well as the international community, 
      have invested a great deal into assisting the Congolese to 
      map out a viable way forward out of the deplorable 
      situation. . .It is, therefore, naive and 
      retrogressive for any one of the key parties to the 
      Congolese conflict to seek to undo the sterling work 
      achieved.  The sooner the Congolese road map is set 
      in motion, the better. . . ."
