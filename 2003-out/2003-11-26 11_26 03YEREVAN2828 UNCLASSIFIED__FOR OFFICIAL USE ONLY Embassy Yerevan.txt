¶1. (U) Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please treat

¶2. (SBU) In response to reftel demarche request, 
Armenian MFA United Nations Division Chief Artak 
Apitonian told us November 26 that Armenia would 
likely abstain from the December 2 vote on the 
proposed UN Division of Palestine Rights.  He said, 
however, that the GOAM would find it more difficult 
to abstain from the vote on the Committee on the 
Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the 
Palestinian People given current pressure on 
Armenia's Mission in New York from NAM countries to 
offer "at least a symbolic nod" on the issue.  He 
suggested that the GOAM could change its mind in 
favor of the USG position but that decision-making 
authority on this issue resided in Armenia's New 
York mission. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Apitonian said the GOAM would not likely 
support ICJ involvement in the Middle East issues at 
UNGA, especially since Armenia was not a party to 
the Treaty of Rome.  He called the issue of 
credentials "particularly annoying" and indicated 
that the GOAM would support the USG in opposing the 
proposed amendment.
