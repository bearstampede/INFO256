SUBJECT: UAE ROLE IN INFORMAL INTERNATIONAL CONTACT 
GROUP TO RAISE FUNDS FOR IRAQ STABILIZATION, 
HUMANITARIAN RELIEF AND RECONSTRUCTION 
 
REF: STATE 106648 
 
¶1.  (U) Classified by Marcelle M. Wahba, Ambassador, 
reason 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶2.  (C) DCM delivered reftel points April 27 on UAE 
participation in the Informal International Contact 
Group for Iraq to MFA A/USEC for Political Affairs 
Abdullah Rashed al Nuaimi, noting that the UAE's 
regional perspective, its experience with Iraq and its 
port and transportation infrastructure and capable 
business community would add value to the Contact 
Group discussions.  DCM also conveyed the draft agenda 
for the April 29 conference call, the minutes of the 
April 22 call, the discussion points on reconstruction 
and a donors' conference, as well as the call in 
information. 
 
¶3.  (C) A/USEC Al-Nuaimi underscored the UAEG 
commitment to contributing to Contact Group 
discussions, noting that Shaykh Hamdan had chaired a 
ministerial meeting April 26 at which the Cabinet had 
approved participation.  He said that the government 
was still determining who would represent the UAE in 
the Contact Group, but indicated that the UAE would 
need more than one participant because of its federal 
structure and the role that Dubai stood to play in 
Iraq reconstruction.  He suggested Dubai Ports and 
Customs Authority Executive Chairman Sultan bin 
Sulayim as a likely participant.  On April 28, MFA 
MINSTATE Hamdan bin Zayed called the Ambassador to 
confirm that three UAE officials would participate in 
the April 29 teleconference: Abdullah Rashed Al- 
Nuaimi, Finance MINSTATE Dr. Mohamed Khalfan bin 
Khirbash and Sultan bin Sulayim.  The three will 
gather in Dr. Khirbash's office to participate in the 
call.
