SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT PAPER COVERS POWELL-NCUBE MEETING 
 
  ¶1.   The meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Colin 
      Powell and Bulawayo Archbishop Pius Ncube provided the 
      lead story in the May 22 edition of the government- 
      controlled daily "Chronicle."  The article distorted 
      the purpose and substance of the may 20 meeting 
      Washington, DC.  The article accused the United States 
      for exploiting the meeting with Ncube to advance its 
      desire to "overthrow" the government of Robert Mugabe. 
      change of government in Zimbabwe."  Excerpts of Under 
      the headline "U.S. praises Pius Ncube: Archbishop 
      thanked for anti-govt stance," the article says in 
      part: 
 
  ¶2.   "The United States Government has lauded the head 
      of the Roman Catholic Church in Matabeleland, 
      Archbishop Pius Ncube, for assisting it in its bid to 
      effect a change of Government in Zimbabwe.  U.S. 
      Secretary of States Mr. Colin Powell met Archbishop 
      Ncube, a controversial cleric who dabbles in politics, 
      in Washington on Tuesday and `thanked' him for his 
      anti-Government stance. . .  Diplomatic sources said 
      Archbishop Ncube was being rewarded for helping the 
      U.S. and Britain in their quest to topple President 
      Mugabe. . . ."
