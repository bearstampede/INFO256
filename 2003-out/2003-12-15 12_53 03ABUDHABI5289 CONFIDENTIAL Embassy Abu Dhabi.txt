SUBJECT: SADDAM'S CAPTURE - UAEG REACTION 
 
Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, Reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (U) UAE officialdom reacted positively to 
Saddam's capture. In an official statement 
released December 15, UAE President Shaykh Zayed 
expressed the hope that Iraq will witness a new era 
of stability and security in which its national 
unity and territorial integrity will be preserved. 
"Iraq has been relieved of a heavy burden and this 
will enable it to move forward to a new era where 
there will be no despotism, oppression, and fear, 
and none of the practices that destroyed Iraq over 
recent decades, causing serious damage to the whole 
of the Arab and Islamic nations," the statement 
read. 
 
¶2. (U) Zayed continued, "I hope that the recent 
developments in Iraq will contribute to the 
restoration of stability and peace in that country, 
and will prove to be a stepping-stone that will 
permit the Iraqi people to unify their ranks and to 
strengthen their national reconciliation, giving 
priority, above all else, to that which will foster 
the unity of Iraq as a country and as a people, 
working hand-in-hand for a bright future." 
 
¶3. (C) Deputy Prime Minister and de facto Foreign 
Minister Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayed told the 
Ambassador on December 14 that the capture was 
significant and a positive outcome. Capturing 
Saddam alive was better for the Iraqis, he said, 
because they now have a chance to bring him to 
trial. Shaykh Hamdan said he hoped to hear similar 
news about Al Qaida leaders Osama bin Laden and 
Ayman Al-Zawahiri. 
 
¶4. (U) The Emirati press also reacted positively to 
Saddam's capture, with the English daily Gulf News 
describing the event as an opportunity to start 
afresh, to end the phase of armed resistance to the 
coalition, and to move ahead with rebuilding a new 
Iraq based on the will of the people as expressed 
freely and without coercion.
