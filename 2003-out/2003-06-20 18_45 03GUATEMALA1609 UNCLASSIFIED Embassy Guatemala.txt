SUBJECT: COUNTER-NARCOTICS MARITIME AGREEMENT SIGNED 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 171694 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 171678 
 
¶1. (U) Ambassador Hamilton and Foreign Minister Gutierrez 
signed the bilateral counter-narcotics maritime agreement 
(reftels) in a ceremony at the MFA on June 19.  Signature of 
this landmark agreement has been an important element in our 
dialogue with the GOG on counter-narcotics certification. 
The Ambassador told reporters that in signing the agreement, 
Guatemala was taking a significant step forward in the fight 
against drug trafficking and was joining five of its 
neighbors who have similar agreements.  The Foreign Minister 
commented that reaching this agreement had been a priority 
for both governments because narcotics trafficking has grown 
to the point that it threatens national security.  Guatemala, 
he said, needs to intensify its cooperation with it neighbors 
to confront this international menace.  The agreement will 
enter into force once it is ratified by the Guatemalan 
Congress.  The GOG intends to send the agreement to Congress 
for "urgent treatment" in a special session.
