 (C) A senior Dutch official covering Middle East affairs 
responded to reftel demarche by acknowledging that the GONL 
is aware of and concerned about the Palestinian Authority's 
dire financial straits.  The Netherlands, however, will be 
unable to provide any urgent financial assistance.  The 
official indicated that -- faced with pressure from the Dutch 
parliament to reduce contributions to Palestinian Authority 
funding -- the GONL would only consider Palestinian funding 
issues in an EU context and would not take a leadership role 
in pushing for additional funds.
