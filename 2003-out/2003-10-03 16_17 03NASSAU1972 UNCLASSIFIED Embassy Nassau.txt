TAGS: BF SNAR OPBAT
SUBJECT: OPBAT OPERATIVE SEIZED 800 POUNDS OF COCAINE 
 
SUMMARY 
¶1. On October 1, 2003 charges were filed before a Nassau 
Magistrate against eight of the nine individuals arrested on 
September 27 in connection with a seizure of more than 800 
pounds of cocaine.  The seizure was completed by members of 
the Royal Bahamas Police Force in cooperation with the 
members of The Operation Bahamas and Turks and Caicos 
(OPBAT). 
END OF SUMMARY 
 
¶2. Acting on investigative intelligence gathered by the Drug 
Enforcement Unit of the Royal Bahamas Police Force, OPBAT 
helicopters identified an illegal air drop near the island of 
Eleuthera.  Alerted of the whereabouts of the vessel, marine 
units intercepted the vessel and arrested its occupants.  The 
aircraft crew were later arrested at Marsh Harbour on the 
island of Abaco. 
 
¶3. OPBAT is a three nation, interagency drug interdiction 
operation based in Nassau.  The September 27 operative 
resulted in the confiscation of an aircraft, a go-fast vessel 
and more than 840 pounds of cocaine with an estimated street 
value of $12 million. 
 
¶4. This spectacular seizure that attracted headlines by the 
major newspapers in Nassau is exemplary of the effectiveness 
of OPBAT drug eradication efforts in The Bahamas.
