SUBJECT: UAE INTERESTED IN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Nasser Sweidan, office director for de facto 
Finance Minister Dr. Khirbash, called A/DCM June 5 to say 
that he was drafting a letter from MFA Minstate Hamdan bin 
Zayid to Secretaries Powell and Evans outlining the UAEG's 
strong interest in pursuing a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) 
with the United States.  A/DCM thanked Sweidan for the 
heads-up. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Comment:   The UAE leadership is excited about 
the President's South Carolina speech, particularly the 
Middle East Free Trade Agreement concept.  Both de facto 
Defense Minister Shaykh Muhammad bin Zayid and MFA Minstate 
Hamdan bin Zayid have called the Ambassador to say the UAE 
would like to pursue this actively and looks to us for 
guidance on next steps.  Dubai Ports Authority Chairman 
Sultan bin Sulayem was also very positive during recent 
meetings in Washington.  We would appreciate guidance from 
the Department on how we may respond to the UAE's 
enthusiasm (would a TIFA be the first step?), and what the 
potential hurdles might be (national treatment of foreign 
investors, set-asides like agency laws?).  End Comment.
