(U) Classified by Economic Counselor Scot Marciel for reasons 
1.5 (b), (d). 
 
 
¶1.  (S) On February 18 and 21, MFA Department Head for 
Intelligence and Research Nihat Ersen and MFA 
counter-terrorism officer Firat Sunel responded to our 
demarches on four terrorist asset freeze requests (reftels). 
 Two of the four involved pre-notifications of upcoming UN 
designations (Chechen groups and Ansar al-Islam), and we 
stressed the  need to act quickly on both requests. 
 
 
¶2.  (S) Ersen and Sunel said the names on the four demarches 
would be circulated interagency to GOT intelligence agencies, 
Treasury, banking regulatory board and Central Bank to 
research possible financial links to Turkey.  If there were 
any assets under these names in Turkey, they would be blocked 
informally.  However, formal, legal blocking of assets 
required a Council of Ministers decree, and GOT practice was 
to include names on such decrees only after they have been 
designated by the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee.  The MFA 
was now preparing a draft decree and would include on it 
about 20 names recently designated by the UN (including 
Laashkar i Jhangvi). 
 
 
¶3.  (U)  Sunel updated us on the reaction to the last Council 
of Ministers decree, issued in October 2002, which included 
the Nasreddin Holding company in Istanbul.   This company's 
assets had been blocked, and Sunel said he would find out the 
dollar amount involved and inform us.  The MFA had recently 
received a letter from the company's Turkish lawyers 
threatening a lawsuit if the assets were not unblocked.
