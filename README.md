Darrell Vermilion

These are the source and text files for the INFO 256 Final Project of Fall 2013.

The goal of this project is to use NLP techniques to analyze a series of the Wikileaks cables in 
an effort to glean some information that should lead to correlations between word/topic distributions
and specific events in time. 

This directory should contain the following:
-.py files
  -data extractor
  -main algorithm (LDA)
  -any additional algorithms (atomic, i.e. frequency distributions)
-.txt files
  -progress/changelog
  -output files (freq. dist. files, wordcounts, misc. statistics)
  -final writeup
-.zip files
  -corpora majoris--the wikileaks cables
  -"pickled" cables
  -data extracted into text files, zipped for convenience
