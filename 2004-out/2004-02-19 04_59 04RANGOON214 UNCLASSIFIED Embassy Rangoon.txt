SUBJECT: NO BIOTECH REGULATIONS IN BURMA 
 
REF: STATE 16321 
 
¶1. The Burmese government currently has no laws or 
regulations on the books regarding the import of 
biotechnology-derived food products.  The Ministries of 
Agriculture, Forestry, Livestock and Fisheries, and the 
Customs Department are now forming a working committee to 
draw up a framework to address this issue and expect results 
within 18 months. 
 
¶2. We note that while it remains legal to export agricultural 
and other products to Burma, current U.S. policy prohibits 
U.S. government officials from encouraging or discouraging 
these exports.  U.S. law bans assistance to the government of 
Burma, all new U.S. investment in Burma, and all imports of 
Burmese products into the United States.
