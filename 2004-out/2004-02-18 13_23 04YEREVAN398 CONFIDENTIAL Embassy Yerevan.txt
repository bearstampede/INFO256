GOAM WITH US ON CUBA? 
--------------------- 
 
¶1. (C) We discussed UNCHR issues and ways to more effectively 
pursue continuing USG policy priorities at the UN with MFA UN 
Division Chief Artak Apitonian February 11 (reftel). 
Apitonian credited the apparent decline in USG-GOAM voting 
coincidence during the 58th UNGA as a reaction to "more 
aggressive USG multilateral approaches on the Middle East" 
rather than fundamental disagreements on policy.  He 
emphasized the GOAM's previous voting record and 2003 record 
on disarmament issues as indicative of an overall cooperative 
relationship with the USG in Geneva and New York.  He 
predicted that the GOAM would support more USG initiatives 
during 2004 through fewer absention votes and possible 
co-sponsorship of key resolutions.  He hinted that the GOAM 
might be able to support the USG on this year's Cuba 
resolution if approached with enough advance notice.

EARLIER DEMARCHES USEFUL 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. (C) Apitonian said there was broad agreement among GOAM 
representatives in Yerevan and New York that the proposed 
Democracy Caucus would offer a "less politicized" forum in 
which the GOAM could openly support USG-proposed measures 
without the fear of pressure or backlash from the Non-Aligned 
States (NAS).  He suggested, however, that the USG could 
better engage the GOAM on CHR issues this year if it would 
demarche the MFA, in addition to representatives in Geneva, 
earlier in the process.  He claimed that the FM and Deputy 
Ministers had been increasingly active on multilateral issues 
over the past year and predicted a relative decline in the 
importance of the GOAM's missions in Geneva and New York as 
this trend continues.

COMMENT

¶3. (C) The MFA's heightened interest in multilateral 
mechanics is due in part to Armenia's current candidature for 
re-election to the CHR, which the GOAM views as its highest 
profile ambition on the multilateral scene.  The MFA's 
multilateral department is at long last fully staffed and 
generally responsive to Embassy requests.  Engaging early and 
often with the MFA will no doubt help counterbalance voting 
pressure from the NAS and European countries.  Post requests 
Department assistance in identifying which issues it can 
preview with the GOAM to lay the groundwork for better CHR 
and UNGA cooperation this year.
