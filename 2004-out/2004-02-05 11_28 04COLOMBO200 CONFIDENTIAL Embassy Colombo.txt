MCA Questions 
------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) We noted with great interest the press guidance 
from the Department on the Millenium Challenge Corporation 
and timeline for implementing the Millenium Challenge 
Account.  Knowing that Sri Lanka figures high on the 
notional list of recipients, however, gives us pause when we 
think about the timeframe and the funding levels that have 
been discussed.  Is there any guidance either ready, or 
being prepared, on when proposals and justifications will 
need to be sent and how the funding mechanism will work? 
While we know the MCC is just getting set up, we thought 
some basics might have been worked up ahead of time. 
Appreciate any thoughts you can send our way.  (ECON) 
 
READOUT FROM ROCCA - PEIRIS MEETING 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) Just want to check how the A/S Rocca-Harim 
Peiris meeting went.  Any readout?   We saw Tokyo's 
readout of the D/Akashi meeting.  By the way, has the 
agenda for the February 17 meeting been settled on and 
can we see it?  (As usual, we want to thank the Desk for 
assiduously keeping us in the loop by sending us 
documents related to A/S Rocca's meetings with the GoI 
and with Peiris to review.)  (POL) 
 
RE A.Q. KHAN 
------------ 
 
¶3.  (C) We know the information is just emerging, but 
wanted to ask you about press play mentioning some sort 
of vague Sri Lanka nexus (among many other vague 
connections) to the A.Q. Khan matter.  The New York 
Times and Washington Post have had articles briefly 
mentioning such a connection, including one that 
mentions a mysterious Sri Lankan national named "Tahir" 
who is reportedly in custody in Malaysia.  Is there any 
info you can share?  (POL) 
 
A MORE MILITARIZED NATIONAL DAY PARADE 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) FYI.  The Ambassador attended yesterday's 
National Day ceremony.  As you will see in our front- 
channel today, the President's address on the occasion 
was less combative than usual.  The parade itself, 
however, was much more militarized.  Most every unit in 
the military was reportedly represented and there were 
tanks, APC's and even multi-barreled rocket launchers. 
The "heavy with weapons" aspect of the parade was 
probably not meant as a menacing message to the LTTE (we 
doubt the group would have been frightened, in any 
case).  Rather, it probably represented more a feeling 
on the part of the military that the peace process is 
far enough along that it can bring some of its weapons 
back from the north and east to Colombo (at least 
temporarily).  In the meantime, the LTTE held its 
regular "black flag" ceremonies throughout the north and 
east to protest national day.  (POL/DAO)
