Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: The Ambassador met with Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs 
Shaykh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al Nahyan (HBZ) on February 24 
and discussed the recent visit of G/TIP Coordinator 
Mark Taylor to the UAE.  HBZ said combatting 
trafficking in women is a priority for the UAEG and he 
pledged his cooperation with the USG.  The meeting 
included an exchange on developments in the Abdul 
Qadeer Khan case that will be treated septel.  The 
Ambassador and HBZ also discussed final preparations 
for the March 2 Strategic Partnership and NEC 
dedication ceremony.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (C) During a meeting with HBZ on February 24, the 
Ambassador provided a summary of G/TIP Coordinator 
Mark Taylor's recent visit to the UAE.  The Ambassador 
said that the meetings with UAE officials were 
excellent and the discussion was open.  With respect 
to the ban on underage and underweight camel jockeys, 
the Ambassador said that it was apparent that there is 
a serious effort to implement UAE regulations and 
there had been good cooperation from authorities of 
source countries. 
 
¶3. (C) With regard to the trafficking in women issue, 
the Ambassador said that there were some differences 
in defining the problem and the discussions with law 
enforcement officials provided the opportunity for our 
delegation to clarify some of these issues.  We hope 
to see more active involvement from the UAE law 
enforcement agencies in investigating and prosecuting 
the traffickers.  HBZ took this on board and said that 
combatting trafficking in women was the UAEG's 
priority as well because it is detrimental to our 
society and reputation.  He encouraged more visitors 
from the U.S., as well as more training opportunities 
and greater law enforcement cooperation to tackle the 
problem. 
 
¶5. (U) The Ambassador and HBZ briefly reviewed plans 
for the March 2 Strategic Partnership meeting, which 
HBZ's brother Abdullah, the Information and Culture 
Minister, would lead on the UAE side, and they 
previewed the NEC dedication ceremony.
