SUBJECT: CROATIA REQUEST UNDER AMBASSADORS' FUND FOR 
 
REFUGEES 
 
REF: STATE 7199 
 
IN FY 03 POST IDENTIFIED SOME CRITICAL GAPS IN FUNDING FOR 
REFUGEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AND PRM RESPONDED WITH FUNDING 
FOR MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES FOR A HOSPITAL IN KNIN, 
AND SUPPORT FOR A COMMUNITY CENTER SERVING AN ETHNICALLY 
MIXED COMMUNITY.  WE HAVE CONSULTED WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, NGOS, AND IN THE GOVERNMENT AND 
    HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME ADDITIONAL CRITICAL GAPS IN FY 04 THAT 
COULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE AMBASSADORS' FUND FOR 
REFUGEES.  WE REQUEST THAT PRM MAKE AVAILABLE TO POST $20,000 
IN FY 04 FUNDING FOR THE FOLLOWING PRIORITY PROJECTS: 
 
DVOR KINDERGARTEN: $5,000 FOR REBUILDING OF THE HEATING 
SYSTEM.  THE KINDERGARTEN WAS RECONSTRUCTED FOLLOWING THE WAR 
THROUGH FINANCING PROVIDED BY USAID, ASB (GERMAN SUPPORTED), 
AND THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, SUBSEQUENT TO THE 
RECONSTRUCTION, THE HEATING SYSTEM HAS BEGUN TO FAIL AND MUST 
BE REPLACED.  THE PREVIOUS DONORS CANNOT ADDRESS THIS NEED 
DUE TO FUNDING GAPS. 
 
VUKOVAR SECONDARY SCHOOL: $5,000 FOR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND 
SPORTS EQUIPMENT.  THE SCHOOL HAS A MIXED STUDENT BODY OF 
ETHNIC CROATS AND SERBS, INCLUDING BOTH RETURNED REFUGEES AND 
IDPS.  HOWEVER, RESOURCES AVAILABLE HAVE PROVEN WHOLLY 
INADEQUATE FOR STUDENTS RECREATIONAL NEEDS, AS WELL AS ACCESS 
TO THE INTERNET AND THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT WOULD 
PROVIDE.  GOVERNMENTAL SOURCES AND OTHER DONORS ARE UNABLE TO 
MEET THIS FUNDING NEED. 
 
LIPOVACA PRIMARY SCHOOL EXTENSION: $5,000 FOR FURNISHINGS AND 
A COMPUTER SYSTEM.  THE SCHOOL, WHICH SERVES GRADES 1-4 IN AN 
ETHNICALLY MIXED AREA OF FORMER REFUGEES AND IDPS IN EASTERN 
SLAVONIA, WAS RECONSTRUCTED FOLLOWING THE WAR BY THE MINISTRY 
OF EDUCATION.  HOWEVER, NO FUNDING HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR 
FURNISHINGS, WHICH ARE SORELY LACKING. 
 
UDBINA CLINIC: $5,000 FOR MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND FURNISHINGS. 
THE CLINIC WAS RECENTLY RECONSTRUCTED THROUGH FINANCING 
    PROVIDED BY THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT.  THE RECONSTRUCTION 
FINANCING WAS INSUFFICIENT TO EQUIP AND FURNISH THE CLINIC, 
WHICH SERVES A LARGE RURAL WAR-AFFECTED AREA IN WHICH MANY 
RETURNEES LIVE AND HAVE LITTLE ACCESS TO OTHER HEALTH CARE 
PROVIDERS. 
 
POST WILL IMPLEMENT AND MANAGE PROJECT FUNDS, AND ENSURE 
APPROPRIATE MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT 
POSSIBLE, POST WILL ARRANGE FOR PRESS OR PUBLIC ATTENTION TO 
OUR CONTRIBUTIONS, AND USE THE OCCASION TO HIGHLIGHT OUR 
SUPPORT FOR REFUGEE RETURN AND REINTEGRATION IN CROATIA.
