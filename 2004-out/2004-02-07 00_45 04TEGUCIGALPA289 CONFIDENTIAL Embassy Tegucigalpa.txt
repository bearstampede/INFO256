¶1. (C)  SUMMARY:  The policy statements and standard 
operating procedures outlined below are keyed to questions 
posed in ref D and based on discussion with the joint 
State/DOD team that visited Honduras on February 2-4.  Post 
wishes to underscore that U.S. information sharing with 
Honduras has proven to be a critical element in the enormous 
increase in Honduras interdiction efforts. In 2003, Honduras 
seized over 5,700 kilos of cocaine and 13 kilos of heroin, 
representing more than all combined cocaine/heroin seizures 
during the previous five years.  During the first month of 
2004, Honduras seized 1,128 kilos of cocaine and 13 kilos of 
heroin, putting the country on track to exceed last year's 
record seizures.  Any interruption in U.S. information 
sharing would most certainly result in significantly reduced 
Honduran interdiction capabilities.  In addition, there are 
important bilateral military-to-military interests that could 
be put at risk, including continued Honduran willingness to 
support U.S. initiatives to promote increased regional 
military cooperation by hosting combined exercises with other 
Central American countries and, even, to extend the Honduran 
troop deployment in Iraq for a second year.  Honduras has 
been a strong supporter of U.S. foreign policy goals in the 
UN, Summit of the Americas, and CAFTA negotiations. Post 
recommends that Washington policymakers adopt a uniform 
approach to information sharing with all countries in the 
region.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
WRITTEN ASSURANCE OF NO SHOOT-DOWN POLICY 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C)  As reported in ref D, post received written assurance 
from General Jose Isaias Barahona, the Chief of the Joint 
Staff of the Armed Forces, that Honduras does not have a 
policy of shooting down civil aircraft.  The Government of 
Honduras does reserve the right to defend itself from any 
threat from any unlawful civil air flight linked to 
international terrorism. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES FOR AIR INTERCEPTION/USE OF 
WARNING SHOTS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶3. (C)  During its visit, the INL/DOD team only partially 
received requested documentation.  The Honduran Air Force 
(HAF) did not provide copies of the HAF standard operating 
procedures (SOPs) for air interception and firing of warning 
shots.  The HAF Commander, Col Manuel Enrique Caceres Diaz, 
maintained that such air order of battle documents are 
classified.  They referred the team to General Barahona's 
January 26 letter as illustrative of the SOPs used by the 
HAF.  However, HAF officials did provide ICAO procedures that 
they use to intercept unidentified aircraft. (COMMENT: 
Mission elements question whether HAF has comprehensive, 
fully articulated, and widely distributed SOPs. END COMMENT.) 
 
--------------- 
INCIDENT REPORT 
--------------- 
 
¶4. (C)  HAF Commander faxed copies of this report on January 
¶26.  Mission is seeking original copies. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
CIRCUMSTANCES FOR FIRING WARNING SHOTS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (C)  HAF Commander told the INL/DOD team that the air 
defense crews only consider, in consultation with the HAF 
operations center, the option of firing warning shots after 
completing all of the required ICAO signals and procedures. 
Such warning shots are then only fired from along side of 
(parallel to) the intruding aircraft.  They execute such 
warning shots without putting at risk either the life or 
safety of the occupants of the intruding aircraft.  They also 
avoid shooting over populated areas in order to protect the 
safety of people on the ground. 
 
-------------------------------- 
REASONS FOR FIRING WARNING SHOTS 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (C)  The goal of warning shots is to establish 
communication with the flight crew of the intruding aircraft 
after all other ICAO methods have been exhausted.  According 
to the HAF Commander, the HAF interceptors must be able to 
communicate with intruding aircraft in order to identify 
positively the aircraft and to give them directions for 
landing their aircraft at a Honduran air field. 
 
---------------------------------- 
AUTHORITY FOR FIRING WARNING SHOTS 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (C)  The air defense pilots must seek authorization for 
firing warning shots from the Commander of the Air Force, who 
in turn is authorized to issue such an order only by the 
Chief of the Joint Staff of the Armed Forces. Each and every 
individual volley of warning shots must be authorized through 
this chain of command. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
CIRCUMSTANCES FOR SHOOTING DOWN CIVIL AIRCRAFT 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶8. (C)  According to the HAF Commander, only the President of 
Honduras can give the order to shoot down a civil aircraft, 
which would only be undertaken if the aircraft posed a threat 
of terrorism to the civilian population. 
 
------------------------------- 
PUBLIC NOTICE TO CIVIL AVIATION 
------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (C)  The Government of Honduras does not provide any 
notice to airmen of its air intercept guidelines and expects 
all airmen to follow ICAO procedures.
