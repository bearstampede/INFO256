) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (C ON FEBRUARY 18, CARMEN ALGUINDIGUE, DIRECTOR OF 
PROCEDURAL ACTION AND ONE OF THREE KEY CAREER EMPLOEES IN 
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, WAS FIRED. ACCORDING TO 
LEGATT, AT LEAST TWO MORE TOP EMPLYEES IN THE ORGANIZATION

CHAVEZ.

GENERAL ISAIAS RODRIGUEZ ANNOUNCED A SHIT IN POLICY TO 
MANIPULATE CASE INVESTIGATIONS TOFAVOR GOV INTERESTS.  ANY 
CASES BROUGHT AGAINST HE CHAVEZ GOVERNMENT WOULD BE HANDLED 
IN SUCH A MNNER THAT THE OUTCOMES WOULD NOT EMBARRASS OR 
DAAGE THE GOV.  SEVERAL SENIOR OFFICIALS, INCLUDING 
ALGUINDIGUE, OBJECTED TO WHAT THEY VIEWED AS A POICY OF 
POLITICAL FAVORITISM AND WERE CONSEQUENTL INFORMED THEY 
WOULD BE REPLACED BY CHAVEZ SUPPORERS BY MARCH 1.  AMONG 
THOSE WHO EXPECT TO BE FIED ARE RAMON MEDINA, DIRECTOR OF 
CRIMINAL PROSECTIONS, AND MAGALY MALPICA, CHIEF OF THE 
DIRECTORTE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.  MEDINA OVERSEES 70 
PECENT OF THE COUNTRY'S PUBLIC PROSECUTORS.  MALPICA S IN 
CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING PUBLIC OFFICIALS ACUSED OF ABUSE OF

    COMMENT

¶3. (C) BY REMOVING THESE OFFICIALS, TH CHAVEZ GOVERNMENT IS 
DISMANTLING THE LAST BULWAK OF INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY IN 
THE ATTORNEY GENRAL'S OFFICE.  ALTHOUGH LEGATT EXPECTS 
CONTINUIN COOPERATION FROM VENEZUELAN LAW ENFORCEMENT ON 
TRICTLY CRIMINAL MATTERS, COOPERATION IN POLITICALL 
SENSITIVE CASES WILL LIKELY BE MINIMAL AT BEST. IN ADDITION, 
LEGATT IS PESSIMISTIC REGARDING TH EMBASSY'S FUTURE ABILITY 
TO INFLUENCE INSTITUTINAL REFORM IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S 
OFFICE, ESPCIALLY THROUGH US-BASED TRAINING PROGRAMS.
