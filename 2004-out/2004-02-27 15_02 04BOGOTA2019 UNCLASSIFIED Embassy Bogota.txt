¶1. Reftel A provided Embassy Bogota's comments regarding 
Colombia's compliance with the Hague Convention on 
International Child Abduction.  Ref e-mail B communicated 
that the Office of Children's Issues has decided to 
identify Colombia as a country not in compliance with the 
convention in the upcoming report to Congress, which will 
cover the year 2003. 
 
¶2. Embassy Bogota greatly appreciates the Department's 
consideration of the information submitted in reftel A. 
The Embassy requests that, to the extent possible, the 
report to Congress include mention of the commitments the 
GoC has made in 2004 to improve Colombia's compliance with 
the convention.  In particular, we wish to call attention 
to the Ministry of Foreign Relation's commitment to make 
implementing legislation a matter of urgency and to 
expedite pending cases, as reported in reftel A, para. 10. 
 
¶3. Embassy Bogota will continue working with the GoC to 
ensure these commitments are honored, and on any other 
steps that will lead to improved compliance.
