SUBJECT: BAHRAINI MFA WITH US ON IRAQ RESOLUTION AT UNCHR 
 
REF: A. MANAMA 217 
 
     ¶B. STATE 32070 
 
Classified By: CDA Robert Ford, reason 1.4 b and d. 
 
¶1.  (C)  BAHRAINI MFA DIRECTOR FOR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION 
AFFAIRS TOLD POL/ECON CHIEF ON FEBRUARY 17 THAT BAHRAIN AND 
SEVERAL OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES ARE NOT INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING 
THE ALGERIAN RESOLUTION ABOUT IRAQ BEFORE THE UNCHR.  (HE 
CITED KUWAIT AS ANOTHER ARAB COUNTRY TAKING THIS STANCE.) 
ACCORDING TO OUR MFA SOURCE, THE BAHRAINI PERMREP IN GENEVA 
IS UNSURE WHETHER THE ALGERIAN IS ACTING UNDER DIRECT 
INSTRUCTIONS FROM ALGIERS OR IS INSTEAD ACTING ON HIS OWN IN 
PUTTING FORWARD THIS RESOLUTION.  OUR MFA SOURCE SUGGESTED 
THAT ARAB COUNTRIES WILL LET THE RESOLUTION DIE ITS OWN QUIET 
DEATH, AND IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE U.S. NOT TO RAISE ITS 
PROFILE DURING THAT PROCESS. THE MFA OFFICIAL SPECULATED THAT 
THE ALGERIAN PERMREP MIGHT HAVE CONFERRED WITH EUROPEAN 
REPRESENTATIVES BEFORE PUTTING THE RESOLUTION FORWARD, BUT 
THE BAHRAINI MFA HAS NO INFORMATION. 
 
¶2. (C)  THE MFA SOURCE REPORTED THAT THE BAHRAINI PERMREP 
ALSO HAS TOLD MANAMA THAT THE IRAQI DELEGATION IN GENEVA HAS 
REMAINED AMBIGUOUS ABOUT THE ALGERIAN RESOLUTION.  ACCORDING 
TO THE BAHRAINIS, THE IRAQIS ARE TELLING THE ARAB DELEGATIONS 
IN GENEVA THAT THE IRAQIS DO NOT OBJECT TO RENEWING THE 
MANDATE OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR TO COVER THE SADDAM REGIME 
AND THE POST-APRIL 9 GOVERNMENT.  THE BAHRAINI MFA SOURCE 
ADDED THAT THE BAHRAINI PERMREP IS REPORTING TO MANAMA THAT 
THE IRAQI DELEGATION IN GENEVA SEES NO NEED FOR A SPECIAL 
RAPPORTEUR TO INVESTIGATE CRIMES FROM THE SADDAM ERA BECAUSE 
THE SADDAM REGIME IS GONE AND THE NEW IRAQI GOVERNMENT CAN 
HANDLE THE INVESTIGATIONS ON ITS OWN.
