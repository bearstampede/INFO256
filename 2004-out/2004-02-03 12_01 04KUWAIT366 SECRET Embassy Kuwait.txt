SUBJECT: (S) HOMELAND SECURITY WORKING GROUP

¶1.  (S) Charge chaired Post's monthly Homeland Security 
Working Group (HSWG) meeting January 26.  (Visas Viper 
meeting reported septel.)  The group agreed that the Embassy 
is taking all appropriate security measures. 
 
¶2.  (S) Embassy has facilitated a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU) between the GOK and US military forces in Kuwait, 
represented by Coalition Forces Land Component Command 
(CFLCC), regarding procedures at the land border crossings 
between Kuwait and Iraq.  This MOU, which is undergoing final 
review by the GOK after having been cleared within the US 
military, will enable more thorough coverage by Customs and 
Immigration of the massive volume of convoy traffic to and 
from Iraq associated with US forces and CPA.  The US military 
has already invested several million dollars to upgrade these 
border crossings, in advance of MOU signature.  This close 
coordination between the US military and the host nation 
should greatly reduce the threat of smuggling, including of 
terrorists and weapons/explosives. 
 
¶3.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered.
