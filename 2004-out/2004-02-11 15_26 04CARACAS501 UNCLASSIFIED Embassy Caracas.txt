SUBJECT:  UPDATE ON THE USAID/OTI VENEZUELA PROGRAM 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  USAID'S OFFICE OF TRANSITION INITIATIVES (OTI) BEGAN ITS 
VENEZUELA PROGRAM IN NOVEMBER 2002 TO SUPPORT THE PRIMARY 
USG GOAL OF SUPPORTING DEMOCRACY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLUTIONS TO 
VENEZUELA'S POLITICAL CRISIS.  USAID'S OVERALL GOAL IN 
VENEZUELA IS TO SUPPORT A POLITICAL PROCESS THAT IS 
    DEMOCRATIC, CONSTITUTIONAL, ELECTORAL AND PEACEFUL. 
SPECIFICALLY THE PROGRAM FOCUSES ON: SUPPORT TO ELECTORAL 
PROCESSES, SUPPORT OF A FAVORABLE ELECTORAL ENVIRONMENT, 
FACILITATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIALOGUE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT 
AND OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS, AND PUBLIC CIVIC EDUCATION. TO 
SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM, USAID IS FUNDING THE FOLLOWING PARTNER 
ORGANIZATIONS:  THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE FOR 
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, THE INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN 
INSTITUTE, THE CARTER CENTER, DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVES, 
INC., AND A LARGE NUMBER OF VENEZUELAN CIVIL SOCIETY 
ORGANIZATIONS. THE PROGRAM IS SCHEDULED TO RUN THROUGH EARLY 
FY 2005.  END SUMMARY. 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
¶2. POST HAS WITNESSED ENCOURAGING MOVEMENT TOWARDS A 
PEACEFUL OUTCOME OF VENEZUELA'S CURRENT POLITICAL CRISIS. 
ONE YEAR AGO THE COUNTRY WAS SHUT DOWN BY A NATIONAL STRIKE 
WHOSE GOAL WAS TO FORCE THE RESIGNATION OF PRESIDENT CHAVEZ. 
THE OPPOSITION HAS SINCE CHOSEN A PATH FOR POLITICAL CHANGE 
BASED ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF CITIZENS TO RECALL 
ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICIALS HALF WAY THROUGH THEIR TERMS OF 
OFFICE.  THIS CHANGE OF STRATEGY RESULTED IN TWO RECENT 
SIGNATURE-GATHERING EXERCISES:  NOVEMBER 21 - 24 TO RECALL 
37 OPPOSITION MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY; AND NOVEMBER 
28 TO DECEMBER 1 TO RECALL PRESIDENT CHAVEZ AND 30 PRO- 
GOVERNMENT LEGISLATORS.  THE TWO EVENTS WERE CARRIED OUT IN 
A PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE AND WERE SUBSEQUENTLY DECLARED 
FUNDAMENTALLY FREE OF FRAUD BY THE CARTER CENTER AND THE 
ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES.  THE OPPOSITION ANNOUNCED 
THAT IT HAD COLLECTED 3.6 MILLION SIGNATURES DURING THE 
    SIGNATURE DRIVE TO PETITION FOR A RECALL REFERENDUM AGAINST 
PRESIDENT CHAVEZ, SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THE 2.4 MILLION 
NEEDED. 
¶3. IF THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL FINDS THAT THE 
OPPOSITION HAS MET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CALLING A REFERENDUM 
AGAINST PRESIDENT CHAVEZ, AND THE REFERENDUM IS SUCCESSFUL, 
THIS WOULD BE FOLLOWED A MONTH LATER (POSSIBLY SOMETIME IN 
JUNE) BY A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION - FOLLOWED BY ELECTIONS FOR 
GOVERNORS AND MAYORS IN LATE JULY.  IN DECEMBER 2006, THERE 
WILL BE ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND AN ELECTION FOR 
ALL NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MEMBERS.  IF THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT 
IS ANY GAUGE, ALL OF THESE ELECTORAL EVENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE 
CARRIED OUT IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF MUTUAL DISTRUST AND 
ACCUSATIONS BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPOSITION.  USAID 
VENEZUELA'S PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE MAJORITY OF 
VENEZUELANS WHO DEEPLY WISH TO MOVE FORWARD POLITICALLY SO 
AS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE GRAVE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 
CURRENTLY BESETTING THE COUNTRY.

¶4.  USAID IS SUPPORTING TWO COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH THE 
NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 
(NDI). THE FIRST AGREEMENT PROVIDES $770,000 TO WORK WITH 
CIVIL SOCIETY TO HELP ENSURE THE TRANSPARENCY AND INTEGRITY 
OF ELECTORAL PROCESSES THROUGH DOMESTIC OBSERVATION.  THIS 
PROJECT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH A CONSORTIUM OF GROUPS 
AFFILIATED BOTH WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPOSITION. 
SPECIFICALLY THE CONSORTIUM WILL FOCUS ON OBSERVING: 
POLITICAL/CIVIL/HUMAN RIGHTS, THE QUALITY OF THE ELECTORAL 
PROCESS INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES, AND MEDIA 
    REPORTING. 
¶5.  THE SECOND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WITH NDI PROVIDES 
$550,000 TO STRENGTHEN POLITICAL PARTIES AND ENCOURAGE 
COALITION BUILDING.  THIS PROJECT IS JUST GETTING UNDERWAY 
WITH THE RECENT ARRIVAL OF THE PROJECT MANAGER BUT ALREADY 
HAS MADE A NUMBER OF KEY CONTACTS IN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE 
OPPOSITION WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SUPPORT 
THE PROJECT. 
¶6.  USAID IS ALSO SUPPORTING TWO COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH 
THE INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN INSTITUTE (IRI).  THE FIRST, 
FOR $450,000, IS TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO POLITICAL PARTIES ON 
THE DESIGN, PLANNING, AND EXECUTION OF ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS. 
THIS IS BEING DONE THROUGH "CAMPAIGN TRAINING SCHOOLS" 
TARGETING CAMPAIGN MANAGERS.  THE EMPHASIS IS ON THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF VIABLE CAMPAIGN STRATEGIES AND EFFECTIVELY 
COMMUNICATING PARTY PLATFORMS TO VOTERS.  DIVIDED INTO SIX 
TWO-DAY MODULES, THE TRAINING IS BEING OFFERED IN FIVE 
REGIONAL CENTERS.  TO DATE THE FIRST MODULES HAVE BEEN 
OFFERED IN CARACAS (INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE 
STATES OF VARGAS (ARAGUA, GUARICO AND AMAZONAS), ZULIA 
(TACHIRA, FALCON, BARINAS, MERIDA, TRUJILLO AND APURE), 
ANZOATEGUI (AMACURO, MONAGAS, SUCRE, AND NUEVA ESPARTA)AND 
CARABOBO (LARA, COJEDES, GUARICO, AND YARACUY).  PARTICIPANT 
RESPONSE HAS BEEN UNIFORMLY ENTHUSIASTIC, AND AT LEAST IN 
ZULIA STATE, INVOLVED PARTICIPANTS FROM A BROAD SPECTRUM OF 
 
CARACAS 00000501  001.2 OF 003

HIGHLY POLARIZED POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT.  THIS IS AN AREA TO 
WHICH IRI IS COMMITTED TO GIVING SERIOUS ATTENTION.  END 
COMMENT.) 
¶7.  THE SECOND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WITH IRI, FOR $285,000, 
IS TO SUPPORT THE TRAINING OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE 
OBSERVATION OF ELECTORAL PROCESSES.  WORKING THROUGH A LOCAL 
    NGO, HAGAMOS DEMOCRACIA (HD), AND IN COLLABORATION WITH THE 
NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL, IRI/HD IS DEVELOPING EDUCATIONAL 
MATERIALS FOR THE TRAINING OF POLL WATCHERS.  THE FOCUS OF 
THE TRAINING - WHICH HAS ALREADY BEGUN WITH TRAINING OF 16 
TRAINERS - IS ON OBSERVATION, ASSESSMENT, AND REPORTING. AN 
IMPORTANT EXPECTED OUTCOME OF THIS PROJECT IS THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF A FORMAL NETWORK OF CONTACTS AND VOLUNTEER 
TRAINERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. 
¶8.  USAID HAS AWARDED THREE GRANTS TO THE CARTER CENTER. 
THE FIRST, FOR $580,000, IS AN INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT GRANT. 
THIS FUNDING HAS ENABLED THE CARTER CENTER TO CONTINUE 
FACILITATING RECONCILIATION EFFORTS AIMED AT CALMING THE 
POLITICAL CRISIS.  A SECOND GRANT OF $100,000 SUPPORTED THE 
CARTER CENTER'S OBSERVATION OF THE RECENT SIGNATURE- 
GATHERING DRIVES.  A FOLLOW-ON GRANT OF $60,000 IS 
SUPPORTING THE CARTER CENTER'S PARTICIPATION IN THE 
VERIFICATION PROCESS. 
¶9.  WITH DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVES, INC. (DAI), USAID 
VENEZUELA IS IMPLEMENTING A $3.5 MILLION PROGRAM OF SMALL 
GRANTS, PRIMARILY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH VENEZUELAN CIVIL 
SOCIETY.  DURING THE PAST YEAR THE PRIMARY FOCUS HAS BEEN TO 
FACILITATE DIALOGUE BETWEEN SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY WHO WOULD 
NOT NECESSARILY TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN TOGETHER TO 
DISCUSS ISSUES OF MUTUAL INTEREST.  THE 70-PLUS GRANTS TO 
DATE HAVE MOSTLY SUPPORTED WORKSHOPS DEDICATED TO SPECIFIC 
ISSUES SUCH AS FAMILY VIOLENCE, MUNICIPAL PLANNING, AND THE 
ROLE OF THE MEDIA IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. 
-------------------------- 
NEXT STEPS - FY2004 FOCUS 
-------------------------- 
¶10.  WHILE PROVIDING A SPACE FOR DIALOGUE AND RECONCILIATION 
    WILL CONTINUE TO BE ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE SMALL 
GRANTS PROGRAM, THE EMPHASIS FOR FY 2004 ALSO INCLUDES THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL AGENDA/VISION FOR THE FUTURE. 
CURRENTLY THERE ARE MORE THAN 30 EXISTING NATIONAL AGENDAS, 
AN INDICATION THAT THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF 
INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS WHO RECOGNIZE THE PRESSING 
NEED TO HAVE A VISION FOR THE FUTURE RATHER THAN FALLING 
BACK ON COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PAST AND THE PRESENT.  THIS 
PROJECT WILL WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OF THE EXISTING NATIONAL 
AGENDAS TO DEVELOP A MORE COMPREHENSIVE VISION THAT WILL 
THEN BE VALIDATED IN A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS HELD THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY.  THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO INCREASE CITIZEN 
PARTICIPATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL AGENDA - TO 
ENCOURAGE OWNERSHIP - AND TO MAKE A CLEAR STATEMENT TO 
POLITICAL LEADERS REGARDING EXPECTATIONS OF THE CITIZENS OF 
VENEZUELA. 
¶11.  ANOTHER UPCOMING PROJECT IS A NATION-WIDE CAMPAIGN TO 
BE LAUNCHED IN LATE FEBRUARY, WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE THE 
CONCEPT OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND 
ORGANIZATIONS WITH STRONGLY CONTRASTING OPINIONS.  THIS 
CAMPAIGN WILL INCLUDE A HEAVY MEDIA COMPONENT AND STRONG 
SUPPORT BY CIVIL SOCIETY WHO WILL IMPLEMENT NUMEROUS 
LOCALIZED PROJECTS IN SUPPORT OF "CONVIVENCIA" - LIVING 
TOGETHER IN PEACE.  INITIAL REACTION TO THE PROJECT HAS BEEN 
OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE, A CLEAR DEMONSTRATION THAT 
VENEZUELANS ARE TIRED OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TURMOIL AND 
WANT TO MOVE FORWARD. 
¶12.  PROJECTS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION REGARDING ELECTORAL 
PROCESSES WILL ALSO COMPRISE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DAI 
SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM FOR FY 2004 IN ORDER TO COUNTER-BALANCE 
THE INEVITABLE FLOW OF RUMOR AND MISINFORMATION. ALSO 
    INCLUDED IN THIS COMPONENT WILL BE PROJECTS DEALING WITH 
CIVIC EDUCATION ON THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF 
CITIZENS IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.  AS A COMPLEMENT, 
CONTINUED EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA 
IN A DEMOCRACY. 
¶13.  GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE USAID VENEZUELA PORTFOLIO - AND 
THE COMPLICATED AND FLUID NATURE OF THE VENEZUELAN POLITICAL 
LANDSCAPE - USAID'S IMPACT TO DATE IS HARD TO ASSESS. 
CERTAINLY THE USG IS BETTER ENGAGED AS A RESULT OF PROJECT 
ACTIVITIES CAREFULLY COORDINATED IN THE EMBASSY IN SUPPORT 
OF USG OBJECTIVES.  FUNDING FOR THE CARTER CENTER CONTINUES 
TO SUPPORT CRITICAL ACTIVITIES.  AT MINIMUM, AS A RESULT OF 
THE NDI, IRI, AND DAI ACTIVITIES THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED 
DIALOGUE BETWEEN GROUPS THAT WOULD NOT NORMALLY INTERACT. 
IT IS ALSO EVIDENT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF 
INTERESTING INITIATIVES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THE DAI 
ACTIVITIES. (NOTE:  THE DAI PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OFFICERS ARE 
CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF FOLLOWING UP ON COMPLETED 
PROJECTS TO DETERMINE THEIR IMPACT SO AS TO INCORPORATE 
LESSONS INTO FUTURE PROGRAMMING.  END NOTE.)

AGENDAS TO DEVELOP A MORE COMPREHENSIVE VISION THAT WILL 
THEN BE VALIDATED IN A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS HELD THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY.  THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO INCREASE CITIZEN 
PARTICIPATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL AGENDA - TO 
ENCOURAGE OWNERSHIP - AND TO MAKE A CLEAR STATEMENT TO 
POLITICAL LEADERS REGARDING EXPECTATIONS OF THE CITIZENS OF 
VENEZUELA. 
¶11.  ANOTHER UPCOMING PROJECT IS A NATION-WIDE CAMPAIGN TO 
BE LAUNCHED IN LATE FEBRUARY, WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE THE 
CONCEPT OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND 
ORGANIZATIONS WITH STRONGLY CONTRASTING OPINIONS.  THIS 
CAMPAIGN WILL INCLUDE A HEAVY MEDIA COMPONENT AND STRONG 
SUPPORT BY CIVIL SOCIETY WHO WILL IMPLEMENT NUMEROUS 
LOCALIZED PROJECTS IN SUPPORT OF "CONVIVENCIA" - LIVING 
TOGETHER IN PEACE.  INITIAL REACTION TO THE PROJECT HAS BEEN 
OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE, A CLEAR DEMONSTRATION THAT 
VENEZUELANS ARE TIRED OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TURMOIL AND 
WANT TO MOVE FORWARD. 
¶12.  PROJECTS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION REGARDING ELECTORAL 
PROCESSES WILL ALSO COMPRISE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DAI 
SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM FOR FY 2004 IN ORDER TO COUNTER-BALANCE 
THE INEVITABLE FLOW OF RUMOR AND MISINFORMATION. ALSO 
    INCLUDED IN THIS COMPONENT WILL BE PROJECTS DEALING WITH 
CIVIC EDUCATION ON THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF 
CITIZENS IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.  AS A COMPLEMENT, 
CONTINUED EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA 
IN A DEMOCRACY. 
¶13.  GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE USAID VENEZUELA PORTFOLIO - AND 
THE COMPLICATED AND FLUID NATURE OF THE VENEZUELAN POLITICAL 
LANDSCAPE - USAID'S IMPACT TO DATE IS HARD TO ASSESS. 
CERTAINLY THE USG IS BETTER ENGAGED AS A RESULT OF PROJECT 
ACTIVITIES CAREFULLY COORDINATED IN THE EMBASSY IN SUPPORT 
OF USG OBJECTIVES.  FUNDING FOR THE CARTER CENTER CONTINUES 
TO SUPPORT CRITICAL ACTIVITIES.  AT MINIMUM, AS A RESULT OF 
THE NDI, IRI, AND DAI ACTIVITIES THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED 
DIALOGUE BETWEEN GROUPS THAT WOULD NOT NORMALLY INTERACT. 
IT IS ALSO EVIDENT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF 
INTERESTING INITIATIVES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THE DAI 
ACTIVITIES. (NOTE:  THE DAI PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OFFICERS ARE 
CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF FOLLOWING UP ON COMPLETED 
PROJECTS TO DETERMINE THEIR IMPACT SO AS TO INCORPORATE 
LESSONS INTO FUTURE PROGRAMMING.  END NOTE.)

ANTICIPATING HANDING OVER ITS ACTIVITIES IN FY 2005.  IT IS 
CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT THERE WILL BE A NEED FOR A USAID/OTI- 
TYPE PROGRAM IN VENEZUELA THROUGH EARLY FY 2006 AS VENEZUELA 
PROCEEDS THROUGH THE SCHEDULED ELECTIONS FOR LOCAL AND STATE 
OFFICIALS, NATIONAL LEGISLATORS AND THE PRESIDENCY.  (NOTE: 
DISCUSSIONS ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY IN WASHINGTON AS TO HOW TO 
BEST MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS HANDOVER.  END NOTE.)
