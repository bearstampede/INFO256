SUBJECT: GOB APPROVES NEW UNHCR OPERATION 
 
REF: RANGOON 172 
 
¶1.  (SBU) UNHCR Director for Asia and the Pacific, Mr. Jean 
Marie Fakhouri, told Rangoon diplomatic corps February 13 
that the GOB was giving UNHCR the green light to enter Karen 
(Kayin) State, Mon State, and Tenasserim (Tanintharyi) 
Division and conduct limited operations beginning March 1. 
Fakhouri corroborated the details of the operations as 
foreshadowed by UNHCR Country Representative to COM on Feb 5 
(reftel).  He highlighted that initial operations will be 
limited to "roving presence" UNHCR teams that will assess 
infrastructure upgrades required to support the possible 
return of Karen refugees and IDPs. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Fakhouri explained that UNHCR wants to dampen Thai 
hopes for quick refugee returns to Burma and is focused on 
avoiding a repeat of the 1996 rushed return of Mon refugees 
following the New Mon State Party cease-fire.  Fakhouri 
estimated UNHCR will need $800,000 to $1 million this year 
for the Phase 1 roving presence operations, and will brief 
donors once back in Geneva.  Fakhouri also expressed concern 
about the pervasive mine problem in the region.
