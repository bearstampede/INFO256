Madrid Pledges Not Yet Fulfilled 
--------------------------------- 
¶1.     (SBU) The Dutch have not yet delivered their EUR 10 
million Madrid pledges but are in the process of doing so. 
They expect to release EUR 5 million to the UN/World Bank 
Trust fund in April 2004.  The other EUR 5 million, which was 
pledged for humanitarian assistance, is expected to be 
dispersed via Dutch and international NGOs before the summer. 
 This information comes from Ms. Hagar Ligtvoet of the MFA's 
Peacebuilding and Good Governance Division.  The message from 
the MFA continues to be that the Netherlands does not plan to 
contribute ODA funds to Iraq in the future.  Contributions 
will be limited to humanitarian assistance and small 
reconstruction activities related to the Dutch military 
mission in Al-Muthana. 
 
Dutch Presence at Abu Dhabi Meeting 
----------------------------------- 
¶2.     (U) The Dutch have not yet announced whom they will 
send to the Feb. 28-29 Abu Dhabi meeting (ref B) but Iraq 
desk officer Josephine Frantzen predicts it will be someone 
from the Dutch embassy in the UAE.
