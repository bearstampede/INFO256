Demarche was delivered to Silvia Corado, Director of the 
Office of Multilateral Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign 
Relations upon receipt.  A follow-up phone call elicited from 
Ms. Corado that the GRULAC had met to discuss the issue on 
the fringes of an FAO meeting in Rome to prepare a 
coordinated GRULAC response.  She did not know the outcome of 
that meeting.
