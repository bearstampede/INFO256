SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH PRESIDENT SCHUSTER ON 
UKRAINE, EGYPT, PRESIDENTIAL RACE 
 
REF: KIEV 129 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR RONALD WEISER FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 

¶1. (C) SUMMARY.  AMBASSADOR WEISER MET WITH SLOVAK PRESIDENT 
RUDOLF SCHUSTER ON JANUARY 28.  THEY DISCUSSED HIS 
CONVERSATION THAT MORNING WITH UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT LEONID 
KUCHMA, WHO IS SEEKING A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO ALLOW 
FOR HIS REELECTION.  SCHUSTER ALSO DESCRIBED HIS SUCCESSFUL 
TALKS WITH EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT HOSNI MUBARAK DURING HIS TRIP 
TO EGYPT.  SCHUSTER CONFIRMED HIS CANDIDACY FOR REELECTION 
AND OFFERED PREDICTIONS FOR THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL RACE IN 
SLOVAKIA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (C) PRESIDENT SCHUSTER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR IN A JANUARY 28 
MEETING THAT HE HAD THAT MORNING RECEIVED A CALL FROM 
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT LEONID KUCHMA, WHO SAID HE BELIEVES HE 
HAS THE NECESSARY SUPPORT IN PARLIAMENT FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL 
AMENDMENT TO ALLOW HIM TO RUN FOR REELECTION.  KUCHMA ALSO 
TOLD HIM THAT SIMILAR CALLS HAD BEEN MADE TO THE LEADERS OF 
HUNGARY AND POLAND.  THE AMENDMENT, WHICH NEEDS SIXTY PERCENT 
OF THE VOTES IN PARLIAMENT TO PASS, WOULD CHANGE THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION PROCEDURE FROM A POPULAR VOTE TO A 
PARLIAMENTARY VOTE (FURTHER DETAILS REFTEL).  SCHUSTER SAID 
KUCHMA THINKS ABOUT 75 PERCENT OF MPS WILL SUPPORT THE 
AMENDMENT.  THE APPROXIMATELY 100 SUPPORTERS OF VIKTOR 
YUSHCHENKO WOULD OPPOSE IT.  SCHUSTER NOTED THAT KUCHMA HAD 
REVERSED WHAT HE TOLD HIM LAST YEAR, WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD BE 
LEAVING THE PRESIDENCY.  SCHUSTER ALSO SAID THAT IF REMAINING 
AS PRESIDENT WAS NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION, IT WOULD BE 
DIFFICULT FOR SLOVAKIA TO BE CRITICAL OF ITS NEIGHBOR. 
 
¶3. (C) DURING HIS TRIP TO EGYPT, SCHUSTER HAD A 50-MINUTE 
ONE-ON-ONE MEETING WITH PRESIDENT HOSNI MUBARAK THAT WAS 
    ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED FOR TEN MINUTES.  SCHUSTER DESCRIBED THE 
MEETING AS EXCEEDINGLY CORDIAL.  MUBARAK EXPRESSED STRONG 
APPRECIATION AND SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. POSITION ON MIDDLE EAST 
PEACE TALKS.  HE SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THE SLOVAK POSITION IN 
PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. BOTH MORALLY AND WITH TROOPS 
ON THE GROUND IN IRAQ.  SCHUSTER TOLD THE AMBASSADOR HE FELT 
HE DEVELOPED A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH MUBARAK, WHICH WAS 
REFLECTED IN SOME VERY SUBSTANTIAL AGREEMENTS SIGNED FOR 
FUTURE SLOVAK-EGYPTIAN COMMERCE.  HE SAID THAT THE MINISTERS 
THAT HE MET WITH THE FOLLOWING DAY HAD RELAYED TO HIM THAT 
THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS BY MUBARAK TO MEET THE 
SLOVAK REQUESTS.  THERE WERE ALSO DISCUSSIONS OF EGYPT 
POSSIBLY BUYING SLOVAK-MANUFACTURED ARMS IN THE FUTURE. 
 
¶4. (C) SCHUSTER ALSO MENTIONED THAT HE HAD BEEN INVITED BY 
BAVARIA PREMIER EDMUND STOIBER, THE OPPOSITION CANDIDATE IN 
GERMANY'S LAST CHANCELLOR'S RACE, TO MEET IN MUNICH AT THE 
BEGINNING OF MARCH.  HE INTENDS TO GO TO MUNICH AND DISCUSS, 
AMONG OTHER THINGS, SLOVAK SUPPORT FOR THE POLISH POSITION ON 
THE EU CONSTITUTION. 
 
¶5. (C) ON INTERNAL POLITICS, SCHUSTER INDICATED THAT HE, AND 
MOVEMENT FOR A DEMOCRATIC SLOVAKIA (HZDS) CHAIRMAN VLADIMIR 
MECIAR, WOULD BOTH RUN FOR PRESIDENT.  SCHUSTER PREDICTED HE 
AND MECIAR WOULD BATTLE FOR THE SECOND SPOT IN A RUNOFF WITH 
FOREIGN MINISTER EDUARD KUKAN.  MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRACY (HZD) 
CANDIDATE IVAN GASPAROVIC'S SUPPORT WILL BEGIN TO DROP, 
SCHUSTER SAID.  WHEN THE AMBASSADOR ASKED WHY MECIAR WOULD 
RUN, REALIZING HE COULD NOT WIN, SCHUSTER EXPLAINED THIS WAS 
PART OF MECIAR'S AGREEMENT WITH THE SLOVAK DEMOCRATIC AND 
CHRISTIAN UNION (SDKU) UNDER WHICH HZDS WILL SUPPLY 
    UNOFFICIAL SUPPORT TO THE MINORITY GOVERNMENT IN RETURN FOR 
THEM "LEAVING HIM ALONE."  SCHUSTER EXPECTS SUPPORTERS OF THE 
SMER PARTY WILL SPLIT ON THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE, WITH THOSE 
LED BY PARTY VICE-CHAIR MONIKA BENOVA AND BRATISLAVANS 
SUPPORTING GASPAROVIC AND SMER SUPPORTERS IN EASTERN SLOVAKIA 
VOTING FOR SCHUSTER.  FIVE SMER DEPUTIES FROM THE KOSICE 
REGION HELPED COLLECT THE SIGNATURES OF 15 MPS SUPPORTING HIS 
CANDIDACY, SCHUSTER SAID, AND NEARLY 50,000 SIGNATURES HAVE 
BEEN COLLECTED FROM THE PUBLIC SO FAR, WITH ONLY 15,000 
NEEDED. 
 
¶6. (C) SCHUSTER CONFIRMED TO THE AMBASSADOR THE IMPORTANCE 
THAT HE GIVES TO THE SLOVAK/U.S. RELATIONSHIP AND THAT HE 
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO STRENGTHEN IT.
