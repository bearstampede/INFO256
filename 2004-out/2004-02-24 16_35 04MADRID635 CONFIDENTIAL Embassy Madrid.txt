SUBJECT: SPAIN: ELBARADEI TELLS PALACIO IAEA SHOULD MOVE 
CAUTIOUSLY ON IRAN 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick, 
reasons 1.4(B) and (D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Poloff queried Guillermo Kirkpatrick, the Foreign 
Ministry's Deputy Director General for Disarmament, about 
Minister Palacio's February 19 meeting with IAEA Director 
General ElBaradei in Vienna.  Kirkpatrick said ElBaradei told 
Palacio he was extremely happy with Libya's cooperation with 
the IAEA.  ElBaradei said it would be difficult for Libya to 
be more cooperative. 
 
¶2.  (C) The situation with Iran was more worrisome. 
ElBaradei wants to proceed slowly and cautiously with Iran, 
so Iran does not feel threatened and turn into another North 
Korea.  He emphasized that where Libya has "locked up" and 
made available for inspection its nuclear program equipment, 
Iran has only suspended its enrichment activities.  Iran's 
nuclear program is far more developed than Libya's and could 
be restarted at any moment.  It will be important, said 
ElBaradei, not to provoke Iran, but rather to coax it into 
cooperating with the international community and eventually 
abandoning its program.
