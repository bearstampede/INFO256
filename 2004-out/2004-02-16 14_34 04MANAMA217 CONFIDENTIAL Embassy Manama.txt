Bahraini Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr. Muhammad 
Abd al-Ghaffar agreed with our position on the possible 
Algerian CHR resolution on Iraq in response to CDA's February 
16 delivery of reftel demarche.  Abd al-Ghaffar promised to 
contact their PermRep in Geneva (also the CHR Vice Chairman 
for this term) and ask him to intervene quietly to convince 
the Algerians to cease their initiative.  The CDA's demarche 
followed up on POL/ECON Chief's delivery of reftel demarche 
on February 15 to MFA International Organization Affairs 
Director Ghassan Shaikho.
