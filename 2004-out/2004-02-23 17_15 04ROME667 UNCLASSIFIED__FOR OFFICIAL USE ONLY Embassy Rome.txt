¶1. ITALY'S TRANSPORT MINISTRY DIRECTOR FOR MARITIME AFFAIRS, 
COSIMO CALIENDO, AND HIS DEPUTY, DR. GIORDANO, WHO 
REPRESENTED ITALY AT THE FEBRUARY 9 MEETING, TOLD SCIENCE 
COUNSELOR FEBRUARY 17 THAT ITALY HAD BEEN SATISFIED WITH THE 
RESULTS OF THE MEETING ON THE BALLAST WATER TREATY.  THEY 
FELT THAT A GOOD BALANCE HAD BEEN STRUCK BETWEEN WHAT HE 
TERMED "THE RESTRICTIVE, ENVIRONMENTALLY-PROTECTIVE" U.S. 
POSITION AND THE "LESS RESTRICTIVE" NORWEGIAN POSITION. 
 
¶2.  RATIFICATION:  CALIENDO ANTICIPATED THAT THE EU MEMBER 
STATES WILL COORDINATE THEIR RATIFICATIONS AND DO THEM MORE 
OR LESS AT THE SAME TIME.  HE SEES NO DIFFICULTY WITH 
RATIFICATION IN ITALY.  CALIENDO ASKED WHEN THE U.S. MIGHT 
RATIFY THE TREATY.
