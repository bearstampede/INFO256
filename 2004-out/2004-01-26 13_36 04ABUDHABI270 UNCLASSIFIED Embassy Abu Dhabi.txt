SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  VP CHENEY'S SPEECH 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY'S SPEECH RECEIVED 
PROMINENT COVERAGE IN LOCAL PRINT MEDIA.  AN ARTICLE IN DUBAI- 
BASED BUSINESS-ORIENTED "AL BAYAN" WRITTEN BY COLUMNIST HAMAD 
SALMAIN NOTED THAT THE SPEECH ASSURES THE CONTINUATION OF U.S.'S 
EFFORTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, CONTRARY TO 
PRESIDENT BUSH'S SPEECH, WHERE MIDDLE EAST ISSUES WERE NEVER 
MENTIONED.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  ". THIS AMERICAN ATTITUDE CAME LATE AFTER LONG YEARS OF 
DEALING WITH GOVERNMENTS; THE U.S. REALIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
COMMUNICATION WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE REGION, NOT ONLY THEIR 
GOVERNMENTS.  AS THE SLOGAN SAYS 'BETTER LATER THAN NEVER,' THIS 
BROADER AMERICAN AWARENESS OF THE REGION WILL OPEN THE ROAD TO 
ACHIEVE BENEFITS FOR BOTH THE U.S. AND COUNTRIES OF THE REGION. 
CHENEY'S SPEECH WAS CLEAR AND BALANCED WHEN IT COMES TO 
TERRORISM, IT ALSO MENTIONED MOST OF THE IMPORTANT MIDDLE EAST 
ISSUES, CONTRARY TO PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH'S STATE OF THE UNION 
SPEECH THAT IGNORED THE PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI CONFLICT.  BUT 
CHENEY'S REMARKS REGARDING THE PEACE PROCESS AND THE PALESTINIAN 
CAUSE WERE REPETITIVE AND NO DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF AMERICAN 
OFFICIALS, AND THEY WERE ALSO UNFAIR REGARDING THE REFORM PROCESS 
IN THE ARAB COUNTRIES, SINCE HE MENTIONED SOME COUNTRIES WITHOUT 
DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THOSE WHICH HAD ALREADY IMPLEMENTED REFORM 
AND THOSE WHICH HAVE MERELY STARTED TO DISCUSS REFORM."
