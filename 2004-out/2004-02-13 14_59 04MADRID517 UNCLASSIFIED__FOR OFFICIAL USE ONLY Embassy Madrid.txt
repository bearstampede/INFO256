REF:  STATE 28688 
 
¶1.  (U) As directed in REFTEL, the following responses 
constitute the SEPQ for Mission Spain.  The responses 
will directly correlate in sequence with the questions 
asked.  All questions and responses have been coordinated 
with the appropriate Emergency Action Committee (EAC). 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  POLITICAL VIOLENCE: 
 
DEMONSTRATIONS: 
 
¶A. There is a significant Islamic presence in Spain that 
could feasibly mount demonstrations.  Others of mixed 
ethnic and religious backgrounds recently protested 
against American policy in Iraq. 
 
¶B. Yes. 
 
¶C. Yes 
 
¶D. The recent anti-American demonstrations have related 
directly to the "no-war-in-Iraq" movement, with specific 
implications attached to the death of a Spanish 
journalist in Iraq.  The past year's demonstrations have 
ranged from 50 to 500 persons in front of the Embassy and 
the Consulate General in Barcelona, to 2 million persons 
in a coordinated nation-wide demonstration. 
 
¶E. Normally triggered by opposition to U.S. Policy on the 
war in Iraq and some relating to the death of a Spanish 
journalist in Iraq. 
 
¶F. Generally peaceful, but on occasion during the Iraq 
incursion, some minor violence was witnessed. 
 
¶G. The only symptoms of violence were from the throwing 
of paint and fruit at the Embassy, Consulate General, and 
various Consular Agencies. 
 
¶H. During one demonstration in Barcelona, one person 
cleared the perimeter wall and entered the grounds of the 
Consulate General before being chased off. 
 
¶I. Yes. 
 
¶J. Yes, near and in-front of Mission facilities in- 
country.

conjunction with the anti-American demonstrations and the 
response as to numbers of demonstrators is the same as in 
(D). 
 
¶L. Generally peaceful, but on occasion, some minor 
violence has been witnessed. 
 
¶M. N/A 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MACRO CONFLICT CONDITIONS:

ETA. 
 
¶B. ETA acts of terrorism have been carried out in all 
areas of the country including Madrid and Barcelona. 
 
¶C. N/A 
 
¶D. No. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) HOST COUNTRY CAPABILITIES:

DHS/ICE and the FBI has been incorporated into practical 
use and used against ETA terrorism. 
 
¶C. No. 
 
¶D. Yes. 
 
¶E. Yes. 
 
¶F. Yes, for example in recent captures of Al-Qaida cells 
and against ETA and recent GRAPO operations. 
¶G. Yes. 
 
¶H. Very good with respect to flights to the U.S. 
 
¶I. Average. 
¶J. Average.  As a Schengen country, the borders are

¶6.  (SBU) OTHER INDIGENOUS TERRORIST GROUPS: 
 
¶A. Yes. 
 
¶B. ETA, GRAPO.  However, none have ever specifically 
targeted Americans.  Therefore, they are indigenous and 
they are a terrorist group. 
 
¶C. Yes. 
 
¶D. Yes. 
 
¶E. Yes.  In 1985, an explosion triggered by ETA killed an 
American citizen passer-by. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM: 
 
TRANSNATIONAL TERRORIST INDICATORS: 
 
¶A. Yes.  Al-Qaida, FARC, ELN, GIA, GSPC. 
 
¶B. The presence is operational, financial, support, and 
propaganda in cell structure. 
 
¶C. No. 
 
¶D. Yes. 
 
¶E. Yes.  Owing to its geographic location, Spain has a 
large Muslim population, some of which is undoubtedly 
sympathetic to the Jihadi cause.  Terrorist organizations 
are known to have used Spain's large Islamic population 
as a recruiting ground. 
 
¶F. It is possible with Spain being a strong ally and 
currently having troops positioned in Iraq, and being a 
high-profile proponent of the fight against terrorism, 
that there could be attacks or other terrorist acts 
against Americans in Spain. 
 
¶G. Weapons and explosive materials are available and can 
be acquired.
