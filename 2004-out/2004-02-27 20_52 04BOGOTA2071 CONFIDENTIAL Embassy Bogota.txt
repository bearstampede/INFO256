Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) On February 23, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia's (FARC) Teofilo Forero Mobile Column (TFMC) 
launched simultaneous attacks on a luxury residential complex 
in Neiva, Huila department, the city's power grid, and an 
isolated military outpost west of the city.  A quick police 
response prevented a mass kidnapping in Neiva, although 
guerrillas escaped with two wealthy hostages.  The Army, 
which lost at least 12 soldiers during the FARC's assault on 
the military base, failed to respond to either the kidnapping 
or the attack on the base, which lasted five hours. 
President Uribe responded to the setback by requesting the 
resignation of military and civilian intelligence officials, 
including the commander of the Ninth Brigade and the local 
director of the Department of Administrative Security (DAS). 
Local press coverage is calling this the most ambitious FARC 
operation in months, and a setback for the government.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
A Well-Planned Attack 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) In one of its most well-coordinated, dramatic 
operations since its bombing of Bogota's El Nogal social club 
in February 2003, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC) coordinated nearly simultaneous attacks on a luxury 
condominium complex in Neiva, capital of Huila department, 
the city's power grid, and an isolated military outpost west 
of the city.  At around 11:00 p.m. on February 23, 
approximately 20 guerrillas from the FARC's Teofilo Forero 
Mobile Column (TFMC) arrived at a luxury condominium complex 
on the outskirts of Neiva.  Dressed as Army GAULA 
(anti-kidnapping) officials and using vehicles similar to 
those used by the Army, they presented false documentation to 
the complex's private security guards that allowed them to 
obtain access to the high-security residential community. 
Once inside, they immobilized the guards and kidnapped 
residents of pre-selected apartments, blowing down front 
doors with explosives when necessary.  All told, the FARC 
attempted to kidnap approximately 30 persons, including 
prominent local businessman Luis Ernesto Bernal and cattle 
rancher Luis Fernando Borrero, reportedly a personal friend 
of President Uribe. 
 
¶3. (C) The Colombian National Police (CNP), who were on high 
alert because of intelligence pointing to an imminent attack, 
responded immediately, forcing the guerrillas to release all 
but two of their hostages before they left the complex. 
Three CNP officers and one civilian were injured in the gun 
battle.  The guerrillas, following a well-planned escape 
route lined with obstacles and booby-traps that slowed police 
pursuit, managed to escape with Bernal and Borrero.  Their 
escape took place in total darkness, thanks to a successful 
FARC attack on the city's power grid. 
 
¶4. (C) Simultaneous to the Neiva kidnapping operation, in an 
apparent diversionary attack, the TFMC assaulted an isolated 
Army outpost west of Neiva.  The five-hour attack included 
the use of gas cylinder bombs and left at least 12 of the 
post's 35 soldiers dead.  The Army's 9th Brigade, based in 
Neiva, which did not respond to the mass kidnapping attempt, 
also failed to send reinforcements to the isolated base under 
assault. 
 
--------------- 
A Proven Tactic 
--------------- 
 
¶5. (C) Disguising themselves as Colombian government 
authorities to gain access to homes and government facilities 
is a time-proven FARC tactic.  The TFMC conducted similar 
kidnappings at another luxury apartment complex in Neiva in 
July 2001 and Cali's provincial assembly headquarters in 
April 2002.  Over 20 hostages from those mass kidnappings are 
still in FARC hands. 
------------------------- 
Zero Tolerance From Uribe 
------------------------- 
¶6. (C) President Uribe held regional and national leaders of 
the security forces responsible for failing to anticipate and 
prevent the attacks, immediately requesting the resignations 
of the Army's Ninth Brigade commander, the military's 
National GAULA director and local Huila director, and the 
director, deputy director, and intelligence chief of the 
Department of Administrative Security's (DAS) Huila office. 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7. (C) Local press coverage is declaring this 
near-destruction of a military outpost and major attack 
against civilians in a high-security residential complex the 
largest FARC attack in months and a clear setback.  In 
contrast to the Cali and 2001 Neiva kidnappings, however, the 
CNP's preparation and response prevented a much larger 
kidnapping.
