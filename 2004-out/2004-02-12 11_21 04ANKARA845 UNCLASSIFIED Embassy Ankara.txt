We inquired February 10 as to the status of Turkey's 
instruments of ratification for new NATO members, which we 
had been told would be finalized in October 2003 (ref A).  A 
MFA NATO desk officer said the documents were currently being 
reviewed by the Presidency before being deposited.  Noting 
that plans were being considered to admit the new members as 
soon as possible, we urged the GOT to finalize the process 
and deposit the instruments by the end of February.  The desk 
officer believed the GOT would do so.
