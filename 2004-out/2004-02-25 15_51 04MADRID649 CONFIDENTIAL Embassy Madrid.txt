¶1. (U) Please see action request in paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (C) We delivered reftel demarche to Inigo de Palacio, MFA 
Director of UN Affairs, on February 24.  De Palacio stated 
that while Spain and the EU would support renewing Israel's 
WEOG New York membership in May, the EU's common policy is to 
"give a flat no" to granting Israel full WEOG privileges. 
According to De Palacio, Europe agreed to WEOG New York 
membership for Israel because the New York forum does not 
involve political coordination.  He added that the GOS "does 
not want to have to discuss political issues with Israel in 
Geneva", as he believes Israel disregards the decisions that 
the UNHRC passes on Israeli matters.  Furthermore, De Palacio 
stated that Israel does not belong in WEOG, and that Europe 
only allowed their inclusion in WEOG New York to be fair to 
Israel since the Israelis were excluded from the Asia group. 
 
¶3. (C) De Palacio claimed that limited WEOG membership for 
Israel had explicitly been a condition when Europe agreed to 
their temporary inclusion.  Regarding the reftel talking 
point that mentions that Australia and New Zealand were not 
members of WEOG Nairobi, De Palacio said he was surprised, as 
he believes that Australia and New Zealand are full members 
of all WEOG venues.  He asked for Washington's reasoning 
behind that claim. 
 
¶4. (C) Action request.  Per De Palacio's request for 
clarification of the statement that Australia and New Zealand 
are not members of WEOG Nairobi, Post requests background on 
the status and extent of WEOG membership for Australia and 
New Zealand. End action request.
