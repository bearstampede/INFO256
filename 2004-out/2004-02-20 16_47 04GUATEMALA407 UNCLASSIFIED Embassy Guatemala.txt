Banrural and Genesis Empresaria are well known and respected 
Guatemalan financial institutions.  USAID continues to work 
with both organizations and has separately provided detailed 
comments on the proposal.  Both institutions have 
micro-finance experience, and Banrural in particular has a 
wide reach, working in the more remote areas of Guatemala. 
Consultations with various private sector elements, NGOs and 
financial supervision officials revealed no serious concerns 
about either institution.  Post supports the intent of the 
project and the use of these organizations.
