REASON 1.4 (B) & (D) 
 
 ¶1.  (C)  Poloff delivered reftel points to Esther 
Monterrubio, Director General for Eastern Europe at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Monterrubio said that Spain, as 
an EU member, is monitoring elections in the Ukraine very 
carefully.  She agreed with our position that the Ukraine's 
accession to EU institutions would depend on whether the 
upcoming elections are conducted in a free, fair, and 
transparent manner.  Changes in the constitution should be 
discussed in open forum outside the election period, she 
said.  In this respect, Spain welcomed President Kuchma's 
announcement that he would not seek a third term. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Monterrubio also stated that given the March 14 
general elections in Spain, there are no plans in the near or 
medium term for any direct meeting between senior Spanish 
officials and Kuchma.
