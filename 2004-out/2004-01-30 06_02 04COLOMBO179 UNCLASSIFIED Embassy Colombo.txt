AMBASSADOR'S FUND FOR REFUGEES REQUEST 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Just want to flag for you that Post has submitted 
a request for funding through the 2004 Ambassador's Fund for

LATEST ON SLFP-JVP ALLIANCE 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) FYI.  The SLFP-JVP link-up, now entitled the 
"United People's Freedom Alliance" (UPFA), continues to 
generate news.  The following are some recent 
developments: 
 
-- The newly formed alliance held its first political 
meeting on January 29, with a rally attended by several 
thousand supporters in Colombo.  Both JVP and SLFP 
officials made remarks, including UK-based JVP leader 
Somawansa Amarasinghe.  A speech marking the occasion by 
President Kumaratunga, who did not attend the January 29 
rally, was also read to the crowds.  In it, the 
President recognized the "policy differences" between 
the SLFP and the JVP, but stated that the two parties 
"will compromise to find a permanent solution to the 
ethnic conflict and establish a lasting peace." 
 
-- The alliance, itself, continues to evolve.  Douglas 
Devananda, leader of the Eelam People's Democratic Party 
(EPDP), an anti-LTTE Tamil political party, has said his 
group has joined the alliance.  The anti-Rauf Hakeem 
Muslim party, the National Unity Alliance (NUA), is also 
considering joining.  Meanwhile, some small 
(traditional) leftist parties within the President's 
People's Alliance (PA) have stated they will not be part 
of the SLFP-JVP link-up because they are disturbed by 
its potential impact on the peace process. 
 
-- There have also been slight indications that 
President Kumaratunga's children are not happy with the 
link-up between the two parties.  While never proven, it 
has been strongly alleged that the JVP was behind the 
late 1980's assassination of the their father, Vijaya 
Kumaratunga.  According to media reports, Sunethra 
Bandaranaike, President Kumaratunga's sister, has also 
expressed her displeasure over the link-up. 
 
NEW HEAD FOR MONITORING MISSION 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) FYI.  Retired Norwegian Major General Trond 
Furuhovde will arrive in Colombo on January 31 to take 
up duties as head of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission 
(SLMM).  Furuhovde was previously posted to Sri Lanka, 
serving as the head of the monitoring group from 2002- 
¶2003.  Furuhovde replaces Tryggve Teleffsen, another 
retired Norwegian military officer, who was recalled to 
Norway after President Kumaratunga called for his ouster 
in October 2003.  Teleffsen is now serving in Jerusalem 
as the head of a monitoring mission there.  (POL)
