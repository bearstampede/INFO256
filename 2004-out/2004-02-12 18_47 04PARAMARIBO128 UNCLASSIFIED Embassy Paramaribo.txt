SUBJECT: SURINAME BANS IMPORT OF US CHICKEN 
 
 
    ON FEBRUARY 12, DIRECTOR OF ANIMAL PRODUCTION AND HEALTH IN 
THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, LIVESTOCK, AND FISHERIES EDMUND 
ROZENBLAD ANNOUNCED IN THE DAILY SURINAME TIMES THAT 
SURINAME HAS BANNED THE IMPORT OF US CHICKEN UNTIL FURTHER 
NOTICE.  ROZENBLAD INFORMED THE EMBASSY THAT THE BAN IS A 
PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE.  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE AVIAN FLU 
OUTBREAK IN DELAWARE COULD EXPAND TO SOUTHERN STATES LIKE 
GEORGIA OR FLORIDA, WHICH PRODUCE MOST OF THE CHICKEN THAT 
SURINAME IMPORTS.  ROZENBLAD FURTHER STATED THAT CHICKEN 
IMPORTERS ALREADY HAVE BEEN INFORMED ABOUT THE BAN. 
SHIPMENTS FROM THE US THAT ARE ALREADY ON THEIR WAY WILL BE 
ACCEPTED SINCE THESE CONTAINERS WERE SHIPPED BEFORE THE 
OUTBREAK OF THE AVIAN FLU.
