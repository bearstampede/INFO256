¶1. (SBU) On Thursday January 29, 2004, Post received an 
Unclassified E-MAIL from the Foreign Minister of the self 
 
SIPDIS 
proclaimed State of Somaliland, Edna Adan Ismail claiming an 
unconfirmed threat to the sea ports of Djibouti and Berbera. 
Ismail sent this report to Post's Executive OMS using her 
internet Yahoo.com account.  Ismail states the following in 
her E-MAIL: 
 
BEGIN QUOTE - There are some unconfirmed reports that there 
is a plot to attack the ports of Djibouti and Berbera.  The 
attack is threatened from the North east Coast of Somalia. 
We are keeping our eyes open and would advise that just an 
extra vigilance be exercised at your end.  Although we hope 
that this turns out to be a false alarm.  It does not do any 
harm to be alert and trust that you will take the necessary 
measures.  With best regards, Edna Adan Ismail.  END QUOTE. 
 
¶2. (S/NF) RSO, CDA and COS discussed the content of the 
E-MAIL and felt it prudent to share the information with Host 
Nation sources to determine the validity of the threat. 
Taking into consideration the information from Ismail, the 
Host Nation immediately discounted the information sighting 
several political reasons why the threat is unlikely.  RSO 
and COS concur with the Host Nation and believe that this is 
not a viable threat nor does it pose any risk to Americans, 
coalition partners or Western interests.  That being said, 
the Host Nation advised that it would take the necessary 
precautions and closely monitor activity at the port. 
 
¶3. (S/NF) It must be noted that there has been a rivalry 
brewing between Puntland and Somaliland.  Somaliland has had 
increasingly good relations with the Government of Djibouti 
(GODJ) while Puntland continues to criticize the GODJ for 
providing arms support to Somaliland.  The GODJ has strongly 
denied such support.  This reporting from Ismail could be 
evidence that Somaliland continues to nurture hope for closer 
Djibouti-US-Somaliland security cooperation. 
 
The self proclaimed government of Somaliland has stated on 
several occasions that it wishes to gain favor and support 
from the USG as an active partner in the Global War on 
Terrorism.  Although Post believes that this sort of 
reporting from Mrs. Ismail could be a sign of button pushing 
it could also be a sign of a closer dialogue evolving between 
the USG and Somaliland.  Key Embassy and Military officers 
have met with Mrs. Ismail on several occasions and she is 
completely aware that the USG has a keen interest in the 
region.  Post expects to receive more communications from 
Ismail in the future.
