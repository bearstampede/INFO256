REF: A. STATE 33396 
     ¶B. STATE 23826 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING POL M/C G. ROBBINS FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (C) SEBASTIANO FULCI, MFA WEST AFRICA OFFICE DIRECTOR 
INFORMED POST THAT ITALY PLANS TO PROVIDE APPROXIMATELY 
150,000 EURO FROM ITS PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS BUDGET FOR THE 
SIERRA LEONE SPECIAL COURT. ITALY PROVIDED 180,000 EURO IN 
2001 AND 260,000 EURO AT THE END OF 2003. 
 
¶2. (C) FULCI EXPLAINED THAT ITALY'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE 
COURT ARE DRAWN FROM ITS PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS BUDGET 
RATHER THAN ITS DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE BUDGET. GIVEN ITALY'S 
CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT IN IRAQ AND IMMINENT REDEPLOYMENT IN 
AFGHANISTAN, RESOURCES FOR OTHER DESERVING INITIATIVES ARE, 
UNFORTUNATELY, EXTREMELY LIMITED. HE EXPRESSED HOPE THAT 
ITALY MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDS AT THE END OF 2004 
AND ALSO MENTIONED THAT THERE IS A REMOTE POSSIBILITY THAT 
THE EU MAY PROVIDE FUNDS FOR THE COURT BUT THAT NO DECISION 
HAS YET BEEN MADE REGARDING EU FUNDING. 
 
¶3. (C) CHARGE PLANS TO REINFORCE OUR POINTS IN A MEETING WITH 
MFA U/S BONIVER ON FRIDAY. POST WILL UPDATE AS APPROPRIATE.
