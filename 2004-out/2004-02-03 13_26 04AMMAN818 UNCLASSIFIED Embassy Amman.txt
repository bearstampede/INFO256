THE JORDANIAN INTERFAITH COEXISTENCE RESEARCH CENTER, 
ESTABLISHED IN 2003, SEEKS TO PROMOTE INTERFAITH COEXISTENCE 
DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, PARTLY BY ESTABLISHING 
DIALOGUE AND INTERNATIONAL TIES, PARTICULARLY WITH ISLAMIC, 
CHRISTIAN, AND JEWISH GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS.  THE PROGRAM 
SUPPORTS THE MISSION GOAL OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND, 
TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE GOALS OF PUBLIC DIPLOMACY AND 
REGIONAL STABILITY.  IT WOULD EXPOSE THESE JORDANIAN 
RELIGIOUS AND SOCIETAL LEADERS TO AMERICAN SOCIETY, WITH A 
PROGRAMMATIC EMPHASIS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND TOLERANCE, 
AND PROMOTE ENDURING CONTACTS WITH AMERICANS ON THESE 
ISSUES. IN ADDITION, THE PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN U.S. ENGAGEMENT WITH JORDANIAN 
LEADERS ON RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE IN THE REGION, A KEY AMERICAN 
VALUE. 
THE PARTICIPANTS ARE UNIQUELY SUITED TO BENEFIT FROM THIS 
PROGRAM. NABIL HADDAD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER AND 
A MELKITE PRIEST, IS A LONGTIME AND FREQUENT CONTACT OF THE 
POLITICAL SECTION.  HE HAS PROVED AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF 
INFORMATION THROUGH HIS INVOLVEMENT IN HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ISSUES, AND WE EXPECT HIS PARTICIPATION IN 
THIS PROGRAM WILL BOTH INCREASE HIS ENGAGEMENT CAPACITY AND 
EXPAND HIS ABILITY TO PROMOTE INTERFAITH DIALOGUE.  H.E. MR. 
IZZEDDIN AL TAMIMI IS JORDAN'S SENIOR ISLAMIC JUDGE AND 
SERVES IN A NUMBER OF OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AND NON- 
GOVERNMENTAL CAPACITIES. THEREFORE, HE HAS DIRECT INFLUENCE 
ON GOJ POLICY AND WOULD BENEFIT THE USG WITH HIS INCREASED 
KNOWLEDGE OF AND TIES TO THE U.S.  MR. SAMI GAMMOH, A FORMER 
GOVERNMENT MINISTER WITH EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE U.S., 
WOULD BENEFIT THE USG WITH HIS INCREASED EXPOSURE TO THIS 
ASPECT OF AMERICAN SOCIETY AND VALUES AND MS. MA'AYTA IS THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE PIONEER WOMEN CENTER, TRAINING AND 
CONSULTATION AND FORMER PARLIAMENT MEMBER.  THE CHRISTIAN- 
MUSLIM COMPOSITION OF THE GROUP IS INDICATIVE OF THE 
DIALOGUE IT PROMOTES.
