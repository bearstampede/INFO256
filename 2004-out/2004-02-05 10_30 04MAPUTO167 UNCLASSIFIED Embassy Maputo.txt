SSH Projects 2003 
----------------- 
¶2. All SSH projects from 2003 should make their final 
payments by September 2004 (a year from when FY 2003 SSH 
projects were signed). In several cases, money has not been 
dispersed because no project invoices have been received. 
Post recently contacted associations and project sponsors 
through phone calls, encouraging them to initiate and finish 
projects so that a timely closeout of FY03 funds will be 
achieved. Post also intends to visit projects, where 
possible, inspect final results, and report success stories.
