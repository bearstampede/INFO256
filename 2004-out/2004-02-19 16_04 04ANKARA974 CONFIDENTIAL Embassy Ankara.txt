CPA FOR AMB. BREMER AND JONES 
 
 
E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/18/2014 
TAGS: PREL ETRD MARR PTER TU IZ
SUBJECT: IRAQ: TURKISH MFA IRAQ COORDINATOR TO VISIT 
BAGHDAD FEB. 24-26, SEEKS MEETING WITH AMB. BREMER 
 
(U) Classified by Ambassador Eric Edelman.  Reasons 1.5 b and 
d. 
 
 
¶1. (C) Ambassador was approached by Turkish MFA Iraq 
Coordinator Osman Koruturk February 18 and called by MFA 
Deputy Undersecretary Ali Tuygan February 19 to seek 
assistance in getting Koruturk a meeting with CPA 
Administrator Bremer during Koruturk's visit to Baghdad 
February 24-26.  While we defer to CPA as to whether Amb. 
Bremer can see Koruturk, we strongly urge that Amb. Jones 
meet him, with Amb. Bremer making a short drop-by if 
possible.  Koruturk's visit offers an excellent opportunity 
for CPA to raise with a credible senior Turkish interlocutor 
the range of issues on the Iraq-Turkey agenda, including: 
cross-border trade, Habur and the possibility of a second 
border crossing, CPA policy on the PKK and its successor and 
front organizations, the northern oil pipeline, police 
trainers for the Jordan training facility, and discrepancies 
in the SOMO and TPIC account figures. 
 
 
¶2. (C) We hope that CPA will take advantage of this 
opportunity and stand ready to assist in any way we can. 
 
 
¶3. (U) Baghdad minimize considered.
