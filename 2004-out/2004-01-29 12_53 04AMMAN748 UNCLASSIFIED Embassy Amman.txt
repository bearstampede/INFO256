SUBJECT: IRAQI POLICE GRADUATION 
 
 
¶1.  The first class of Iraqi police cadets graduated from 
their coursework at the Jordan International Police Training 
Center on January 29.  The 500 cadets were greeted by the 
Iraqi and Jordanian Interior Ministers, CPA senior advisor 
Steve Casteel, senior Jordanian police, and diplomats 
representing those states contributing trainers to the 
program, Austria, Canada, Finland, Sweden, the UK and the 
U.S.  (The ceremony occurred against the backdrop of those 
nations' flags, as well as those of Iraq and Jordan.) 
 
¶2.  In his remarks, Iraqi Interior Minister Badran stressed 
to the cadets their task ahead of defending Iraqis' dignity, 
liberty and human rights.  He said that foundation was 
essential to stabilizing and bringing prosperity to the Iraqi 
society and nation, as well as the region. 
 
¶3.  Morale among the cadets, who appeared disciplined and 
fit, was notably high.  At the end of the dignified ceremony, 
the cadets erupted into congenial high spirits, tossing their 
hats in the air, dancing in celebration, and having their 
photos taken with visiting dignitaries. 
 
¶4.  Press presence was good, and included the BBC, the major 
international wires, Radio Monte Carlo, Radio Sawa, Swedish 
TV, and the local and regional media.
