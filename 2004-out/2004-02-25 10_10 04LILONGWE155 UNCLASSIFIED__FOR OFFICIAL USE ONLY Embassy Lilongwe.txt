     ¶B. 03 LILONGWE 1202 
 
¶1. (U) After dissolving his 45-member Cabinet two days 
earlier, President Muluzi appointed a largely unchanged 
Cabinet on February 24.  Amid the re-shuffle, what changes 
were made reflect the ruling United Democratic Front's (UDF) 
tweakings to position the party for May's elections. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶2. (SBU) Other than sidetracking a government already 
distracted by the May elections, the changes Muluzi made to 
the Cabinet will have little effect on our dealings with the 
GOM, as most of the key ministers have remained the same.  It 
appears Muluzi was merely tweaking his Cabinet to prepare for 
the May elections.  All but one of the people dropped from 
Cabinet lost primaries in their parliamentary districts, and 
many of the newly appointed members come from key opposition 
areas.  For example, Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Charles 
Kasunda is the MP from estranged Vice President Justin 
Malewezi's parliamentary district, and Minister of State for 
Statutory Corporations Rapheal Mhone is from the same 
district as Mgwirizano Coalition running mate (and former UDF 
stalwart) Aleke Banda.  END COMMENT.
