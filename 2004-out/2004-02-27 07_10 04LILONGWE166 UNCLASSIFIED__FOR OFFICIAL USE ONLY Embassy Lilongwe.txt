¶1. (U) Six presidential contenders declared their candidacy 
to the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) on February 25 and 
¶26.  Among them were the United Democratic Front 
(UDF)/Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) coalition's Bingu wa 
Mutharika, four from opposition parties, and one independent. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶2. (SBU) Vice President (and former UDF heavyweight) Justin 
Malewezi's last minute decision to break away from the 
Mgwirizano Coalition and contest as an independent 
presidential candidate typifies the increasing divisions in 
the opposition (septel).  With five candidates splitting the 
opposition vote, the UDF/AFORD coalition is well positioned 
to win with a plurality, reminiscent of the 2001 Zambian 
elections.  With three months left before polling day, the 
opposition's factionalization makes the UDF/AFORD coalition 
the clear front-runner.
