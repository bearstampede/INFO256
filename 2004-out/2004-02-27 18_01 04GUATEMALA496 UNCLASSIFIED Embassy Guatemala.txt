PolOff discussed reftel points with Silvia Corado, Director 
for Multilateral Affairs at the Foreign Ministry on February 
Â¶25.  Corado said Guatemala would not oppose efforts to 
dedicate this year's session of the UN Disarmament Commission 
(UNDC) to an appraisal of the UNDC itself, but would consider 
the position of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) before 
deciding to support such efforts.  Corado doubted any that 
issues related to the UNDC would be important enough to 
Guatemala to justify its opposing a NAM position on the 
subject.
