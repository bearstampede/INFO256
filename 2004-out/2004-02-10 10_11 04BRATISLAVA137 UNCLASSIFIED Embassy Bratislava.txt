¶4.   SECURITY: THE U.S. GOVERNMENT REMAINS DEEPLY CONCERNED 
  ABOUT THE SECURITY OF U.S. CITIZENS OVERSEAS.  U.S. CITIZENS 
  ARE CAUTIONED TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF VIGILANCE, TO 
  REMAIN ALERT AND TO TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO INCREASE THEIR 
  SECURITY AWARENESS.  THERE ARE INCREASING INDICATIONS THAT 
  AL-QAIDA IS PREPARING TO STRIKE U.S. INTERESTS ABROAD.    IT 
  IS EXPECTED THAT AL-QAIDA WILL STRIVE FOR NEW ATTACKS 
      DESIGNED TO BE MORE DEVASTATING THAN THE SEPTEMBER 11 
  ATTACK, POSSIBLY INVOLVING NON-CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS SUCH AS 
  CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL AGENTS.  TERRORIST ACTIONS MAY 
  INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SUICIDE OPERATIONS, 
  HIJACKINGS, BOMBINGS OR KIDNAPPINGS.  THESE MAY INCLUDE 
  FACILITIES WHERE U.S. CITIZENS AND OTHER FOREIGNERS 
  CONGREGATE OR VISIT, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL AREAS, CLUBS, 
  RESTAURANTS, PLACES OF WORSHIP, SCHOOLS, HOTELS, OUTDOOR 
  RECREATION EVENTS OR RESORTS.  U.S. CITIZENS SHOULD REMAIN 
  IN A HEIGHTENED STATE OF PERSONAL SECURITY AWARENESS WHEN 
  ATTENDANCE AT SUCH LOCATIONS IS UNAVOIDABLE.  EMBASSY 
  BRATISLAVA FACILITIES REMAIN AT A HEIGHTENED STATE OF ALERT. 
  THESE FACILITIES MAY TEMPORARILY CLOSE OR SUSPEND PUBLIC 
  SERVICES FROM TIME TO TIME TO ASSESS THEIR SECURITY POSTURE. 
 
¶5.   THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC HAS A +ACI-MEDIUM+ACI- RATE OF CRIME, 
  ALTHOUGH VIOLENT CRIME IS RELATIVELY UNCOMMON.  VISITORS ARE 
  URGED TO EXERCISE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS.  IF YOU MUST WALK 
  ALONE AT NIGHT, KEEP TO POPULOUS AND WELL-LIT AREAS.  PAY 
  ATTENTION TO YOUR WALLET, PURSE, HANDBAG AND CELLULAR 
  TELEPHONE, AS ALL ARE POPULAR TARGETS OF THE LOCAL THIEVES. 
  THE LOCAL PICKPOCKETS ARE PROFESSIONAL AND MOST ACTIVE 
  DURING THE SUMMER.  THEY TEND TO UTILIZE DISTRACTION 
  TECHNIQUES TO CONFUSE THEIR TARGET, PREFERRING LOCATIONS 
  SUCH AS SHOPPING CENTERS, MARKETS AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION 
  IN THE VICINITY OF THE +ACI-OLD TOWN+ACI-, NEAR MAJOR HOTELS WHERE 
  FOREIGNERS STAY AND TOURIST SITES, AND THE NIGHT TRAINS TO 
  PRAGUE AND WARSAW. POWER STRUGGLES WITHIN THE ORGANIZED 
  CRIME, WHICH CAN BE VIOLENT, OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME.  THIS 
  ACTIVITY IS NOT/NOT DIRECTED AGAINST AMERICANS OR OTHER 
  FOREIGNERS.  THE RATE OF AUTO THEFT, WHICH IS ALSO CONNECTED 
      TO ORGANIZED CRIME, IS VERY HIGH IN BRATISLAVA.  UP-MARKET 
  EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN CARS ARE PREFERRED TARGETS.  THE USE 
  OF ALARM SYSTEMS OR ANTI-THEFT DEVICES IS STRONGLY 
  ENCOURAGED. 
 
¶6.   MEDICAL: IF YOU EXPERIENCE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AFTER 
  WORK HOURS, CONTACT THE EMBASSY DUTY OFFICER AT CELLPHONE 
  0903-703-666. IF YOU CANNOT REACH THE DUTY OFFICER, THE 
  EMBASSY HAS A CONTRACT WITH AN ENGLISH SPEAKING SLOVAK
