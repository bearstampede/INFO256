¶1.  (U) This is an action request; please see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The GCC Secretariat's proposal to initiate 
region-wide free trade negotiations with the United States 
(ref A) has put UAE officials in the uncomfortable 
political position of having to support the GCC 'party 
line,' while at the same time, vigorously pursuing a 
bilateral TIFA and FTA agreement with Washington.  In a 
February 17 meeting with Econoff, UAE Director of WTO 
Affairs Saeed Al-Nasibi asked whether Washington had 
responded to the GCC proposal, and noted that a negative 
response from Washington could "put to rest once and for 
all" the possibility of negotiating an FTA with the GCC. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment and action request:  Although some UAEG 
interlocutors have voiced restrained support for the GCC 
proposal (most probably out of a sense of obligation to 
their Gulf brethren), senior officials have made it very 
clear that the UAE intends to pursue bilateral trade 
agreements with Washington (ref B).  They have said that 
GCC talks, which include Saudi Arabia, would "bog down" 
negotiations.  The UAEG would welcome, however, 
clarification of our preference to pursue bilateral 
agreements with the Gulf states vice a multilateral 
approach to the GCC.  We second Embassy Riyadh's request 
that Washington expeditiously provide a response to the GCC 
Secretariat's proposal, and provide talking points for use 
 
SIPDIS 
in the Gulf capitals, as well.  End comment and action 
request.
