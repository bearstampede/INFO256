(SBU) Embassy delivered Ref A points to MFA Energy Department 
Deputy Director General Hakki Akil February 11.  Akil said 
his government welcomed the Ukrainian decision, but he 
cautioned that they would not be ready to celebrate until oil 
actually flowed through the pipeline "in the right 
direction."   Akil said he had heard that Chevron-Texaco was 
"very interested" in negotiating a deal with Kiev to 
transport crude through Odesa-Brody, and expressed hope the 
USG would encourage such a deal.  Embassy responded that the 
USG has encouraged the GOU to negotiate with commercial 
players, and would stay engaged.  Akil responded that his 
government would do the same.
