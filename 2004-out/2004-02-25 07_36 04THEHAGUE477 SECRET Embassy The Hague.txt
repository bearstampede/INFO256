¶1. (S) Ambassador Sobel met with Defense Minister Kamp on 
February 19.  Kamp confirmed he was engaged in informal 
contacts with his European counterparts to discuss options 
for cooperation on PRTs.  Following a February 20 meeting 
between Kamp and FM Bot, the GONL decided to dispatch a 
reconnaissance team to Afghanistan in March to explore 
possible options for a Dutch-led PRT.  The team will likely 
visit two to three PRTs, such as the German PRT in Konduz, 
the UK PRT in Mazar-i-Sharif as well as a U.S. PRT. 
 
¶2. (S)  MFA Security Policy Bureau Chief Maurits Jochems 
advised PolMilOff that the GONL was considering several 
possibilities to include partnering with the Canadians and 
the Belgians, Germany or the UK (according to Jochems, the 
Germans have offered to reinforce a Dutch-led PRT). 
According to the UK embassy here, London's strong preference 
is to pair the Dutch with the Canadians since the UK is "full 
up" with the Nordics.  That said, if at the end of the day 
the only way to get the Dutch involved was to carve space for 
them in UK PRT, London would probably do so.
