E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: KPAL PREF SP
SUBJECT: SPANISH RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY APPEAL FOR 
ASSISTANCE FOR UNRWA 
 
REF: STATE 29074 
 
We delivered reftel demarche to Inigo de Palacio, MFA 
Director of UN Affairs, on February 12.  De Palacio said he 
could not give a response at that time, but would pursue the 
issue within the MFA.  On February 24, he informed us that 
apart from the current year's commitment of roughly 3 million 
Euros, the MFA could not provide further funding, as their 
current year budget is closed.  The MFA will begin reviewing 
future projects and contributions in late March.  De Palacio 
said he had also contacted the Spanish Agency for 
International Cooperation regarding possible funding, but 
that they fund only specific projects, and could not make 
general contributions to relief programs.
