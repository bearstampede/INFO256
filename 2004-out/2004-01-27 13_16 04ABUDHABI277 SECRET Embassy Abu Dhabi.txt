E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/26/14 
TAGS: PREL IZ TC
SUBJECT: Reassuring Gulf governments of U.S. 
commitment to Iraq's territorial 
integrity 
 
Ref: (A) State 14218, (B) Abu Dhabi 211 
 
Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, 
Reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
¶1. (S) On January 26 the Ambassador delivered ref A talking 
points to Deputy Prime Minister and de facto Foreign 
Minister Shaykh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan (HbZ) who said 
the UAEG was comfortable with the U.S. approach for a 
sovereign and unified Iraq.  HbZ also underscored the very 
important role that the UN can play in shaping Iraq's 
political future.  HbZ commented that it was important for 
Iraq, the region, and the international community for the 
UN to lend its voice and play a role in helping manage the 
transition from the CPA to a sovereign Iraqi government. 
As reported in ref B, HbZ wants the Iraqis to understand 
that it is not the U.S. alone that is driving the political 
transition in Iraq, but that the UN supports the U.S. 
 
¶2. (S) HbZ also told the Ambassador about his January 25 
meeting with Adnan Pachachi, the Iraq Governing Council's 
president for the month of January.  He said that Pachachi 
had briefed him about his discussions in Washington and was 
comfortable with the U.S. approach to the transition period 
in Iraq. 
 
¶3. (S) Comment: The talking points, which were left with 
HbZ as a non-paper, were a very helpful reassurance for HbZ 
who only a week earlier (see ref B) had told the Ambassador 
that he was deeply concerned about the possibility of 
further sectarian conflict in Iraq.  As an aside, the head 
of the Iraqi Liaison Office, Kussay Mahdi Salih, told 
Polchief on January 25 that it would be a grave mistake for 
the U.S. to allow a Shi'a like the Grand Ayatollah Al 
Sistani to lead Iraq in the future because he fears they 
would transform Iraq into another Iran.
