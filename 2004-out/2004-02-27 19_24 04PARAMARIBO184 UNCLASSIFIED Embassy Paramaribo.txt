SUBJECT: BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT TO VISIT SURINAME: TRADE, 
EXTRADITION TREATY TO TOP THE AGENDA 
 
REF 02 PARAMARIBO 1169 
 
¶1.  ACCORDING TO THE FEBRUARY 24 EDITION OF THE LOCAL DAILY 
"DE WARE TIJD," SURINAMESE MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY 
MICHAEL JONG TJIEN FA ANNOUNCED DURING LOCAL CARNIVAL 
CELEBRATIONS ON FEBRUARY 20 A VISIT BY BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT 
LUS INCIO LULA DA SILVA TO SURINAME AT THE END OF 
MARCH/EARLY APRIL.  SOURCES AT THE MINISTRIES OF FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS AND TRADE AND INDUSTRY TOLD THE EMBASSY THAT 
SURINAME'S MAIN GOAL IS TO SECURE A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH 
BRAZIL, WHICH WOULD GRANT IT GREATER ACCESS TO THE BRAZILIAN 
MARKET FOR RICE, WOOD, AND OTHER PRODUCTS.  THIS AGREEMENT 
IS ESPECIALLY NEEDED TO SHORE UP THE COUNTRY'S TROUBLED RICE 
INDUSTRY.  A TEMPORARY MEASURE THAT ALLOWED SURINAME TO 
EXPORT RICE TO BRAZIL AT A REDUCED TARIFF RATE OF 4 PERCENT 
INSTEAD OF THE 11 PERCENT TARIFF LEVIED ON NON-MERCOSUR 
COUNTRIES EXPIRED IN DECEMBER 2003.  (SEE REFTEL FOR A FULL 
DISCUSSION OF SURINAME-BRAZIL RELATIONS.) 
 
¶2.  SURINAME WOULD ALSO LIKE TO CONTINUE DIALOGUE ON THE 
INTEGRATION OF REGIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN SOUTH AMERICA 
(IRISA) PROJECT, A TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION PROJECT 
THAT WOULD LINK NORTHERN BRAZIL WITH THE GUIANAS.  THE 
PROJECT, WHICH HAS BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION FOR YEARS, HAS SEEN 
LITTLE PROGRESS TO DATE. 
 
¶3.  IN A FOLLOW-UP CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR, RICARDO 
    LUIZ VIANA DE CARVALHO, THE RESIDENT BRAZILIAN AMBASSADOR, 
ADDED THAT IT IS EXPECTED TWO AGREEMENTS NEGOTIATED WITH 
SURINAME, ONE INVOLVING AN EXTRADITION TREATY AND ANOTHER 
INVOLVING THE REGISTRATION OF BRAZILIAN NATIONALS, WILL BE 
SIGNED DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL VISIT.  THE LATTER ACCORD 
WOULD GIVE THE ESTIMATED 40,000 BRAZILIANS HERE LEGAL BUT 
NOT PERMANENT RESIDENCE STATUS. 
 
¶4.  COMMENT.  FOR ISOLATED SURINAME, A VISIT BY BRAZILIAN 
PRESIDENT LULA IS A CELEBRATED EVENT SINCE VISITS BY HEADS 
OF STATE ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN.  THE LULA VISIT PROVIDES 
THE VENETIAAN ADMINISTRATION WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE A 
TRADE AGREEMENT THAT GUARANTEES SURINAME GREATER ACCESS TO 
THE BRAZILIAN MARKET AHEAD OF THE UPCOMING 2005 ELECTIONS. 
A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH A POWERHOUSE LIKE BRAZIL WOULD BE 
TANGIBLE PROOF THAT THE RULING NEW FRONT COALITION IS 
ACTIVELY FORWARDING SURINAME'S ECONOMIC/COMMERCIAL 
INTERESTS.  MORE BROADLY SPEAKING, A TRADE AGREEMENT, AN 
EXTRADITION TREATY, AND THE GRANTING OF LEGAL STATUS TO 
BRAZILIANS HERE WOULD BE MILESTONES FOR SURINAME-BRAZIL 
RELATIONS AS THEY WOULD SIGNAL GREATER COOPERATION BETWEEN 
THE TWO COUNTRIES ON CRITICAL POLICY ISSUES (TRADE, LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, AND IMMIGRATION).  END COMMENT. 
 
¶5.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
