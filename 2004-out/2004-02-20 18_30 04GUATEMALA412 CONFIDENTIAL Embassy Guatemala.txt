SUBJECT: GUATEMALA SUPPORTS OAS PROCESS IN VENEZUELA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 36977 
 
Classified By: PolMiloff Rob Copley for reason 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Ambassador Hamilton raised reftel talking points with 
Foreign Minister Jorge Briz on February 19.  Briz responded 
that he has personally always been supportive of real 
democracy in Venezuela, adding that until recently, as a 
member of the private sector, he had maintained close contact 
with counterparts in Venezuela's business community.  Briz 
said the GOG would give serious consideration to making a 
statement either individually, or more likely, in concert 
with its Central American neighbors at the upcoming Central 
American Presidential Summit to be held in Guatemala next 
week (three days before the CNE announces its decision on 
February 28).  Briz took the Ambassador's suggestion that the 
MFA convoke the Venezuelan Charge to express the GOG's 
concern. 
 
¶2. (C) ADCM and PolOff backtracked the demarche with Vice 
Minister for Foreign Affairs Marta Altoaguirre and Director 
General for Multilateral Affairs Carla Rodriguez respectively 
on February 20.  Altoaguirre said the GOG will fully support 
the OAS and Carter Center process and said that the decision 
to annul signatures was "a provocation."  She added that she 
believes a referendum is the only way to avoid civil war in 
Venezuela and said she would give serious thought to ways the 
GOG can support the effort either through a statement at the 
OAS Permanent Council or a joint declaration by the Central 
Americans.  Rodriguez was aware of our earlier interventions 
and expressed appreciation for the talking points which we 
left as a non-paper.
