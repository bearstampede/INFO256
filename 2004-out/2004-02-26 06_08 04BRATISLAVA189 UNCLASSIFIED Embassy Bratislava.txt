SUBJECT: CHR 60TH SESSION DEMARCHE: SLOVAK RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 41252 
 
POLOFF DELIVERED REFTEL POINTS TO PETER PROCHACKA, DIRECTOR 
OF THE MFA HUMAN RIGHTS DEPARTMENT.  PROCHACKA RECEIVED THE 
INFORMATION WITH INTEREST, AND SAID SLOVAKIA INTENDS TO 
PRESERVE THE 30 OR SO CO-SPONSORSHIPS IT HAS COMMITTED TO IN 
PREVIOUS YEARS, SUCH AS ALL RESOLUTIONS TABLED BY THE EU AND 
    MANY OF THOSE TABLED BY THE U.S., FOR EXAMPLE ON CUBA. 
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER PAL CSAKY OR MFA STATE SECRETARY 
JOZSEF BERENYI MAY PARTICIPATE IN THE HIGH-LEVEL SECTION OF 
THE 60TH CHR, BUT THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN DECIDED.  SLOVAKIA 
INTENDS TO MAKE STATEMENTS ON THE SUBJECTS OF NATIONAL 
MINORITIES AND TORTURE.  ONE POSSIBLE CONFLICT WITH U.S. 
POSITIONS IS SLOVAKIA'S SUPPORT FOR AN ANTI-DEATH PENALTY 
RESOLUTION (A POSITION CONSISTENT WITH THE EU).  HOWEVER, 
PROCHACKA SAID SLOVAKIA WOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT 
RESOLUTIONS, IF TABLED, ON CUBA, BELARUS, IRAN, DPRK AND 
TURKMENISTAN.
