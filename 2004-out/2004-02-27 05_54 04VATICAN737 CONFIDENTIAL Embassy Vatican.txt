SUBJECT: IRAQ: VATICAN SEES NO NEED TO RUSH ELECTIONS 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: CHARGE D'AFFAIRES, D. BRENT HARDT.  REASONS: 
1.5 (B) AN D (D). 
 
¶1. (C) HOLY SEE COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR IRAQ FRANCO 
COPPOLA TOLD US FEBRUARY 23 THAT THE VATICAN WAS FULLY 
    SUPPORTIVE OF THE RECENTLY-ANNOUNCED DECISION THAT IRAQI 
ELECTIONS WOULD NOT BE HELD BY JUNE 30.  HE SAID THE U.S. AND 
THE COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY (CPA) SHOULD "TAKE ALL 
THE TIME THEY NEED" TO PREPARE THE COUNTRY FOR DEMOCRATIC 
RULE.  THE HOLY SEE UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS NO SIMPLE 
PROCESS -- SADDAM WAS NOT A MERE "PARENTHESIS OF 
DICTATORSHIP" IN AN OTHERWISE RICH IRAQI HISTORY OF 
DEMOCRACY.  WITH NO SUCH TRADITION IN THE NATION, COPPOLA 
SAID IT REMAINED A PRIORITY TO STABILIZE THE COUNTRY, ENGAGE 
THE POPULATION, AND ACHIEVE A GENERAL CONSENSUS SUPPORTIVE OF 
THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS BEFORE HOLDING ELECTIONS.  IN A 
PERFECT WORLD, HE ADDED, IRAQ WOULD BE READY FOR ELECTIONS 
RIGHT AWAY -- BUT THAT IS NOT REALISTIC.  HE BELIEVED THE 
RISK OF GOING TOO QUICKLY WAS FAR GREATER THAN THAT OF GOING 
TOO SLOWLY. 
 
¶2. (C) THOUGH COPPOLA REMAINED SUPPORTIVE OF U.S. 
POLICY IN POST-WAR IRAQ, HE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE 
SPECIFICS OF THE PLANNED TRANSFER OF SOVEREIGNTY TO THE IRAQI 
PEOPLE ON JUNE 30.  WHAT WOULD HAPPEN, HE WONDERED, IF AFTER 
JUNE 30 THE IRAQI GOVERNING COUNCIL PASSED LEGISLATION 
INIMICAL TO RELIGIOUS LIBERTY OR OTHER KEY VATICAN AND USG 
CONCERNS? 
 
¶3. (U) COPPOLA WAS APPRECIATIVE OF THE USAID REPORT ON 
EVIDENCE OF MASS GRAVES IN IRAQ THAT WE PASSED TO HIM, AND 
EXPRESSED SIMILAR APPRECIATION FOR RECENT BACKGROUND ON IRAQI 
RECONSTRUCTION AND HUMANITARIAN RELIEF THAT WE SHARED. 
 
¶4. (U) MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
