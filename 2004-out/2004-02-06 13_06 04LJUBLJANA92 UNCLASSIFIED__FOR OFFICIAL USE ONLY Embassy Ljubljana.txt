¶1. (SBU) ON 04 FEBRUARY, ECON SPECIALIST FOLLOWED UP 
REF A INQUIRY WITH BRANKO MAHNE, STATE UNDERSECRETARY 
AT THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT, DETERMINING THE GOS 
POSITION ON REF B POINTS AND DRAFT PROPOSAL FOR A 
BALLAST WATER DISCHARGE STANDARD IN REGULATION D-2 OF 
THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE CONTROL AND 
MANAGEMENT OF SHIPS' BALLAST WATER AND SEDIMENTS. 
UNOFFICIALLY, MAHNE REPORTED THAT "SLOVENIA WOULD BE 
SUPPORTIVE OF THE U.S. POSITION," BUT THAT HE COULD NOT 
OFFICIALLY SAY AS MUCH, SINCE THE "INTRA-MINISTERIAL 
PROCESS HAD NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED."  (NOTE:  THE 
MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT SOLICITS THE OPINION OF TWO FIELD 
EXPERTS, UNIVERSITY OF KOPER'S PROFESSORS DAVID AND 
PAVLIHA, TO FORMULATE ITS POSITION.  END NOTE). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) COMMENT:  WE EXPECT THE GOS OFFICIAL POSITION 
TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF OUR POSITION AS LONG AS IT IS LINE 
WITH OTHER EU MEMBERS STATES, SINCE THIS IS NOT A 
PRIORITY ISSUE FOR IT.  END COMMENT.
