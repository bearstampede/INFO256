SUBJECT:  SIXTH MEETING OF THE ICAO COMMITTEE ON AVIATION 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION:OUTCOME 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  THE U.S. WAS SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING MOST OF 
ITS GOALS AT THE SIXTH MEETING OF THE INTERNATIONAL CIVIL 
AVIATION ORGANIZATION'S (ICAO) COMMITTEE ON AVIATION 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (CAEP), HELD IN MONTREAL, FEBRUARY 
2-12, 2004.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RESULT RELATED TO AIRCRAFT 
NOISE WAS ADOPTION OF ICAO GUIDANCE MATERIAL ON THE BALANCED 
APPROACH TO AIRCRAFT NOISE MANAGEMENT.  ON THE EMISSIONS 
ISSUES, THE COMMITTEE ADOPTED A SIGNIFICANT NEW NOX 
STRINGENCY STANDARD THAT IS A 12% REDUCTION OVER THE CURRENT 
STANDARD.  THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR NEW 
PRODUCTION ENGINES IN 2008.  THE COMMITTEE ALSO AGREED TO 
PURSUE THE USE OF VOLUNTARY MEASURES TO REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS 
AND TO FURTHER STUDY CO2 EMISSIONS TRADING OPTIONS. 
HOWEVER, AS EXPECTED, THE MEETING FAILED TO REACH AGREEMENT 
ON WHETHER OR NOT EXISTING ICAO GUIDANCE ON CHARGES SUPPORTS 
THE APPLICATION OF CO2 EMISSIONS CHARGES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  THE SIXTH MEETING OF THE INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION 
ORGANIZATION'S (ICAO) COMMITTEE ON AVIATION ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION (CAEP) CONVENED IN MONTREAL ON MONDAY, FEBRUARY 
2, 2004.  APPROXIMATELY 185 PARTICIPANTS REPRESENTING ALL 19 
CAEP MEMBER STATES AND 11 OBSERVER ORGANIZATIONS WERE IN 
ATTENDANCE.  THE MEETING CONCLUDED ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 12. 
 
-------------------- 
U.S. DELEGATION 
-------------------- 
 
¶3.  MR. CARL BURLESON, THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF 
ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY AT THE FEDERAL AVIATION 
ADMINISTRATION (FAA) HEADED THE UNITED STATES DELEGATION AS 
THE U.S. REPRESENTATIVE TO CAEP.  ALSO ON THE DELEGATION, 
SUPPORTING MR. BURLESON FROM THE FAA WERE MR. GARY O'TOOLE, 
MR. ARCHIE MUCKLE, DR. LOURDES MAURICE, MR. TOM CONNOR, AND 
MR. CURTIS HOLSCLAW.   MR. STEVE SEIDEL AND MR. BRYAN 
MANNING FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, MR. 
CHRISTO ARTUSIO FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, AND MR. JON 
MONTGOMERY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE ALSO SUPPORTED 
MR. BURLESON ON THE DELEGATION. 
 
¶4.  ALTHOUGH NOT ON THE OFFICIAL U.S. DELEGATION, CERTAIN 
U.S. STAKEHOLDERS WERE IN ATTENDANCE AS MEMBERS ON VARIOUS 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER ORGANIZATIONS AND WERE CONSULTED 
THROUGHOUT THE TWO WEEKS IN MONTREAL.  THESE ADVISORS 
REPRESENTED THE AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION (ATA), ASSOCIATION 
OF AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES (AIA), GENERAL AVIATION 
MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION (GAMA), AND THE CENTER FOR CLEAN 
AIR POLICY (CCAP).  ALSO DURING THE COURSE OF THE MEETING, 
THE HEAD OF THE U.S. DELEGATION CONDUCTED FOUR TELECONS WITH 
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY TO APPRISE INTERESTED PARTIES ON THE 
PROGRESS OF THE MEETING. 
 
----------------------------- 
KOTAITE OPENS MEETING 
----------------------------- 
¶5.  DR. ASSAD KOTAITE, PRESIDENT OF THE ICAO COUNCIL, OPENED 
THE MEETING BY REMINDING THE MEMBERS THAT GLOBAL COOPERATION 
HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE IMPACT OF AVIATION ON THE 
ENVIRONMENT.  AIRCRAFT TODAY ARE MUCH QUIETER AND LESS 
POLLUTING THEN THEIR COUNTERPARTS OF A FEW DECADES AGO DUE 
TO THE CLOSE COOPERATION AMONG MANUFACTURERS, OPERATORS, AND 
REGULATORS.  HE NOTED THAT CAEP/5 HAD SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSED 
VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES SUCH AS A NEW NOISE STANDARD, THE 
BALANCED APPROACH TO NOISE MANAGEMENT, AND A WAY FORWARD TO 
LIMIT OR REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. 
 
¶6. DR. KOTAITE CONTINUED BY NOTING THAT CAEP/6 TAKES PLACE 
AT A TIME WHEN THE AVIATION COMMUNITY IS JUST BEGINNING TO 
RECOVER FROM THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF 11 SEPTEMBER 2001. 
HE THEN DISCUSSED ICAO'S ELEVATION OF AVIATION ENVIRONMENTAL 
MATTERS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION BY THE CREATION OF AN 
ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT WITHIN THE SECRETARIAT.  HE CONCLUDED BY 
REMINDING THE MEETING OF ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO ICAO'S 188 
MEMBER STATES REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENT - ONE OF THE THREE 
MOST IMPORTANT AREAS DEALT WITH BY ICAO TOGETHER WITH SAFETY 
AND SECURITY. 
 
¶7.  MR. GRAHAM PENDLEBURY, THE CAEP MEMBER FROM THE UNITED 
KINGDOM, WAS CHOSEN BY CONSENSUS AS CHAIR FOR THE MEETING. 
MR. S. TAKANO, THE CAEP MEMBER FROM JAPAN, WAS SELECTED AS 
THE DEPUTY CHAIR, ALSO BY CONSENSUS.  THE U.S. MEMBER 
SUPPORTED BOTH SELECTIONS. 
 
-------------------------------- 
AIRCRAFT ENGINE EMISSIONS 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  NEW NOX STRINGENCY STANDARD. 
 
¶A.  THE NOX STANDARD DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON THE CAEP ANALYSIS 
THAT WAS DONE ON SEVERAL SCENARIOS - A 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 
25% AND 30% REDUCTIONS (FROM THE CAEP/4 STANDARD) 
IMPLEMENTED IN EITHER 2008 OR 2012.  THE PRESENTATIONS 
FOCUSED ON THE WORKING ASSUMPTIONS, AND THE RESULTS THAT 
SHOWED THAT 10% WAS THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTION WHEREAS 
HIGHER LEVELS DROVE COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WITH SMALL 
VERY SMALL GAINS IN NOX REDUCTIONS. .  AT 15% THERE APPEARED 
TO BE A BREAK POINT WHERE GREATER TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES SEEM 
TO GREATLY ESCALATE COSTS.  THE STUDY ALSO SHOWED THAT A 
LOWER STRINGENCY LEVEL (10%) IMPLEMENTED IN 2008 WOULD HAVE 
ALMOST THE SAME EFFECT AS A HIGHER LEVEL (15%) IN 2012. 
 
¶B.  A NUMBER OF PAPERS WERE SUBMITTED ON THE NOX STRINGENCY 
ISSUE. FIVE EUROPEAN STATES - THE UK, GERMANY, SWEDEN, 
SWITZERLAND, AND NORWAY - SUBMITTED A PAPER CALLING FOR A 
20% INCREASE.  ACI PRESENTED A PAPER THAT CALLED FOR A 20% 
REDUCTION IN 2008 AND A 30% REDUCTION IN 2012, AND ICSA 
REPRESENTING ENVIRONMENTAL NGOS CALLED FOR 30% IN 2012.  THE 
DEVELOPING WORLD SEEMED TO BE IN THE 5% TO 10% RANGE.  THE 
UK ALSO PRESENTED A PAPER THAT QUESTIONED THE CAEP ANALYSIS 
SUGGESTING THAT THE COSTS OF SOME OF THE HIGHER OPTIONS WERE 
OVERESTIMATED AND BENEFITS UNDERESTIMATED. 
 
¶C.  AFTER LONG NEGOTIATIONS IN A MEMBERS-ONLY MEETING, IT 
WAS AGREED THAT THE NEW NOX STANDARD WOULD BE A 12% 
REDUCTION EFFECTIVE IN 2008.  THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT 
REDUCTION - AT LEAST TWICE AS STRINGENT AS PAST CAEP NOX 
STRINGENCY INCREASES.  ALSO, THE MEETING AGREED TO REVISIT 
THE NOX STANDARD AT CAEP/8 (2010) WITH A COMMITMENT TO 
REVIEW LONG TERM GOALS, DEVELOP BETTER MODELING, GATHER 
BETTER TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC DATA, AND LOOK AT 
INTERDEPENDENCIES DURING THE INTERVENING 6 YEARS. 
 
¶9.  PRODUCTION CUT-OFF OF THE CAEP/4 NOX STANDARD.  AN ISSUE 
RELATED TO AGREEMENT ON A NEW NOX STANDARD WAS WHETHER OR 
NOT THERE WOULD BE A PRODUCTION CUT-OFF OF THE CURRENT 
(CAEP/4) STANDARD.  THIS ISSUE BECAME AN INTEGRAL PART OF 
THE NEGOTIATION ON THE NEW NOX STANDARD.  ALTHOUGH THE U.S. 
POSITION SUPPORTED A PRODUCTION CUT-OFF, NEW INFORMATION WAS 
BROUGHT TO THE MEMBERS-ONLY MEETING THAT AT CAEP/4, THERE 
WAS AGREEMENT THAT THERE WOULD BE NO PRODUCTION CUT-OFF. 
THE CAEP SECRETARY CONFIRMED THIS INFORMATION AND THERE WAS 
A MAJORITY VIEW THAT THE CAEP/4 DECISION SHOULD STAND. 
REALIZING THAT THIS VIEW WAS CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING THE U.S. 
POSITION FOR NOX AT THIS MEETING (AS WELL AS THE UPCOMING 
DISCUSSION ON CHARGES), THE U.S. MEMBER RESPONDED BY 
INSISTING THAT PRODUCTION CUT-OFF WOULD BE REVIEWED IN THE 
TIME LEADING UP TO CAEP/8, AND THE NEED FOR, AND DETAILS OF 
A PRODUCTION CUT-OFF WOULD BE REVISITED AT CAEP/8.  THE 
FINAL DECISION WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO PRODUCTION CUT-OFF 
FOR THE CAEP/4 STANDARD.  HOWEVER, THIS ISSUE WOULD BE PUT 
ON THE FUTURE WORK PROGRAM. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
MARKET-BASED OPTIONS (TO REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS) 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
¶10.  VOLUNTARY MEASURES.  THE MEMBERS WERE ASKED TO ADOPT A 
VOLUNTARY MEASURES TEMPLATE.  THE TEMPLATE GIVES BASIC 
GUIDANCE AND STRUCTURE TO A POSSIBLE VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT 
TO REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS.  THE MEETING ACCEPTED THE TEMPLATE, 
AND AGREED THAT CAEP SHOULD EXPLORE HOW THIS TEMPLATE MIGHT 
BE USED AS THE BASIS FOR A REAL VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT, 
POSSIBLY BASED ON OPERATIONAL MEASURES, IN THE FUTURE WORK 
PROGRAM. 
 
¶11.  EMISSIONS (CO2) CHARGES. 
 
¶A.  THIS WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT ISSUE FOR THE MEETING, AND 
THE MEMBERS WERE UNABLE TO COME TO AGREEMENT OVER THE USE OF 
EMISSIONS CHARGES TO REDUCE CO2 - A GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS. 
THE DEBATE FOCUSED ON THE APPLICABILITY OF EXISTING ICAO 
GUIDANCE TO THESE CHARGES AND WHETHER THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED 
TO DATE WAS SUFFICIENT TO ANSWER A NUMBER OF LEGAL, POLICY, 
AND ECONOMIC QUESTIONS RAISED GIVEN THE NOVEL NATURE OF CO2 
CHARGES.  EXISTING ICAO GUIDANCE FOCUSES ON THE MITIGATION 
OF THE LOCAL IMPACT OF EMISSIONS AND NOISE, OR THE PROVISION 
OF SPECIFIC AVIATION SERVICES WHEREAS CO2 IS A GLOBAL 
EMISSION WITH NO LOCAL IMPACT OR HEALTH EFFECTS.  THE 
EUROPEANS BELIEVE THAT EXISTING GUIDANCE IS SUFFICIENT TO GO 
AHEAD WITH CO2 CHARGES.  THE U.S., AS WELL AS THE REST OF 
THE WORLD, OPPOSED CO2 CHARGES SUGGESTING THAT POSSIBLY 
SPECIFIC GUIDANCE COULD BE DEVELOPED IN THE FUTURE, BUT ONLY 
AFTER THE OPEN LEGAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES WERE ADDRESSED. 
THERE WAS ALSO SENTIMENT BY SOME OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD 
THAT ANY CHARGING SCHEME EVENTUALLY DEVELOPED- WHETHER ON 
CO2 OR LOCAL AIR QUALITY ISSUES- SHOULD  EXEMPT THEM.. 
 
¶B.  THE ICAO LEGAL BUREAU CONCLUDED IN A PAPER TO THE 
MEETING THAT EMISSIONS CHARGES ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE 
CHICAGO CONVENTION BUT THEY MUST BE BASED ON THE COST OF 
MITIGATING ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, THE COST MUST BE 
IDENTIFIABLE AND DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AVIATION, AND THAT 
THERE WERE OTHER REMAINING LEGAL ISSUES TO BE EXPLORED. 
THESE INCLUDED WHAT IS MEANT BY, AND HOW TO DETERMINE THE 
"FULL COST OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE," HOW TO IDENTIFY AND 
ESTABLISH CATEGORIES OF COSTS, THE GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE OF 
APPLICATION, ETC.  THE U.S. SUGGESTED THAT IT IS PREMATURE 
FOR ANY STATE TO IMPLEMENT CO2 CHARGES UNTIL THESE ISSUES 
CAN BE FURTHER STUDIED, AND THAT THESE ISSUES COULD BE TAKEN 
UP BY THE ICAO LEGAL COMMITTEE - A BODY OF MEMBER STATES. 
 
¶C.  THE MEETING COULD NOT AGREE ON RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE 
COUNCIL.  INSTEAD, DIFFERING VIEWS WERE DOCUMENTED AND WILL 
BE FORWARDED AS A POLICY ISSUE TO THE ICAO COUNCIL, AND 
POSSIBLY THE 35TH ICAO ASSEMBLY AT THE END OF 2004. 
 
¶12.  EMISSIONS TRADING. 
 
¶A.  THE MEETING CONSIDERED THREE OPTIONS (OR "AVENUES") FOR 
CONSIDERATION IN FURTHER STUDY OF EMISSIONS TRADING.  THE 
AVENUES WERE A TRADING SCHEME BASED ON 1) INTEGRATED TRADING 
UNDER THE KYOTO PROTOCOL, 2) A NEW LEGAL INSTRUMENT WITHIN 
ICAO, AND 3) A VOLUNTARY TRADING APPROACH.  THERE APPEARED 
TO BE GENERAL SUPPORT FROM DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES FOR 
CONTINUING AVENUES 1 AND 3.  MANY SAW AVENUE 3 AS A 
PRECURSOR TO AVENUE 1 WHILE THE U.S. ARGUED THAT A VOLUNTARY 
ARRANGEMENT COULD BE PURSUED ON ITS OWN MERIT - NOT 
NECESSARILY AS A LEAD IN TO A FUTURE MANDATORY ARRANGEMENT. 
THERE WAS NEARLY UNIVERSAL AGREEMENT ON THE ELIMINATION OF 
AVENUE 2 BASED ON THE DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING A NEW ICAO 
LEGAL INSTRUMENT UNDER THE CHICAGO CONVENTION. 
 
¶B.  DURING THE DEBATE, THE ISSUE OF ALLOCATION OF 
INTERNATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CAME UP.  SEVERAL 
STATES FROM EUROPE, AND CANADA AND BRAZIL SUGGESTED THAT THE 
ISSUE OF THE ALLOCATION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS NEEDED 
TO BE RESOLVED FOR ICAO TO PURSUE THESE EMISSIONS TRADING 
AVENUES - ESPECIALLY AVENUE 1. 
 
¶C.  FINALLY, LANGUAGE WAS AGREED THAT RULED OUT AVENUE 2 FOR 
FURTHER CONSIDERATION, SUPPORTED FURTHER PURSUIT OF AVENUE 
3, AND AGREED THAT WORK SHOULD CONTINUE ON AVENUE 1 TO 
PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR STATES FOR TRADING SCHEMES CONSISTENT 
WITH THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE UNFCCC PROCESS (THE U.S. 
MANAGED TO GET ANY REFERENCE TO KYOTO DROPPED). 
 
------------------ 
AIRCRAFT NOISE 
------------------ 
¶13.  BALANCED APPROACH FOR AIRCRAFT NOISE MANAGEMENT.  IN A 
MAJOR VICTORY FOR THE U.S., THE MEETING ADOPTED THE DRAFT 
GUIDANCE MATERIAL ON THE BALANCED APPROACH TO AIRCRAFT NOISE 
MANAGEMENT AS DRAFTED AND AS SUPPORTED BY THE U.S.  THE 
DISCUSSIONS PREDICTABLY ADDRESSED WHETHER THE DOCUMENT WAS 
SUFFICIENT TO SEND FORWARD TO THE COUNCIL FOR ADOPTION - WAS 
IT COMPLETE, DID IT ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF ALL MEMBER STATES, 
ETC.?  IN CONCLUSION, THE MEETING ACCEPTED THE MAIN DOCUMENT 
AND MOST OF ITS ANNEXES WITH NO CHANGES.  TWO ANNEXES WILL 
BE REFERRED FOR FUTURE WORK - CASE STUDIES THAT DEMONSTRATE 
HOW AIRPORTS HAVE APPLIED ELEMENTS OF THE BALANCED APPROACH 
AND INFORMATION ON ENCROACHMENT STUDIES.  THIS WAS A CLEAR 
VICTORY FOR THE U.S. 
 
¶14.  NOISE CERTIFICATION DOCUMENTATION. 
 
¶A.  SEVERAL CAEP MEMBER STATES HAVE BEEN PUSHING TO HAVE ONE 
STANDARDIZED NOISE CERTIFICATE ON BOARD THE AIRCRAFT. 
EUROPEAN STATES REQUIRE A STAND-ALONE NOISE CERTIFICATE 
CARRIED ON BOARD THE AIRCRAFT WHEREAS THE U.S. DOCUMENTS 
NOISE CERTIFICATION IN THE AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL.  THERE 
ARE CURRENTLY SEVERAL DIFFERENT METHODS IN USE 
INTERNATIONALLY.  IN VIEW OF THE WIDE VARIETY OF 
ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS ALREADY IN USE FOR NOISE 
CERTIFICATION DOCUMENTATION, IT WAS DEEMED NECESSARY TO 
ADOPT THREE ALTERNATIVE STANDARDIZED OPTIONS.  THE THREE 
OPTIONS ARE: 
 
  1)   ALL INFORMATION ITEMS CONTAINED IN A SINGLE DOCUMENT, A 
     STAND ALONE NOISE CERTIFICATE; 
 
  2)   TWO COMPLEMENTARY DOCUMENTS OF WHICH THE SECOND WOULD 
     BE THE AFM OR THE AIRCRAFT OPERATING MANUAL (AOM); AND 
 
  3)   THREE COMPLEMENTARY DOCUMENTS. 
 
¶B.  ALTHOUGH SEVERAL MEMBERS FAVORED ONE STAND-ALONE NOISE 
CERTIFICATE, IT WAS RECOGNIZED THAT THIS PROPOSAL WAS A 
LARGE LEAP FORWARD, AND DUE TO EXISTING STATE PRACTICES, 
GOING ANY FARTHER AT THIS TIME WOULD NOT BE PRACTICABLE. 
THE MEETING AGREED TO ACCEPT THE THREE OPTIONS, BUT TO 
REVISIT THE ISSUE IN THE FUTURE. 
 
¶15.  ENGINE THRUST DERATE. 
 
¶A.  THIS DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON THE METHOD USED TO ENSURE 
COMPLIANCE WITH REDUCED THRUST REQUIREMENTS FOR NOISE 
REDUCTIONS.  THE MEETING CONSIDERED THREE WAYS THAT A THRUST 
DERATE COULD BE IMPLEMENTED.  THESE INCLUDED A REVISION TO 
THE AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL (AFM), A PHYSICAL ENGINE THRUST 
LIMITATION OR A RE-DESIGNATION OF THE ENGINE. 
 
¶B.  THE EUROPEAN VIEW, ONE ENSHRINED IN EUROPEAN CIVIL 
AVIATION CONFERENCE (ECAC) PROCEDURES, REQUIRES A PHYSICAL 
LIMITATION TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.  THE U.S. VIEW, SUPPORTED 
IN A WORKING PAPER PRESENTED BY THE U.S. MEMBER, IS THAT AN 
AFM ENTRY IS SUFFICIENT.  THE U.S. ARGUMENT IS THAT THE AFM 
IS SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE SAFETY COMPLIANCE, AND HAS BEEN THE 
ACCEPTED METHODOLOGY INTERNATIONALLY TO ENSURE SAFETY. 
¶C.  SINCE ALL THREE OPTIONS WILL NEED TO BE EXPLORED IN 
FUTURE WORK, INTERIM GUIDANCE WAS PRESENTED FOR USE WHILE 
THIS ISSUE IS CONSIDERED FURTHER.  THE U.S. AND OTHERS WERE 
CONCERNED THAT THE INTERIM GUIDANCE SEEMED TO BE A STEP-BY- 
STEP PROCESS THAT WOULD LEAD TO PHYSICAL LIMITS.  THE 
INTERIM GUIDANCE WAS FINALLY REDRAFTED TO ONLY SUGGEST THAT 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE, AND THAT IT 
IS UP TO THE CERTIFICATING AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE. 
 
¶16.  REVISION OF NOISE LEVELS WITHIN THE SAME CHAPTER. 
THERE WAS ALSO SOME DISCUSSION OF THE METHODOLOGY TO BE USED 
IN THE REVISION OF NOISE LEVELS WITHIN THE SAME 
CERTIFICATION STANDARD, OR CHAPTER.  THE MEETING AGREED THAT 
THERE IS A NEED TO REVISE THE NOISE LEVELS OF SOME AIRCRAFT 
WITHIN THE SAME CHAPTER, AND ENDORSED THE NEED TO DEVELOP 
GUIDANCE ON THIS ISSUE WITHIN THE FUTURE WORK PROGRAM. 
 
¶17.  ALIGNMENT OF HELICOPTER NOISE CERTIFICATION STANDARDS. 
THE MEETING ACCEPTED NEW LANGUAGE FOR ICAO ANNEX 6 - 
OPERATION OF AIRCRAFT, PART III - INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS - 
HELICOPTERS, TO ALIGN ANNEX 6 PROVISIONS WITH THE RELEVANT 
HELICOPTER NOISE PROVISIONS OF ANNEX 16 - ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION, VOLUME I - AIRCRAFT NOISE.  THE TEXT CURRENTLY 
SUGGESTS THAT ALL HELICOPTERS ARE REQUIRED TO CARRY A NOISE 
CERTIFICATION DOCUMENT WHEN IN FACT SOME HELICOPTERS, AS 
SPECIFIED IN ANNEX 16 ARE EXEMPT FROM NOISE CERTIFICATION 
REQUIREMENTS. 
 
---------------------- 
FUTURE WORK 
---------------------- 
¶18.  CAEP WORKING METHODS.  THE U.S. HAD LED AN INTERNAL 
CAEP TASK FORCE TO EXAMINE THE STRUCTURE AND PROCESSES OF 
CAEP OVER THE LAST TWO-AND-A HALF YEARS.  THIS WAS INITIATED 
AT THE REQUEST OF THE ICAO PRESIDENT, DR. KOTAITE.  THE TASK 
FORCE RECOMMENDED TO THE MEETING THAT THREE AREAS NEEDED TO 
BE DEVELOPED - ORGANIZATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS, CAEP 
STRUCTURE, AND ICAO RESOURCES. 
¶A.  GOALS - THESE WOULD NEED TO BE SET NECESSARILY BROAD 
BECAUSE OF THEIR GLOBAL NATURE, AND THE VARYING NEEDS OF 
ICAO'S 188 MEMBER STATES.  THEY WERE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT IN 
HELPING SET ORGANIZATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITIES, AND IN 
MEASURING THE SUCCESS OF THE CAEP WORK PROGRAM.  THE MEETING 
AGREED ON THE FOLLOWING:  ICAO IS CONSCIOUS OF ITS 
RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT OF ITS CONTRACTING STATES TO ACHIEVE 
MAXIMUM COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE SAFE AND ORDERLY 
DEVELOPMENT OF CIVIL AVIATION AND THE QUALITY OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT.  IN CARRYING ON ITS RESPONSIBILITY, ICAO WILL 
STRIVE TO: 
 
  1)   LIMIT OR REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY 
     SIGNIFICANT AIRCRAFT NOISE; 
 
  2)   LIMIT OR REDUCE THE IMPACT OF AVIATION EMISSIONS ON 
     LOCAL AIR QUALITY; AND 
 
  3)   LIMIT OR REDUCE AVIATION GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ON 
     THE GLOBAL CLIMATE. 
 
¶B.  CAEP STRUCTURE - WITH A VIEW TO STREAMLINING THE 
PROCESS, TO BETTER COORDINATING THE WORK OF VARIOUS TASK 
GROUPS, AND TO START TO DEAL WITH THE INTERDEPENDENCIES OF 
BOTH NOISE AND EMISSIONS, THE MEETING AGREED TO A SLIGHTLY 
STREAMLINED WORKING GROUP STRUCTURE.  THE TECHNICAL WORKING 
GROUPS ON NOISE AND EMISSIONS WOULD REMAIN THE SAME.  THE 
WORK OF WORKING GROUP 2, NOISE - AIRPORTS AND OPERATIONS, 
AND THAT OF WORKING GROUP 4, EMISSIONS - OPERATIONAL ISSUES, 
WOULD BE COMBINED INTO A NEW WORKING GROUP 2, OPERATIONS. 
THIS GROUP WILL DEVELOP GUIDANCE MATERIAL (FOR EXAMPLE, THE 
BALANCED APPROACH), AND EXPLORE OPERATIONAL ISSUES RELATED 
TO AIRCRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE.  CAEP'S ECONOMICS 
SUPPORT GROUP (FESG) WILL ALSO REMAIN INTACT. 
 
¶C.  ICAO RESOURCES - THE MEETING AGREED THAT SINCE ICAO HAS 
LISTED ENVIRONMENT AS ONE OF ITS TOP THREE PRIORITIES, 
SECOND ONLY TO SAFETY AND SECURITY, IT WAS TIME TO EXPAND 
CAEP SUPPORT BEYOND SIMPLY HAVING ONE STAFF PERSON ACTING AS 
THE CAEP SECRETARY.  THE MEETING ENDORSED THE CREATION OF AN 
ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT WITH DEDICATED STAFFING AND FUNDING. 
THIS HAS BECOME A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE WITHIN CAEP AND ICAO AS 
THE SECRETARY GENERAL ANNOUNCED, A MONTH BEFORE CAEP/6 
STARTED, THAT A UNIT HAD BEEN FORMED.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE 
UNIT CREATED BY ICAO WAS UNRESPONSIVE TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS 
IN THE CAEP RESTRUCTURING REPORT.  NOT ONLY DOES IT HAVE  NO 
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES, IT PRODUCES MORE COMPLEXITY IN 
COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION- AS ENVIRONMENTAL 
RESPONSIBILITIES ARE MOVED TO THE AIR TRANSPORT BUREAU WHILE 
THE ANNEXES THAT CAEP HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR REMAIN IN THE 
MORE TECHNICAL AIR NAVIGATION BUREAU.  THE REPORT OF THE 
MEETING EXPRESSES THE DISPLEASURE OF SEVERAL MEMBERS OVER 
THIS MOVE AND APPARENT CONTINUING LACK OF ADEQUATE SUPPORT 
TO CAEP.  THE U.S. SHARES THESE VIEWS. 
 
¶19.  U.S. INITIATIVE ON ADDRESSING INTERDEPENDENCIES OF 
VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS 
 
¶A.  THE U.S. DELEGATION ALSO PRESENTED A PAPER ON A VISION 
FOR THE FUTURE - DEVELOPING A MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO 
ADDRESSING INTERDEPENDENCIES AMONG ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. 
THIS PAPER CALLED ON CAEP TO CONSIDER THE INTERDEPENDENCIES 
BETWEEN NOISE AND EMISSIONS, AND BETWEEN THE VARIOUS 
EMISSIONS, IN ITS FUTURE WORK AND PROPOSED BOTH NEAR-TERM 
AND LONGER-TERM ACTIONS THAT SEEK TO ENHANCE ICAO'S ABILITY 
TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL ASPECT OF ITS MANDATE.  THE U.S. 
VIEWS THIS AS A USEFUL ANALYTICAL APPROACH FOR MOVING 
FORWARD IN DEALING WITH AVIATION ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN AN 
INTEGRATED FASHION. 
 
¶B.  TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON THIS APPROACH, THE FAA 
HOSTED A RECEPTION AT ICAO HEADQUARTERS FOR THE HEADS OF THE 
MEMBER AND OBSERVER ORGANIZATIONS.  THE GOAL WAS TO 
INTRODUCE A METHODOLOGY, AND THE CAPABILITY, TO RECOGNIZE 
AND ADDRESS THE INTERDEPENDENCIES OF ALL ENVIRONMENTAL 
FACTORS - VARIOUS ENGINE EMISSIONS AND NOISE - IN FUTURE 
CAEP WORK AND DECISIONS.  THE FAA PRESENTED ITS WORK ON 
TOOLS TO FOSTER A SYSTEMS APPROACH TO ADDRESSING ALL ASPECTS 
OF NOISE AND EMISSIONS ISSUES IN THE FUTURE. 
 
¶C.  THERE SEEMED TO BE GENERAL ACCEPTANCE FOR THE U.S. VIEWS 
AND INITIATIVE BY THE MEMBERS, AND AGREEMENT TO CONTINUE 
WORK THAT WOULD SUPPORT SUCH AN APPROACH IN THE FUTURE. 
 
¶20.  TECHNICAL WORK PROGRAMS.  THE MEETING ACCEPTED A LONG 
LIST OF TASKS FOR THE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUPS WITHOUT 
ATTEMPTING TO PARE THE LIST DOWN OR TO PRIORITIZE THE 
SPECIFIC ITEMS.  IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE WORKING GROUPS 
WOULD PROVIDE INPUT ON THESE ISSUES TO THE NEXT CAEP 
STEERING GROUP SCHEDULED FOR BONN GERMANY ON NOVEMBER 2004. 
 
¶21.  THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S. DELEGATION WERE PROFESSIONAL 
AND WORKED EFFECTIVELY AS A TEAM TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES OF 
THE U.S. POSITION.  DELEGATION MEMBERS REPRESENTED THE 
UNITED STATES WELL AND ARE TO BE COMMENDED
