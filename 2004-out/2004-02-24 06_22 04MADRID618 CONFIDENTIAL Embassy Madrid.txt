SUBJECT: SPAIN: EU TO BACK OAS POSITION ON VENEZUELA 
 
REF: STATE 36977 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick, 
reasons 1.4(B) and (D). 
 
(C)  Embassy made reftel points February 23 to Ernesto de 
Zulueta, the MFA's Deputy Director General for Andean 
Community Countries.  Zulueta said Spain was fully in 
agreement with all points in demarche but believed a 
Government of Spain statement on the issue would only inflame 
GOV sentiments against the OAS and Carter Center positions. 
Instead, Spain was pushing for a common EU position which 
Zulueta believed the Irish EU Presidency would issue in a 
declaration February 23.  Zulueta read us a draft of the EU 
declaration -- the EU declaration tracked completely in 
substance with reftel points.  Zulueta promised to inform us 
if it appeared the declaration would be changed in any 
significant way before issuance.
