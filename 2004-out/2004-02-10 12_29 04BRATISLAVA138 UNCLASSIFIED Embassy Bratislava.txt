SUBJECT: RADIOACTIVE SOURCES: SLOVAK REACTION 
 
REF: STATE 22020 
 
POST DELIVERED REFTEL LETTER AND BACKGROUND PAPER TO FOREIGN 
MINISTER KUKAN, AND POLOFF THEN MET WITH OFFICIALS AT THE 
NUCLEAR REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND HEALTH PROTECTION AUTHORITY 
TO DISCUSS TALKING POINTS.  THE NRA HANDLES RADIOACTIVE 
WASTE AND NUCLEAR POWER, WHILE THE HPA LICENSES RADIOACTIVE 
    SOURCES IN NON-POWER APPLICATIONS AND MONITORS THEIR USE AND 
THE PUBLIC'S EXPOSURE TO RADIATION.  OFFICIALS IN BOTH 
OFFICES WERE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT SUPPORTING THE IAEA CODE OF 
CONDUCT, HAVE PARTICIPATED IN ALL MEETINGS ON THE SUBJECT. 
SLOVAKIA APPEARS TO EXERCISE STRICT CONTROL OVER THE LIMITED 
AMOUNT OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL USED IN THE COUNTRY. 
SLOVAKIA PASSED AN ACT AND REGULATION ON RADIATION 
PROTECTION IN 2000 THAT CONFORMS TO EU DIRECTIVES ON THE 
SUBJECT.  OFFICIALS NOTED THAT SLOVAKIA IS NOT A PRODUCER OF 
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL, BUT THERE IS SOME STILL HERE FROM 
BEFORE CZECHOSLOVAKIA SPLIT IN 1993.  THOSE WHO USE 
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL IN NEW PROJECTS MUST INCLUDE A 
PROVISION IN THE CONTRACT FOR ITS SAFE TRANSPORT BACK TO ITS 
ORIGIN AFTER THE MATERIAL HAS SERVED ITS PURPOSE.
