SUBJECT: ITALY SUPPORTS UNDC "IMPROVEMENT SESSION" 
 
    REF: SECSTATE 39091 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR TOM COUNTRYMAN 
               FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  POLMILOFF MET WITH MFA DISARMAMENT AND 
NONPROLIFERATION OFFICE DIRECTOR FILIPPO FORMICA AND 
COUNSELOR PIERO SARDI ON FEBRUARY 28 TO DISCUSS REFTEL 
DEMARCHE (CONVEYED ON FEBRUARY 24).  FORMICA OPENED BY 
EXPRESSING HIS FRUSTRATION THAT ITALY, WHICH CHAIRED THE UN 
DISARMAMENT COMMISSION LAST YEAR, WAS UNABLE TO ACHIEVE ANY 
CONCRETE RESULTS.  HE SAID ITALY LOOKED FAVORABLY ON OUR 
PROPOSAL FOR A UNDC IMPROVEMENT SESSION TO ALIGN THE BODY 
WITH INTERNATIONAL SECURITY REALITIES, WHICH WAS "VERY MUCH 
IN KEEPING WITH THE EU'S SUPPORT FOR EFFORTS TO REVITALIZE 
THE UN FIRST COMMITTEE."  ITALY IS SUPPORTIVE, AND AGREES 
THAT THE UNDC SESSION SHOULD BE SHORTENED TO TWO WEEKS, BUT 
CANNOT GET OUT IN FRONT OF ITS EU PARTNERS.  SARDI NOTED THAT 
OUR INITIATIVE FIT WELL WITH KEY ELEMENTS OF THE EU'S 
NONPROLIFERATION STRATEGY. 
 
¶2.  (C) FORMICA, CONTINUING, PROVIDED SOME BACKGROUND 
INFORMATION HE THOUGHT COULD BE HELPFUL AS THE USG MOVED 
FORWARD TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR ITS PROPOSAL. HE EXPLAINED THAT 
THE EU IN JANUARY HAD DEVELOPED AN AGENDA PROPOSAL FOR THIS 
YEAR'S UNDC SESSION, WHICH IT HAD SUBSEQUENTLY FLOATED 
UNSUCCESSFULLY WITH THE NAM.  ITALY HAD ARGUED WITHIN THE EU 
FOR COORDINATION WITH THE U.S. ON A JOINT PROPOSAL, BUT 
IRELAND AND OTHER STATES INSISTED ON MOVING AHEAD 
INDEPENDENTLY.  THE EU'S PROPOSAL, WHICH FORMICA SAID WAS IN 
"FREEZE MODE", COVERS BOTH NONCONVENTIONAL AND CONVENTIONAL 
    ARMS: ENHANCING VERIFICATION MECHANISMS TO IMPEDE WMD 
PROLIFERATION AND SHARING BEST PRACTICES, INCLUDING REGIONAL 
APPROACHES, TO IMPEDE THE ILLICIT TRAFFICKING OF SMALL ARMS. 
 
¶3.  (C) SARDI CONFIRMED THAT AT THE FEBRUARY 25 CODUN (UN 
DISARMAMENT) MEETING IN BRUSSELS, THE EU AGREED THERE WAS 
MERIT IN THE USG PROPOSAL.  THE EU WAS FAVORABLY DISPOSED TO 
SUPPORTING OUR PLAN FOR AN IMPROVEMENT SESSION, BUT WANTED TO 
EVALUATE WHETHER WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD BROAD SUPPORT FOR IT. 
FORMICA CAUTIONED THAT, IF OUR EFFORTS MET WITH OPPOSITION 
FROM THE NAM OR ELSEWHERE, THE EU WITHHELD THE RIGHT TO "PULL 
ITS PROPOSAL OUT OF THE FREEZER" AND MAKE ANOTHER RUN AT 
HAVING IT ADOPTED AS THE AGENDA FOR THIS YEAR'S UNDC SESSION.
