SUBJECT:  SLOVAK MOD INTERESTED IN C-130 TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) THE AMBASSADOR CONSULTED WITH MINISTER OF DEFENSE 
LISKA AND CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF CEROVSKY ON 5 FEBRUARY 
AND 10 FEBRUARY, RESPECTIVELY, TO DISCUSS SLOVAK INTEREST IN 
ACQUIRING A NUMBER OF C-130 MEDIUM TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT.  BOTH 
LISKA AND CEROVSKY EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE AMBASSADOR'S 
SUGGESTION THAT THE SLOVAKS ACQUIRE 4 TO 6 C-130E TRANSPORT 
AIRCRAFT (WHICH ARE BEING REPLACED IN THE US AIR FORCE FLEET 
BY THE MODERNIZED C-130J, BEGINNING AROUND 2005-2006) UNDER 
THE EXCESS DEFENSE ARTICLES PROGRAM.  UPGRADES TO THE 
AIRCRAFT ACQUIRED WOULD BE PAID FOR OUT OF THE SLOVAK 
DEFENSE BUDGET.  AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE AMBASSADOR ADVISED 
DEFENSE OFFICIALS TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FINANCIAL IMPACT 
OF THIS ACQUISITION. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  THE ACQUISITION OF THIS TYPE OF AIRCRAFT HAS 
THREE MAIN BENEFITS TO THE SLOVAK ARMED FORCES.  FIRST, IT 
WOULD PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY TO SELF-DEPLOY ITS FORCES TO 
NATO AND OTHER COALITION OPERATIONS, ELIMINATING THE NEED TO 
SECURE CONTRACT STRATEGIC LIFT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH AS 
UKRAINE OR RUSSIA.  SECOND, SLOVAKIA WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER 
THEATER LIFT ASSETS TO NATO OR COALITION OPERATIONS, THUS 
DEVELOPING A SORELY NEEDED NATO NICHE CAPABILITY.  FINALLY, 
THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY FOR SLOVAKIA TO CONTRACT ITS 
THEATER LIFT TO OTHER NATIONS IN THE REGION, WHICH 
REPRESENTS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF REVENUE AS WELL AS PRESTIGE 
IN THE REGION.  FURTHERMORE, THE SLOVAKS MAY WELL CONSIDER 
ATTEMPTING TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT IN REPAIR FACILITIES 
    LOCATED AT THE LETECKE OPRAVOVNE TRENCIN (AIRCRAFT REPAIR 
COMPANY TRENCIN) WITH THE GOAL OF DEVELOPING A REGION DEPOT- 
LEVEL MAINTENANCE FACILITY IN TRENCIN. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  A RECENTLY PUBLISHED STUDY ON THE FUTURE OF THE 
SLOVAK AIR FORCE RECOMMENDED THE ACQUISITION OF AT LEAST TWO 
MODERN TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT BY THE YEAR 2010, ALTHOUGH NO SUCH 
PLANS HAD BEEN MADE IN THE SLOVAKS' DEFENSE REFORM PLAN 
¶2010.  DURING AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO SLOVAKIA BY SUPREME 
ALLIED COMMANDER EUROPE (SACEUR), CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF 
CEROVKSY DISCUSSED THE C-130 AS A POSSIBLE NICHE CAPABILITY 
FOR SLOVAKIA.  GEN JONES CONFIRMED THAT LIFT WAS PERHAPS THE 
MOST IMPORTANT NEED FOR NATO FORCES AND RECOMMENDED THAT THE 
SLOVAKS SERIOUSLY CONSIDER ADDING THIS ACQUISITION TO THEIR 
PLANS. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  SLOVAK DEFENSE OFFICIALS ARE CAREFULLY EVALUATING 
THE ACQUISITION OF C-130 AIRCRAFT AND HAVE SUBMITTED A LIST 
OF QUESTIONS TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION BEFORE DECIDING TO 
PROCEED WITH A REQUEST FOR THE AIRCRAFT.  THEIR US ADVISOR, 
CUBIC APPLICATIONS, INC., HAS TOLD THE EMBASSY THAT THE 
SLOVAKS HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL TO SECURE FINANCING 
(CONFIRMED BY LOCKHEED MARTIN REPRESENTATIVES AS AVAILABLE) 
TO PURCHASE AND UPGRADE THE AIRCRAFT TO A FULLY OPERATIONAL 
STANDARD (COST ESTIMATED AT $50 TO $60 MILLION FOR 5 TO 6 
AIRPLANES) IF THEY WOULD GIVE UP SOME OTHER PARTS OF THEIR 
CURRENT PLAN WHICH ARE NOT BENEFICIAL TO NATO AND WHICH MOST 
PROBABLY DO NOT ENHANCE THEIR OWN DEFENSE CAPABILITIES.
