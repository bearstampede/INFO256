SUBJECT:  Urgent:  RFP #DABV01-04-Q-006, 11-03-03, IRAQI 
TRAVEL DOCUMENT ISSUANCE SYSTEM 
 
Dear Ambassador Jones, 
 
This law firm represents several American multinational 
companies.  It has been brought to my attention by a few of 
my clients that the subject 'Request for Proposal for Iraqi 
Travel Documents or Passports' was issued for solicitation of 
bids on January 20, 2004 and was given a deadline for 
submission of February 4, 2004.  The 2-week period for 
preparation of a proposal would be reasonable given the 
current emergency situation in Iraq, however, there is a 
4-day period of Muslim public holidays from January 31 to 
February 3, inclusive, which may not have been considered by 
the PMO issuing office.  This period is substantial when 
there is ahighly limited ability to gather local/regional 
input as well as local/regional involvement to the 
preparation of a bid proposal. 
 
This letter serves to formally request that consideration be 
given by the Coalition Providional Authority to extending the 
RFP submission deadline in order to make up for the loss of 
the holiday period.  We appreciate your efforts to carry this 
request forward to the relevant persons within the CPA 
organization and to assist American companies to obtain an 
extension. 
 
Very truly yours,
