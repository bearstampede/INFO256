SUBJECT: FM QIRBI ON WASHINGTON VISIT 
 
REF: A. SANAA 372 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 28746 
 
Classified By: Charge D'Affaires Alan G. Misenheimer for reasons 1.5 (b 
 and d). 
 
¶1. (s) In a February 16 meeting (ref a), CDA reviewed Foreign 
Minister Abubaker al-Qirbi's successful visit to Washington 
February 2-6.  Noting the positive meetings Qirbi had with 
the FBI Director and DCI, CDA said that arrangements should 
proceed soon for teams from the CIA and FBI to visit Yemen 
and to interview detainees.  CDA underscored to Qirbi that 
full cooperation is expected from the ROYG in securing access 
to Jaber al-Banna and the other detainees. 
 
¶2. (c) Turning to Embassy action after the visit, CDA said 
that we are preparing for the first Trade Investment 
Framework Agreement (TIFA) consultations, following up on the 
February 6 signing with USTR Zoellick.  CDA said the USG was 
pleased that the EDA boats for the Yemen Coast Guard had 
arrived 2/14, is planning for their inauguration in March, 
and would continue efforts to obtain export licenses 
expeditiously for other FMF transfers. 
 
¶3. (s) FM Qirbi described his Washington trip as excellent. 
He commented that in addition to fruitful meetings with 
Secretary Powell and other USG officials, it afforded an 
 
SIPDIS 
opportunity to engage with NGOs, particularly the National 
Democratic Institute (NDI). Qirbi expressed regret that he 
was unable to meet with Freedom House.  Comment: Qirbi's 
focus on NGOs reflects Yemen's aspirations of qualifying for 
the Millennium Challenge Account.  His visits to NGOs 
afforded a good opportunity to pitch Yemen's democratic 
progress, which is particularly important in light of Yemen's 
scores in the Democracy and Governance category for 
Millennium Challenge Account qualification.  End Comment.
