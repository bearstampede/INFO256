E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/12/2014 
TAGS: PREL MOPS EFIN ETTC KAWC ZL IT ICTY EUN
SUBJECT: OPERATION BALKAN VICE III - ITALY ON BOARD WITH 
VISA BAN, WILL "BE CREATIVE" ON ASSET FREEZE 
 
REF: STATE 27291 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POLMINCOUNS TOM COUNTRYMAN. REASON: 1.5 (B)(D). 
 
¶1. (S) MFA BALKANS OFFICE DIRECTOR FERNANDO GENTILINI TOLD 
POLOFF ON FEBRUARY 12 THAT ITALY WAS "ON BOARD" WITH USG VIEW 
THAT IMPOSING TRAVEL ENTRY/TRAVEL BANS AND FREEZING ASSETS OF 
PIFWC'S AND THEIR MATERIAL SUPPORTERS ARE IMPORTANT TOOLS FOR 
ACHIEVING OUR SHARED OBJECTIVE TO STABILIZE THE REGION. 
IMPLEMENTING TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ON THE INDIVIDUALS NAMED IN 
REF A WOULD POSE LITTLE PROBLEM, HE SAID, AND PROMISED TO 
TRANSMIT THE LIST TO APPROPRIATE BORDER AND IMMIGRATION 
AUTHORITIES. 
 
¶2. (S) GENTILINI SAID THAT AS WITH PREVIOUS REQUESTS OF THIS 
TYPE, ASSET FREEZE WOULD NOT BE THAT STRAIGHT FORWARD.  A 
NUMBER OF EU MEMBER STATES CONTINUE TO HOLD THAT FREEZING 
ASSETS OF PIFWC SUPPORTERS WITHOUT CRIMINAL OR CIVIL 
PROCEEDINGS WOULD NOT STAND UP IN THE COURTS.  THAT SAID, 
ITALY WOULD CONTINUE TO "BE CREATIVE" IN ATTEMPTS TO FREEZE 
ASSETS OF PIFWC SUPPORTERS.  GENTILINI SAID THAT AT THE 
FEBRUARY 12 COWEB IN BRUSSELS, ITALY SUPPORTED IRISH 
PRESIDENCY PROPOSALS TO "TEST THE WATERS" ON ASSET FREEZE 
WITH THE THREE UNSCR 1503-NAMED INDICTEES - KARADZIC, MLADIC, 
AND GOTOVINA.  AN EU WIDE ASSET FREEZE AGAINST THESE THREE 
MAY GAIN UNANIMOUS MEMBER STATE SUPPORT AND STAND UP IN THE 
COURTS, PAVING THE WAY FOR ACTIONS AGAINST "LESS SERIOUS" 
    PIFWC SUPPORTERS.  GENTILINI SAID THAT HE WOULD EXPLORE 
POSSIBLE BILATERAL ACTION, BUT DID NOT HOLD OUT MUCH HOPE FOR 
THAT STRATEGY. 
 
¶3. (S) ROBERTO CICIANI, DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MONEY 
LAUNDERING AND FINANCIAL CRIMES, SAID THAT WITHOUT AN EU 
IMPLEMENTING DIRECTIVE, THE GOI CAN NOT FREEZE ASSETS OF THE 
INDIVIDUALS LISTED IN REFTEL.  FINANCE WILL SHARE THE NAMES 
WITH THE CENTRAL BANK'S UFFICIO ITALIANO DEI CAMBI, WHICH 
WILL, IN TURN, INSTRUCT BANKS TO SEARCH DATABASES TO SEE IF 
THERE ARE MATCHES OF ACCOUNTS.  THIS WOULD BE DONE IN 
ANTICIPATION OF AN EU DIRECTIVE.  FINANCE WILL ASK THE 
MINISTRIES OF JUSTICE AND INTERIOR TO DETERMINE IF THERE HAVE 
BEEN ANY JUDICIAL RULINGS IN ITALY AGAINST THE LISTED 
INDIVIDUALS.
