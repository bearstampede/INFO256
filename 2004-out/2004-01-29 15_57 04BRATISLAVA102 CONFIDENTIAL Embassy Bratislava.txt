E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/29/2014 
TAGS: PGOV PINR LO NBU
SUBJECT: NEW NBU DIRECTOR FINALLY APPOINTED 
 
REF: BRATISLAVA 03 1079 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMB. RONALD WEISER FOR REASONS 1.4 B AND D 

¶1.  (C) AFTER MONTHS OF COALITION WRANGLING, THE SLOVAK 
CABINET APPOINTED AUREL UGOR AS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY OFFICE (NBU) ON JANUARY 28.  PRIOR TO THIS 
APPOINTMENT, UGOR WORKED IN THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE 
(VSS), SERVING AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE FIRST DEPARTMENT SINCE 
OCTOBER 2003.  THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION IN THE PRESS AS 
TO WHICH BRANCH OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE HE WORKED FOR, BUT 
THE SLOVAK INFORMATION SERVICE AND THE MILITARY DEFENSIVE 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE (VOS) CONFIRMED TO EMBOFF THAT UGOR WAS 
EMPLOYED BY THE VSS.  UGOR TOLD THE PRESS THAT HE INTENDS TO 
CONCENTRATE ON THE LAW ON CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND WHO WILL 
HAVE ACCESS TO IT.  HE PLANS TO MEET WITH HIS COUNTERPARTS 
FROM THE OTHER INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES SOON. 
 
¶2.  (C) UGOR'S NOMINATION CAME AS A SURPRISE TO EVERYONE WHO 
HAS BEEN WATCHING THE NBU.  THERE WAS ONE PRESS PIECE A WEEK 
AGO THAT MENTIONED UGOR AND HIS NAME RESURFACED ONLY A DAY 
BEFORE THE CABINET MET TO APPROVE HIS NOMINATION.  ACCORDING 
TO LOCAL PRESS, ANO PROPOSED UGOR AS THE NEW DIRECTOR, BUT HE 
DOES NOT KNOW ANO CHAIRMAN PAVOL RUSKO.  UGOR WAS SUPPORTED 
BY IVETA HENZELYOVA, AN ANO DEPUTY FROM KOSICE WHO HAS 
REFUSED TO COMMENT ON HOW SHE KNOWS UGOR.  (NOTE:  HENZELYOVA 
DOES SIT ON THE SIS OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE.)  A LOCAL NEWSPAPER 
REPORTED THAT ANO HAD APPROACHED SEVERAL OTHER NBU EMPLOYEES 
OFFERING TO SUPPORT A BID FOR THE DIRECTOR POSITION IN RETURN 
FOR GRANTING SECURITY CLEARANCES TO ANO LOYALISTS.  GIVEN HIS 
RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL POSITION AT THE VSS, EMBOFFS HAVE NOT 
YET MET UGOR. 
 
¶3.  (U) ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, UGOR WAS BORN IN 1966 IN 
    PRESOV.  HE STUDIED AT THE HIGHER MILITARY ACADEMY IN 
VYSKOVA, IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MILITARY ECONOMICS, GRADUATING 
IN 1990.  HE ALSO COMPLETED POST-GRADUATE STUDIES, 
SPECIALIZING IN INTELLIGENCE.  HE WAS NEVER A MEMBER OF THE 
COMMUNIST PARTY.  UPON GRADUATION, HE BEGAN WORKING IN THE 
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE IN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE.  ACCORDING TO 
THE PRESS, HE HAS A TOP SECRET CLEARANCE AS WELL AS A NATO 
CLEARANCE.  HE HOLDS THE RANK OF COLONEL.  UGOR SPEAKS 
ENGLISH AND RUSSIAN.  HE IS MARRIED WITH ONE CHILD. 
 
¶4.  (C) COMMENT:  THERE HAVE BEEN ONLY RUMORS AS TO WHY UGOR 
WAS SELECTED.  CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
FRANTISEK MIKLOSKO TOLD EMBOFF THAT PRIME MINISTER DZURINDA 
HAD AGREED TO SUPPORT CANDIDATES BACKED BY COALITION 
PARTNERS, AS LONG AS THERE WOULD BE SPACES FOR SDKU LOYALISTS 
IN THEIR INSTITUTIONS.  IN ADDITION, DZURINDA SOUGHT 
ASSURANCES FROM KDH THAT FORMER NBU DIRECTOR MOJZIS WOULD NOT 
WORK FOR VLADIMIR PALKO AT THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR. 
ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS AND MOJZIS, HE WILL WORK AT THE 
MOI AFTER HE COMPLETES HIS COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE AT THE 
END OF FEBRUARY.  MOJZIS IS SUPPOSED TO WORK IN A SMALL 
ANALYTICAL GROUP UNDER THE AUSPICES OF JOZEF SATEK'S NEW 
ANTI-CORRUPTION UNIT.  IF MOJZIS WORKS FOR SATEK, ANOTHER 
POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN DZURINDA AND THE KDH IS CERTAIN TO 
ERUPT.
