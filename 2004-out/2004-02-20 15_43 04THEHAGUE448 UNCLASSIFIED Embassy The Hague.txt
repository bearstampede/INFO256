SUBJECT: ENCOURAGING EU STATES TO SUPPORT AN ADEQUACY 
FINDING FOR PNR - DUTCH IN FAVOR 
 
REF: SECSTATE 35770 
 
ECOUNS delivered reftel demarche February 20 to Hanneke 
Boerma of the Dutch MFA's European Integration unit.  Boerma 
said that the Dutch would support the adequacy finding in the 
Article 31 committee vote on Monday, despite some misgivings 
on the substance of the agreement from data privacy experts. 
She commented that the Dutch recognized that attempting to 
reopen the agreement at this point would be impractical. 
Boerma reported that the key concern now on the Dutch side 
would be the enforceability of the agreement; she welcomed 
the additional commitments provided by DHS as helping to 
assuage Dutch concerns in this regard.
