SUBJECT: POSSIBLE CHR RESOLUTION ON IRAQ 
 
Ref: (A) CPA HQ 0615 (B) State 32070 
 
Classified by Ambassador Marcelle M. Wahba, reasons 
1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) The UAEG has been very helpful on Iraq issues, 
including making strong public statements in support 
of the IGC, and we would expect the UAEG to support 
the Governing Council position with regard to 
extending the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for 
Iraq (ref A). 
 
¶2. (C) Polchief delivered ref B demarche to MFA 
Director of International Organizations Yacub Al 
Hosani on February 15.  Al Hosani, who took over his 
portfolio about two months ago, was not familiar with 
the issue and appreciated the information.  He 
promised to immediately make calls within his 
government and to the appropriate UAE reps in Geneva 
and New York before the February 16 meeting.
