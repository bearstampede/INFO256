¶1.  (SBU) DCM initially raised reftel points  to MFA 
Assistant Under Secretary for Political Affairs Abdullah 
Rashid Al-Noaimi on February 14.  According to Al-Noaimi, 
the UAEG has already disbursed the $215 million pledge made 
at Madrid, both in providing humanitarian assistance and on 
buying Siemans generators for power plants in Iraq.  He did 
not provide any further details, but expected that the UAEG 
would provide further details on its assistance during the 
donors meeting. 
 
¶2. (SBU) EconChief subsequently followed-up on the 
conversation with Ministry of Finance Assistant 
Undersecretary for Revenue and Budget Khalid Al-Bustani who 
confirmed that he thought the funds had been disbursed, but 
noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had the full 
figures on how, where, and how much. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  The way the UAE provides assistance has 
complicated our ability to obtain a complete picture of its 
overall assistance program.  Much of the UAE's assistance 
is provided by the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which generally 
channels humanitarian assistance through the UAE Red 
Crescent and project assistance through the Abu Dhabi Fund 
for Development.  As a result the UAE federal officials 
frequently do not have full disbursement details. Despite 
the generosity of UAE assistance to Iraq, the UAE prefers 
to provide its assistance bilaterally and has - so far - 
declined to donate to the UN trust fund on Iraq.  The host 
of the Abu Dhabi donors' meeting is, therefore, not a 
member of the donors' committee. End Comment
