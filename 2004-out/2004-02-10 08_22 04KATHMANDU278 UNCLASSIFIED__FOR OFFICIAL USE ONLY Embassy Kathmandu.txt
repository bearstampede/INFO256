SUBJECT: NEPAL: MAOIST INCIDENTS LEADING UP TO 12 FEB STRIKE 
 
REF: KATHMANDU 253 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  On February 9 at approximately 1500 hours, 
suspected Maoists ambushed a joint security force patrol team 
in Lalitpur (located next to Kathmandu).  During this 
incident a police head constable and an army officer were 
killed.  In addition, on February 10 at approximately 0900 
hours suspected Maoists exploded a bomb in a normally busy 
shopping area in Kathmandu, which is frequented by western 
expatriates.  The incident occurred prior to the opening of 
business, and no casualties have been reported.  To the 
Embassy's knowledge, no Americans were reported present 
during either incident. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  The Maoists, who have called a general 
strike, or "bandh" for February 12, typically stage such 
incidents to intimidate the local population into complying 
with the closure.  As of COB on 10 February, no further 
incidents have been reported.  The Embassy will continue to 
monitor developments closely.
