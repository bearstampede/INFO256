GOC PRESENTS DRAFT PLAN COLOMBIA PHASE II DOCUMENT 
 
¶4.  (SBU) ON FEBRUARY 6, DURING HER MEETING WITH VISITING 
DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY PETER DESHAZO, FOREIGN MINISTER 
BARCO DELIVERED THE GOC'S FINAL DRAFT PLAN COLOMBIA PHASE II 
DOCUMENT, WHICH REFLECTED REVIEW/APPROVAL OF PRESIDENT 
URIBE'S FULL CABINET.  THIS DOCUMENT WAS THE RESULT OF THREE 
MONTHS' EFFORT BY SEVEN INTER-MINISTERIAL WORKING GROUPS, 
COORDINATED BY VICE MINISTER OF DEFENSE ANDRES SOTO AND PLAN 
COLOMBIA PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR LUIS ALFONSO HOYOS. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) EMBASSY FEEDBACK AND INPUT ON EARLIER DRAFTS OF 
THE PHASE II DOCUMENT ARE REFLECTED IN THIS FINAL DRAFT, BUT 
IT IS CLEARLY A GOC DRAFT.  ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE 
DOCUMENT HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO WHA/AND. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
PLAN COLOMBIA: THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) THE GOC STRATEGY BEHIND PLAN COLOMBIA IS VERY 
SIMPLE: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, SECURITY, AND PEACE ARE 
DIRECTLY LINKED.  THE PLAN ARGUES THAT STRENGTHENING THE 
CAPACITY OF THE STATE, ESPECIALLY THE MILITARY CAPABILITY, 
IS KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY NATIONAL PLAN.  THE WEAKNESS OF 
THE STATE IS AT THE HEART OF COLOMBIA'S ILLS.  THE MAIN 
REASON FOR POLITICAL KILLINGS (SOME 3,500 PER YEAR FOR THE 
LAST 10 YEARS), KIDNAPPINGS, DISPLACEMENT OF OVER 3 MILLION 
PEOPLE SINCE 1985, AND ECONOMIC DESTRUCTION IS THE 
INTERRELATED NATURE OF THE COMBINED THREATS OF NARCOTICS AND 
TERRORISM AND THE INABILITY OF THE STATE TO ACT, BECAUSE OF 
A COMBINATION OF LACK OF RESOURCES, LACK OF POLITICAL FORCE 
AND THE DEBILITATING IMPACT OF A WEAK JUSTICE SYSTEM. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) PLAN COLOMBIA IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT 
ELIMINATING THE MONEY GENERATED BY DRUGS REDUCES THE WAR- 
MAKING CAPACITY OF ALL THREE ILLEGAL ARMED TERRORIST GROUPS, 
THEREBY REDUCING THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE AND ENHANCING THE 
PROSPECTS FOR PEACE.  ADDITIONALLY, IT WAS ANTICIPATED THAT 
AS THESE ARMED THREATS TO THE STATE AND SOCIETY WERE 
ELIMINATED, THE FORCES OF PUBLIC ORDER (POLICE AND MILITARY) 
WOULD BE ABLE TO REGAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE ENTIRE 
NATIONAL TERRITORY, MAKING IT EASIER TO ERADICATE ILLEGAL 
NARCOTICS.  RESTORING SECURITY THROUGHOUT COLOMBIA WOULD 
ALLOW THE RULE OF LAW TO BE STRENGTHENED NATIONALLY AND LAY 
THE BASIS FOR INVESTMENT TO INCREASE INCOMES. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) PLAN COLOMBIA WAS AND IS AS MUCH AN ECONOMIC AND 
SOCIAL STRATEGY TO ENHANCE THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND 
DEVELOPMENT ALONG WITH A MORE FUNCTIONAL DEMOCRACY.  THE 
MILITARY COMPONENT WAS ONLY ONE OF THE PLAN'S 10 ELEMENTS 
DESIGNED TO REINFORCE DEMOCRACY, FREE FROM VIOLENCE AND 
CORRUPTION.  PLAN COLOMBIA WAS ALSO INTENDED TO PROMOTE A 
MORE EQUITABLE GEOGRAPHICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF 
THE BENEFITS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR THE COLOMBIAN 
PEOPLE. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) THE IMPETUS FOR PLAN COLOMBIA EVENTUALLY LED TO 
THE URIBE ADMINISTRATION'S ARTICULATION OF A COLOMBIAN 
NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY, QUOTE DEMOCRATIC SECURITY AND 
DEFENSE POLICY UNQUOTE, PUBLISHED IN THE FALL OF 2002.  THIS 
STRATEGY PROVIDES THE INTELLECTUAL FOUNDATION FOR LINKING 
THE NATIONAL MILITARY STRATEGY AND THE SUPPORTING SOCIAL AND 
ECONOMIC PROGRAMS NECESSARY TO BRING GOVERNANCE AND SECURITY 
TO THE PEOPLE.  THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS DEMOCRATIC SECURITY 
AND DEFENSE POLICY ARE TO: GUARANTEE THE SECURITY, FREEDOM, 
AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE POPULATION; CONSOLIDATE STATE 
CONTROL OVER NATIONAL TERRITORY; ELIMINATE DRUG TRAFFICKING; 
DEFEND DEMOCRATIC ORDER AND THE RULE OF LAW; PROMOTE 
ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND SOCIAL EQUITY; AND RECONSTRUCT THE 
SOCIAL FABRIC.  THE URIBE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE PROGRESS 
ON EACH OF THESE OBJECTIVES. 
 
-------------------------- 
PHASE II EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
-------------------------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU) AFTER THREE YEARS, PLAN COLOMBIA IS HELPING THE 
COUNTRY REVERSE 30 YEARS OF LARGE-SCALE DRUG PRODUCTION AND 
INTERNAL STRIFE.  THE GOC IS INCREASINGLY COMMITTED TO PLAN 
COLOMBIA, RAISING SECURITY SPENDING TO 3.8 PER CENT OF GDP 
IN 2003, WITH PLANS TO SPEND 5.8 PER CENT OF A HIGHER GDP BY 
¶2006.  THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY HAS HAD GROWING OPERATIONAL 
SUCCESS AGAINST NARCO-TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY, SECURING LARGE EXPANSES OF NATIONAL TERRITORY ONCE 
UNDER CONTROL OF NARCO-TERRORIST GROUPS.  A STRENGTHENED 
STATE IS ALLOWING PRESIDENT URIBE TO IMPLEMENT A QUOTE ZERO 
TOLERANCE UNQUOTE POLICY TOWARD COCA CULTIVATION THAT HAS 
REDUCED THE FLOW OF FUNDS TO ILLEGAL ARMED GROUPS AND SHOWN 
THAT PLAN COLOMBIA'S ERADICATION, INTERDICTION, AND 
ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS CAN MEET OR SURPASS THE 
ORIGINAL PLAN COLOMBIA'S GOAL TO REDUCE COCA CULTIVATION BY 
50 PER CENT BY 2005. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) PLAN COLOMBIA'S LONG-TERM INSTITUTION BUILDING 
ACTIVITIES HAVE HELPED COLOMBIA ESTABLISH SPECIAL HUMAN 
RIGHTS UNITS, REFORM THE CRIMINAL CODE, IMPROVE MONEY 
LAUNDERING AND ASSET FORFEITURE REGIMES AND PROTECT 
WITNESSES IN KEY CASES.  ACCESS TO JUSTICE HAS IMPROVED 
DRAMATICALLY, MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS HAVE 
BENEFITED COMMUNITIES, AND COLOMBIA'S INTERNALLY DISPLACED 
POPULATION HAS RECEIVED ASSISTANCE AND ACTUALLY DECLINED BY 
46 PER CENT IN 2003.  ECONOMIC POLICIES STABLIZED THE 
ECONOMY, WHICH GREW BY 3.5 PER CENT IN 2003 AND INFLATION 
WAS REDUCED TO 6.5 PER CENT, LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR 
INCREASED GROWTH IN 2004 AND DOMESTIC INVESTMENT.  THE 
IMPROVED SECURITY SITUATION IS LEADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO 
TAKE A NEW LOOK AT COLOMBIA. 
 
¶12.  (SBU) PLAN COLOMBIA'S ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE ARE 
IMPRESSIVE, BUT MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE.  COLOMBIA HAS 
NEARLY 35,000 MEMBERS OF ILLEGAL ARMED GROUPS, WITH BETWEEN 
6,000 - 11,000 CHILD SOLDIERS.  COLOMBIA LEADS THE WORLD IN 
KIDNAPPINGS, WITH A POVERTY RATE OF OVER 60 PER CENT, AND A 
NOTORIOUSLY WEAK JUSTICE SYSTEM.  TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE MUST 
HELP COLOMBIA ELIMINATE LARGE SCALE COCA PRODUCTION AND 
COCAINE TRAFFICKING.  THE INFLUENCE OF ARMED GROUPS IN RURAL 
AREAS MUST BE ENDED DECISIVELY.  THEREFORE, SUPPORT FOR PLAN 
COLOMBIA MUST CONTINUE. 
 
¶13.  (SBU) THE GOC PROGRAM FOR PHASE II CONSISTS OF FOUR 
PILLARS: 1. FIGHTING TERRORISM, NARCO-TRAFFICKING, AND 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME; 2. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 
REACTIVATION; 3. INSTITUTIONAL AND JUSTICE SYSTEM 
STRENGTHENING; AND 4. PEACE NEGOTIATIONS, DEMOBILIZATION, 
AND REINCORPORATION. 
 
¶14.  (SBU) THE GOC ESTIMATES THAT PHASE II COSTS WILL TOTAL 
DOLS. 7.2 BILLION, OF WHICH DOLS. 4.15 BILLION, 58 PER CENT, 
CORRESPONDS TO GOC RESOURCES AND DOLS. 3.04 BILLION, 42 PER 
CENT, IS THE REQUEST LEVEL FOR USG SUPPORT.  THE GOC PORTION 
ONLY INCLUDES OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT COUNTERPART RESOUCES, BUT 
DOES NOT INCLUDE LOCAL AND DEPARTMENTAL FUNDS NOR SUPPORT TO 
BE PROVIDED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND CIVIL SOCIETY.  THIS 
PHASE II PLAN IS DIRECTED TO THE USG, HOWEVER, THE GOC IS 
ACTIVELY COORDINATING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN 
SIX DONOR COMMITTEES AS PART OF ITS LONDON DECLARATION 
FOLLOW-UP. 
 
¶15.  (SBU) PILLAR ONE FOCUSES ON DEFEAT OF ILLEGAL NARCO- 
TERRORIST GROUPS BY COLOMBIAN POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES TO 
IMPROVE SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  DURING PHASE II, 
PLAN COLOMBIA WILL CONTINUE LOGISTICS SUPPORT, IMPROVED 
INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMS, AND TRAINING FOR POLICE AND MILITARY 
OPERATIONS AND WILL ALSO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR 
PROFESSIONALIZATION OF CIVILIAN AND MILITARY PERSONNEL IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS CONVENTIONS AND 
RULE OF LAW.  PHASE TWO WILL ALSO CONTINUE SUPPORT FOR 
ERADICATION PROGRAMS CARRIED OUT BY THE NARCOTICS POLICE AND 
INCLUDE TRAINING/SUPPORT FOR THE JUDICIAL POLICE. 
 
¶16.  (SBU) PILLAR TWO, SOCIAL/ECONOMIC REACTIVATION, WILL 
EMPHASIZE JOB CREATION BY BUILDING TRADE CAPACITY AND 
REFORMING POLICIES AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT.  LOCAL 
GOVERNANCE NETWORKS WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED TO STRENGTHEN 
COMMUNITY COHESION AND STATE PRESENCE. 
 
¶17.  (SBU) PILLAR THREE WILL STRENGTHEN DEMOCRATIC 
GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW - THE LINCHIPIN OF SUCCESS IN 
ELIMINATING THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF COLOMBIA'S ILLICIT CROP 
PRODUCTION AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  PHASE II WILL EXTEND THE 
RULE OF LAW, INCREASE SOCIETY'S CONFIDENCE IN JUDICIAL 
SYSTEMS AND CREATE A STABLE ATMOSPHERE FOR TRADE AND 
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT. 
 
¶18.  (SBU) THE FOURTH PILLAR WILL SUPPORT A PEACE PROCESS TO 
ENCOMPASS ALL ILLEGAL ARMED GROUPS AND LEAD TO THE 
SUCCESSFUL DEMOBILIZATION OF EX-COMBATANTS AND THEIR 
REINCORPORATION INTO COLOMBIAN POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND 
CULTURAL LIFE. 
 
¶19.  (SBU) MAJOR CHANGES IN PHASE II WILL BE: A. INCREASED 
EMPHASIS ON CREATION OF NEW EMPLOYMENT AND REACTIVATION OF 
THE ECONOMY THROUGH TRADE CAPACITY BUILDING TO EXPAND 
EXPORTS UNDER THE ANDEAN TRADE PROMOTION AND DRUG 
ERADICATION ACT, A NEW BILATERAL FREE TRADE AGREEMENT, 
NEGOTIATIONS FOR WHICH TO BEGIN THIS SPRING, AND THE FTAA; 
¶B. INCREASED EMPHASIS ON PEACE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WILL 
ENCOMPASS ALL OF THE ILLEGAL ARMED GROUPS AND LEAD TO THE 
DEMOBILIZATION AND REINCORPORATION OF THE EX-COMBATANTS; AND 
¶C. A SHIFT TOWARD GREATER COLOMBIANIZATION OF THE DRUG 
ERADICATION EFFORT AND ADJUSTMENTS IN THE ERADICATION 
STRATEGY TO REFLECT THE SUCCESS OF AERIAL FUMIGATION AND 
CHANGING TACTICS OF NARCO-TRAFFICKERS TO CULTIVATE IN 
NATIONAL PARKS AND INTERSPERSE WITH OTHER CROPS. 
 
¶20.  (SBU) IN THE EMBASSY'S VIEW, THE MONEY SPENT IN SUPPORT 
OF PLAN COLOMBIA HAS BEEN WELL SPENT.  THE GOC UNDER BOTH 
PRESIDENT PASTRANA AND URIBE HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE AND 
ACCOUNTABLE.  AS SENATE MAJORITY LEADER FRIST SAID TO A 
GROUP OF COLOMBIAN PRIVATE SECTOR LEADERS, "THE U.S. 
GOVERNMENT HAS GOTTEN ONE HUNDRED CENTS FOR ITS DOLLAR."
