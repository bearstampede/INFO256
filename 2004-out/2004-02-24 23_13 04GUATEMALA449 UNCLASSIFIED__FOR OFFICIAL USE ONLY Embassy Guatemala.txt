SUBJECT: ICAO'S MEETING IN CAIRO, GUATEMALA'S PARTICIPATION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 35954 
 
Guatemalan Civil Aviation (DGAC) authorities will not 
participate in ICAO's meeting in Cairo, nor have they taken 
any positions on key agenda items.  The new Director for 
Civil Aviation, Juan Antonio Presa, came to the job in late 
January with the change in government.  The new 
administration, at our urging, has made improving airport 
security a priority, and Presa's efforts are focused on 
securing the additional resources needed.  Presa seems 
sincere in his efforts to address serious weaknesses 
highlighted by a recent TSA team visit and with the amount 
and urgency of the work to be done, it is unlikely he will be 
prepared to focus in the short-term, on broader ICAO issues.
