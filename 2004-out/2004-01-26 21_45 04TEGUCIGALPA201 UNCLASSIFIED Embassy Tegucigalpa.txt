TAGS: PREL PTER KTIA XL XM CA HO OAS
SUBJECT: HONDURAN DELEGATION TO OAS CICTE; 2002 OAS CT 
CONVENTION PENDING CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL 
 
REF: STATE 11998 
 
¶1. PolOff delivered January 20 reftel demarche on the OAS 
CICTE to MFA Director for Multilateral Issues Wendy Flores. 
MFA Director General fro Foreign Policy Mario Fortin told 
PolOff January 26 that the GOH delegation will only be 
Frontier Police Chief Ramon Sabillon.  Note:  Sabillon is an 
excellent contact of the Embassy and the Frontier Police 
receives INL counternarcotics funding.  The Frontier Police 
is charged with handling counterterrorism law enforcement 
issues.  End Note. 
 
¶2. The GOH is still not a party to the two Organization of 
American States (OAS) counterterrorism conventions: 
-- 1971 OAS Convention to Prevent and Punish the Acts of 
Terrorism Taking the Form of Crimes Against Persons and 
Related Extortion that are of International Significance 
(signed by the GOH February 2, 1971) 
-- 2002 OAS Convention to Prevent and Punish Acts of 
Terrorism (signed by the GOH June 3, 2002). 
 
¶3. The Honduran Congress recently gave approval to the 1971 
CT convention and the official decree approving the 
convention should be sent soon for the President's signature 
and publication in La Gaceta (akin to the Federal Register). 
The 2002 CT convention has been debated by Congress but has 
yet to come to a vote. 
 
¶4. Comment:  EmbOffs continue to push hard for the GOH to 
become a party to these two CT conventions as soon as 
possible.  End Comment.
