¶3.  The Defense Contract Management Agency  (DCMA)-Middle 
East at Camp Doha, Kuwait provides oversight of DOD (Army) 
LOGCAP contract's task orders in Kuwait.  DCMA -Middle East 
tells us that -- assuming U.S. Forces remain in Kuwait after 
CPA is replaced by Embassy Baghdad -- the contractor 
services noted above are expected to continue to be provided 
under contracts administered by DOD, for Title 10 Support of 
Military Forces moving in and out of Kuwait and Iraq.  A 
partial list of U.S. contractors currently providing 
services in Kuwait, not necessarily overseen by DCMA, 
includes Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR), DynCorp, ITT, and 
Combat Support Associates (CSA), with KBR and CSA being the 
companies with the most personnel. 
 
¶4.  DCMA-Middle East estimates (based upon contract provided 
data) that there are about 1710 U.S. contract employees and 
about 272 third country national employees working in Kuwait 
under the LOGCAP prime contract awarded to KBR.  The sub- 
contractor workforce consists of about 3350 third country 
nationals. 
 
¶5.  Per U.S. Army Central Command (ARCENT) Army Contracting 
Agency-SWA-Kuwait, CSA has a workforce of about 1,190 U.S. 
civilians and about 1,650 third country nationals providing 
logistical and administrative support (not under LOGCAP) to 
ARCENT in Kuwait. 
 
¶6.  Post is unable to accurately determine from ARCENT and 
DCMA the number of non-KBR and CSA contractors operating in 
Iraq/Kuwait, as neither organization has oversight over 
those contractors/companies and their parent organizations 
are unknown top post.  However, it is estimated that this 
number could be in the several hundreds. 
 
¶7.  It is also difficult to estimate the number of transient 
CPA personnel and contractors moving through Kuwait to/from 
Iraq.  Note also that, for contractors who cross the border 
regularly, e.g., truck drivers, it can be hard to determine 
whether they are transient or resident in Kuwait.  Different 
Government of Kuwait paperwork is required for the two 
categories; this has already led to intensive Embassy 
involvement to ensure respect for Kuwaiti laws.  See Ref A, 
which seeks to clarify status of U.S. contract personnel 
working for CPA in Kuwait. 
 
¶8.  Ref B alerted Department on possible options for the 
continued operation of the CPA FDC in Kuwait, in case the 2 
person uniformed coordinating cell supervising that office 
goes away when CPA Baghdad is replaced by Embassy Baghdad. 
 
¶9.  CPA Contracting Activity advises that its current plan 
is to transition active CPA contracts to the new State 
Department entity in Iraq.  However, this transition does 
not include the contracts under control of CPA's Project 
Management Office (PMO).  Post is not aware of any plan to 
transition any CPA contracts to Embassy Kuwait when CPA 
Baghdad is replaced by Embassy Baghdad. 
 
¶10.  Baghdad minimize considered.
