¶1.  (C) The GoNL favors renewing Israel's WEOG membership in 
New York; however, it is unlikely to agree to enhancing 
Israeli participation in other UN fora.  PolOff met with 
Pieter Ramaer, head of the MFA's UN Political and Judicial 
Office, on February 27.  Ramaer stated that neither the GoNL 
nor the EU has finalized a position on this issue.  However, 
the Dutch believe that the current agreement limiting 
participation to New York is appropriate.  Ramaer said that 
the EU is concerned that Israeli participation in other fora, 
particularly Geneva, would foster a difficult WEOG working 
environment.  EU members are particularly worried about 
Israeli participation in consultative and information-sharing 
WEOG meetings at the Commission on Human Rights (CHR). 
Ramaer also noted that some in Europe are worried about what 
they see as Israel's desire to become a full member of 
Europe.  That anxiety, in connection with the state of the 
current Israeli political situation, will act against full 
Israeli participation in WEOG by some governments, he 
conjectured.  The GoNL would eventually like to see Israel 
admitted as a full member of the Asia group. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Ramaer did acknowledge that recent events in Nairobi 
(reftel) are problematic.  He has asked his Embassy in 
Nairobi to obtain further information, and will discuss the 
issue further within EU meetings.
