REF: SECSTATE 11998 
 
Silvia Corado, Director for Multilateral Affairs at the 
Foreign Ministry, confirmed on January 26 that Guatemala's 
delegation to the Fourth Regular Session of the OAS 
Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism (CICTE), will be 
led by Guatemalan Ambassador to Uruguay, Jose Luis Dominguez. 
 The other two members will be Marco Antonio Merida Zea, 
Executive Director of the Ports Commission and Elvis Molina, 
representative of the Superintendency of Banks.  Guatemala 
has not yet ratified the Inter-American Convention Against 
Terrorism, but has submitted its annual report to the CICTE. 
Citing scarce resources, Corado said Guatemala would not be 
able to announce any financial, technical, or other 
assistance to the CICTE at the Montevideo meeting.
