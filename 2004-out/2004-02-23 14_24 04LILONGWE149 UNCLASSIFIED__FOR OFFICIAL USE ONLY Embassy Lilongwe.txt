SUBJECT: CABINET DISSOLVED HOURS BEFORE ALLIANCE MOU 
FORMALIZED 
 
 
¶1. (U) Hours before signing a ruling United Democratic Front 
(UDF) and Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) MOU to jointly 
contest May's elections, President Muluzi dissolved the 
Cabinet on February 23.  No reason was given for the 
dissolution, and the Office of President and Cabinet (OPC) 
has requested that all matters requiring ministerial 
attention be addressed to the State House. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶2. (SBU) Considering the many concessions AFORD is making by 
signing the MOU (supporting both UDF's presidential candidate 
and running mate, and fielding candidates in only 38 of 193 
parliamentary districts), it is possible that Muluzi 
dissolved the Cabinet as a gesture of good faith to AFORD. 
With a signed MOU in hand, we would not be surprised if 
Muluzi's next Cabinet has several new AFORD faces.  In 
handing out new Cabinet assignments, Muluzi will also have 
the opportunity to remove UDF ministers whose support for the 
party has not been hard-line enough.  END COMMENT.
